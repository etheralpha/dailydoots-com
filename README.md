[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i5kiod/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2025/m89bqq9/)

In the year 2035, society had slipped into a horrifying new reality. Every person, every belief, every institution was reduced to a token on the Ethereum network. The world ran on the "Social Rank" index‚Äîan unforgiving system where everything, from politicians to popstars, nations to religions, was measured by the wealth invested in their tokens.

The value of a politician wasn‚Äôt based on their policies, but on the number of investments they could garner. Leaders like President Grayson, once a beacon of charisma, had become a shadow of themselves, performing for the cameras like desperate influencers, always measuring the worth of their next move in Ether. Their worth was no longer judged by the people‚Äôs trust, but by the wallets they controlled.

Popstars, once a symbol of cultural revolution, were now little more than commodities to be traded. Ariana Nova, the top-earning token in the entertainment industry, wasn‚Äôt loved for her voice anymore. Her every concert, her every social media post, was an asset to be bought, sold, and tracked. The richest investors controlled her, pushing her into increasingly bizarre performances as they tried to outbid one another for influence.

Even countries weren‚Äôt immune. The United States was a bloated behemoth, its tokenization so over-leveraged that it teetered on the edge of collapse. North Korea had somehow become the top-ranked nation, thanks to massive investments from anonymous wallets with dark ties to the underworld. Wealth no longer determined the quality of life‚Äîit determined who got to survive the longest. Borders were defined by token scarcity, and the most prosperous cities had become private domains, locked behind paywalls.

Religion, too, had been assimilated into the cold, calculating grasp of the DEX. The Church of the Divine Blockchain promised salvation in exchange for crypto donations, its ministers dressed in tailored smart suits instead of robes, praying not for the souls of their followers, but for more transactions in their wallets. The faithful were measured by their investment in the system, their spiritual devotion tracked on the blockchain, their worth increasing or decreasing with every shift in the market.

Life had become a relentless cycle of accumulation. People no longer spoke of love or loyalty, but of dividends and returns. The richest could buy their way into the highest social circles, where they lived in luxurious towers, insulated from the suffering of the lower-ranked masses. The rest of society had fragmented, the lines between the rich and poor drawn by the value of their Ethereum tokens.

And yet, even as the world collapsed under the weight of its own greed, the question remained: How much were you willing to invest in the future? Because in this new world, popularity and power weren‚Äôt given‚Äîthey were bought. And if you didn‚Äôt have enough Ether, you didn‚Äôt matter.

(bullish btw)

<summary>u/DCinvestor returns to update us on the EF leadership changes</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i41zsh/daily_general_discussion_january_18_2025/m7tnkcv/)

Hey guys, hope everyone here is well in this new (but old) home. I wanted to pop in today to share a few thoughts.

I'm encouraged by Vitalik's post (https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423) suggesting that change is coming to EF leadership. I agree with Joe Lubin's comments (https://x.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1880616193641640330) insofar as the environment has changed a lot, and EF leadership needs to evolve with it. I think Vitalik's suggestion that we bring more technically capable leadership into the Ethereum Foundation is the right move. I've made it no secret that I think Danny Ryan would be a great choice to lead the EF. Not only is he very capable technically, but he also understands the Ethereum ethos extremely well, respects its process of rough consensus, and is humble enough to engage others to support him in the areas where he may not have expertise without being threatened by them. If Danny is truly interested in such a role, then we'd be very lucky to have him. But I want to be clear that any kind of co-lead structure, or a structure which has Danny as CTO to someone else being ED would likely be counter-productive. A kitchen cannot have two head-chefs. On balance, Danny has credibility from the Community AND Core Devs. He's a logical choice and I hope Vitalik will make the right one here.

And while I don't love the framing in the second half of Vitalik's post, I generally agree with most of it. EF should not be doing "lobbying," which would involve engaging with legislators and policymakers to explicitly influence policy and legislation. However, I DO THINK that EF should not be afraid to talk to governments and businesses where appropriate to explain Ethereum's differentiated value prop and encourage them to build on it where appropriate. There is a difference between ADVOCACY & EDUCATION and LOBBYING. I hope that this is a distinction which the future EF leadership understands. And with respect to actual Lobbying, I've LOVE to see industry (apps and L2s) fund an actual Ethereum-focused lobbying org to influence in DC and beyond.

I think where EF can add most value in this very competitive environment is the following:

1) Enhance efforts to support technical development to ensure Ethereum remains competitive in the blockchain space. Right now, imo this means helping the community to make tough decisions about Ethereum's future in a timely manner and suggest appropriate prioritization of development. EF has always done this, but it will do it even better with deeper technical expertise at the top.
2) Redouble advocacy efforts to ensure that the Ethereum and ETH value propositions are well understood. We've outsourced all of this to the "podcast layer", and imo, that's been disasterous. Communicating about what Ethereum does and what its future looks like will NOT compromise credible neutrality. We need this now more than ever.
3) Lead by example by actively using Ethereum, and demonstrate to others how it can change the world. This means using and talking about the apps. Not acting like the app layer doesn't exist, or expressing disdain at the apps which currently exists.

I think ecosystem development has come so far in the past few years that I question how much more is needed. This needs to be refocused to a handful of priorities which we feel the open market cannot address effectively. It's hard to critique current efforts here by the EF, because much of it is opaque. But i'd much rather put 10x more effort into dev and advocacy is my two cents.

As for Vitalik's other points (some sort of trolling, lol), I think the message is that EF is not going to morph into some sort of super-dominant organization. That's fine, and that's not what we need for a credibly neutral network. But I'd LOVE to see an organization focused 100% on making sure Ethereum WINS the role of becoming the world computer and settlement layer and is not passive about centralized competition running the entire narrative and adoption cycle. IMO, this means burning harder than ever before on the priorities I mentioned above and jettisoning most everything else.

I hope you all are well. I'm still super optimistic about the Ethereum ecosystem, and change to the factors I mentioned above can only be a good thing!

[u/TheOnlyHodlerInCuau](https://reddit.com/u/TheOnlyHodlerInCuau):

Hey, some of you might remember me from the old sub. Got in on 2017, got drained (stupidly, my fault completely) a year and a half ago, lost almost everything, steped back for a while, managed to get a nice job, got back in the game. I am not close to where I once was, but I'm getting there.

My comment here is just to state that I'm beggining to loose faith in the space. Not because of the monetary aspect of it, (despite what I'm reading on other comment here, I feel like we are doing the same we've always done, underperform most of the time, then a fast pump up to track), but 'cuz it just seems tha the values we once held high have vanished.

We were suppossed to be revolutionaries.

We were suppossed to become a new monetary system. Something that the banks and the oligarchs couldn't control, so we could never have such a catastrophic management or uneven distribution of wealth as we had back when the idea was proposed.

Instead, I believe we worsened it. Grifters, gamblers, plain out garbage influencers preying on the weak minded, jobless folk who have 1k in their bank accounts and are desperate for a 100x that they feel everyone is getting only to find out that lost everything on the latest Cryto Ponzi.

Banks and oligarchs are celebrated when they pump our bags because fuck it, we were never about changing the monetary system, we just wanted to be part of the big boys club.

People mad at their investment that made them 59% yearly profit (ETH) because "What the hell? That other dude made more". 59% profit... and we're whining because some Ponzi is making more. Do you notice the greed?

It was naive to think we were going to change the world. Socio economic structures never change. Only the ones up top change every now and then. But I never tought I would one day feel disgust of the microscopic part I've played in this game.

I'm here, I'll stay here. Money is money. But we've lost the way.

The grifters and influencers are always the loudest. Please do not confuse them for the crypto ecosystem as a whole. It may not seem like it, but many people within the crypto ecosystem are in it to revolutionize the monetary system. They are just drowned out by bots and pump'n dumpers and shit on with negative engagement, which has been proven to have a much stronger psychological impact on the human brain. 

We are still here, building.

[u/curious-b](https://reddit.com/u/curious-b):

Consider the bigger picture. Crypto isn't changing the monetary system (yet), merely exposing it for the empty shell that it is. 

How exactly did you expect the transition to go? "Hi, we're here with a new, better monetary system" "Oh, that's great, here's the entire world's wealth, power, and control"?

The world is being thrown into chaos due to extremely rapid synchronized global technological, economic, and cultural shifts. Expect the monetary transformation to be anything but smooth and predictable.

My read is that the transition is starting by exposing the absurdity of the current system. Each time the silliness gets ratcheted up a notch (outside and inside crypto, think ZIRP, UBI, GME, FTX, DOGE->WIF->FART->TRUMP->???, etc...), it's another signal that the current system is broken, and that we are collectively reverting to a more primitive state of trying to figure out what money really is.

On the micro level, I think ethereum still represents the best values in terms of ethical alignment with cypherpunk roots, and VB's latest reaffirms that. Ethereum's core founders have all made their fortunes already, and as anyone of sound ethics realizes that beyond a certain point money doesn't matter, and they have exactly zero interest feeding into speculative bubbles over and over again. They're doing what they want, token price be damned.

If you're here to make quick gains, you made the wrong choice. Technical and ethical arrogance does not guarantee future returns (just ask XMR holders). If you're here to embrace a monetary revolution, zoom out and chill, these things take decades and nowadays everyone's attention is obsessing over the day to day.

<summary>u/Luukiemans summarises the latest memecoin shenanigans and issues a warning</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i4st8h/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2025/m7zrh27/)

What a fucking timeline we live in.

1.5 days ago Trump launches a memecoin on Solana. It blew upwards so hard it became the #2 memecoin within 36 hours (https://www.memecoinrace.xyz/). Everyone and their mom is celebrating the death of ETH and glorifies everything Solana.


Today, Trump's affiliated World Liberty Financial buys $20M+ in ETH + the whole ETH community is triggered from yesterday and the EF talks and rumours. Everyone absolutely tooting the ETH marketing/bullishness horn. As an ETH maxi that latest thing is great to see. Time we get vocal!

As you all where there to warn me for the Luna/UST saga. I am here to warn you not to follow everything Trump does blindly:

1. "People are buying "world liberty financial", trump's "defi" token on eth. The proceeds are getting converted to eth. But the token isn't transferable and the terms say it won't be for a minimum of a year and likely indefinitely. Don't touch it" - from another EVMaverick
2. "No information on this site is intended to be an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell any tokens where not permitted by applicable law." --> from below website 
3. The URL from their website is "token sale": [https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/intl/token-sale](https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/intl/token-sale) And the team literally consists of the people who will introduce the applicable law.
4. Insane grift lmao

Keep your ETH and ETH ico coins. You will be fine!  
Chase the good stuff. New Base/Warpcast projects, other L2s, projects with more innovation, public goods, etc.

We will win in the end!

The increasingly vocal demand for changes at EF are insanely bullish for me personally.    
    
It has been beyond frustrating to get bullied for YEARS by self-serving, fraudulent, venture capitalist liars like Kyle Samani so they could serve up their propogandized slop about how superior their centralized casino chains are. While EF leadership sits around and does NOTHING.   
    
I'm all for taking the high road against idiots but sometimes you have to fight. You can't soy your way into a financial revolution when grifting psychopaths are trying to crush you out of existence. It's time to be competitive and punch back. Fight for ideals and fight for what we've been building.    
    
So glad to FINALLY see this conversation happen.

<summary>u/haurog explains who Aya Miyaguchi is and her role at the EF after a question about her</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i4st8h/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2025/m7yrolh/)

Aya Miyaguchi took the executive directors position over from Ming Chan. Ming had the position since the launch of Ethereum in 2015 until 2017/2018. If you want to learn about a controversial executive director you can read up on Ming Chan and how most people felt about her. Nevertheless she was able to clean up the EF finances quite a bit and get some sorely needed structure into the foundation. When Aya took over pretty much everyone was releaved. With Aya internal power struggles seem to have calmed down massively, she was able to unite the pretty wide range of EF people under one vision which is honestly pretty impressive. She was an extremely good choice for that time period. That does not mean that I think she should stay at that position forever and personally there are very few people I respect more than Danny Ryan. When I heard him taking a break that was one of the sadder days for me. If we would get Danny at the helm of the EF I would be very happy, but at the same time I would keep my respect for what Aya managed to do within the EF.

Just to say, I am neither associated with the EF or met Ming Chan or Aya Miyaguchi personally. All my knowledge came from a handful of books written about the early Ethereum history and blog post from various people.

Why is X such a dramatic place? Looking at all the drama unfolding there. Yes, everyone is frustrated with the continuous ratio decline. Yes, competition is increasing (or at least the perception) and things need to change over time.¬†

But this straight on attack on the EF just over the last weeks as if they are fully responsibility for the decline. They are now seen as the scapegoat, whereas there are way more factors playing along.

On top of it, changes have been announced. Give it a couple of months to see if things have turned better. If not, you have a valid reason to further complain and RESPECTFULLY propose alternatives. However, the bullying as if Aya is the sole responsible person for one's ETH not being 5k, so they can cash out is just out of place.¬†

Because the algorithm is looking for and actively rewards maximum emotional outrage. You can argue it has increased since twitter has been sold, but this has always been there.  In my view most/all social media do this to a certain degree, because the emotional angle is the easiest one to capture people. 

Some people exploit this explicitly like: https://xcancel.com/MaxResnick1/status/1867238148842889511#m

while others are just swept along with the tides. 

This implicit optimization for outrage increases Key Performance Indicators for the social network in the short term, but destroys communities in the long term. 

This destruction of communities is what we have seen in the last half a year or year in Ethereum. As an outsider it is bewildering to see long term community members like Eric 'leaving' over something insignificant as who is ED in the Ethereum Foundation. Might very well be that he knows more than I do, but howdy does it look overblown from the sidelines. The same discussion style swept over from twitter and even long standing community members make statements here which are alienating, disrespectful and sometimes technically wrong.

<summary>u/Dreth is warning about possible sources of misinformation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i5kiod/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2025/m85um4u/)

There is an overwhelming amount of bullshit and misinformation on X aimed to attack the EF and Ethereum in general and I've always had a strong feeling that this is either partly or completely funded by 'competing' projects like Solana. There's a very strong financial incentive in trying to take away activity from ethereum, controlling your own validator set on your own blockchain, it's all taking sweet sweet retail money with no penalty and no likelihood of backfiring.

The misinformation campaign is absolutely massive, spans crypto newspapers like CoinDesk, lots of X accounts, mobs of bot-like users spewing bullshit, all to control the narrative that Solana is very much the thing that will replace Ethereum. As with every cycle, except this time with a lot _a lot_ more money.

Honestly a complete embarrassment for the industry. We saw this bullshit happen with EOS at a smaller scale in the 2017 bull market, then Solana, Terra/Luna, Avalanche and all the other horseshit chains with under 30 validators in 2021. Now again with Solana.

I hate sounding like a conspiracy theorist, but it is so obvious. Every time I take even 5 minutes of my valuable time to read some shitty article from any crypto newspaper there is some kind of diss at ethereum and some kind of praise at solana. Money has corrupted the industry just like it corrupted wall st. before the 2008 financial crisis. 

One day this industry will be large enough and this kind of crap will still be tolerated so much so to cause such a big reputational hit that we might take decades to recover from.

<summary>u/epic_trader explains Ethereum's issuance policy</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hxyrqi/daily_general_discussion_january_10_2025/m6fhihu/)

No, the idea isn't actually to be a deflationary currency.

Ethereum has always had a goal of reaching a "minimal viable issuance", but it's not exactly clear what that amounts to. It seems somewhat likely that Ethereum will make 1 more adjustment to the issuance model, but probably that will be the last change, if any is made.

Having the network issue ETH is what upholds the security of the network, this is how validators get paid. The fact that Bitcoin will stop issuing BTC is actually a huge potential problem because this is where miners get like 95% of their income from, the rest being from tx fees. So while it seems attractive to have 0 inflation on the surface, it's actually not a good design for the longterm. 

The reason why ETH is burned in the first place, is due to the tx gas fee market. By burning the transaction fees, it's impossible for stakers to send free transactions and manipulate the gas fee market or accept payments in other currencies. 

Right now there's a maximum possible theoretical issuance of around 1.5% annually, but that would require for every single ETH to be staked, and that's before considering the amount that gets burned.

The actual current level of inflation is around 0.9% with around 35 million ETH staked, before accounting for burned ETH. After accounting for ETH burned, the inflation is pretty close to 0%.

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth shares their thoughts on how L2s aren't parasitic to Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hzh55o/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2025/m6q2486/)

I think considering L2s parasites is a very superficial view of Ethereum. I understand why someone just looking at the price action might think that's the case. Ethereum is reinvesting its profits since 6-8 months ago, and it's not giving the speculators any big gains nor dividend ;)

If we've learned something these past few years is that you cannot have an expensive cryptocurrency and a thriving decentralized economy at the same time. This is a balance that needs to be achieved.

Before the ETH ticker rises, gas prices needs to go down massively. This is what blobs are achieving.

If L2s were paying the fees they used to pay back in the beginning of 2024, no one would complain about them being parasitic, but then Ethereum would still be mostly a 14 TPS L1 with serious scaling problems, and no one would use it. All will gravitate towards Solana and others.

The blob market is ridiculously cheap, and that is good. It's good because the amount of L2 activity keeps growing 30% monthly, and once blob fees from that increased activity start burning ETH at a decent pace, and once we get based rollups, there's really no stopping ETH.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i08e3q/daily_general_discussion_january_13_2025/m6yth0m/)

The fight against true decentralization is real and has increasingly been manifested through the constant and relentless coordinated attacks on ETH/Ethereum over the years. The current market (rising rates and fear of inflation etc.) are of course a key factor in the recent PA, but that combined with the negative sentiment artificially created only exacerbates downward pressure.

BTC is not a threat to USG anymore - it‚Äôs de facto controlled by it (miners are now large corporations mostly concentrated in the US and subject to strict regulatory compliance and Gvt oversight‚Ä¶and now so are holders via the likes of BlackRock and Microstrategy). You can almost trace the change in sentiment for ETH back to the day of the Merge. Moving away from PoW really pissed off someone off‚Ä¶ 

Alt1s are also de facto controlled by USG, with Silicon Valley VCs and limited nodes/validators mostly in the US, all regulated and subject to USG oversight.

It‚Äôs my biggest and single concern with ETH/Ethereum. It is too good at what it aims to be: a true instrument of change and decentralization. It is the most disruptive. The most cypherpunk. That‚Äôs what brought me to this space in the first place. The gains were just a reward for my conviction.  My hope is that this conviction, this cypherpunk ethos grabs hold of the narrative once again, otherwise it was all for naught.

Ps: you can replace USG by any nation state (or the ‚ÄúMan‚Äù), but USG controls the world‚Äôs financial system and thus is likely the main culprit.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i08e3q/daily_general_discussion_january_13_2025/m6wjz8o/)

Towards the end of last year, almost everyone seemed to be working on the assumption:

* Pump in first half of January, anticipation for pro-crypto Trump presidency
* Dump after inauguration, as expectation meets reality of not a lot actually happening (sell the news)

I think because that idea became so embedded into many peoples minds, a lot of peoples strategy had them selling in early January, during what they assumed would be a pump season. As markets often do, we are seeing the opposite to what was expected, as everyone tries to front run the expected post inauguration sell off, and is taking profits now "before it's too late", causing the current sell side pressure.

Since we are selling off now, I'd expect that means there is a chance this is the widely expected "sell off", and its just come early. In that case, sellers could actually be exhausting themselves already, and we may see the bottom out and turnaround faster than expected too. Sentiment already seems very bad, which is incredible given BTC still over $90k, and ETH still above $3k, a level it hasn't historically spent much time above. The longest time Ethereum spent over $3k USD was 15 weeks, in this current run we are on week 11.

If this is the expected sell off, I'd say everything is actually holding up remarkably well when measured against comparable sell offs in prior cycles. It's amazing how quickly people forget how painful these sell offs can be, and I'd still argue we are seeing far less pain than we experienced last cycle when we climbed the "wall of worry" in the early bull market.

All eyes are now on whether these $90k BTC and $3k ETH levels hold, which are likely to be seen as psychologically significant. This will tell us a lot about where we may be going next.

<summary>u/UgotTrisomy21 compares the cost of banks vs Ethereum for remittances</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i08e3q/daily_general_discussion_january_13_2025/m6yixki/)

I probably wasted my time in the r/investing subreddit trying to explain why stablecoin remittances are a huge use case that even crypto haters could appreciate (since many of them aren't aware of Ethereum/stablecoins and just associate crypto with "ponzi bitcoin" cause BTC has no utility), but I went through with it anyway doing a step by step write up (even logging into my bank account to simulate a wire transfer etc).

It actually even surprised me a bit to see how much cheaper it truly was. This is a usecase that every normie/crypto hater should be able to get behind, because they don't even have to ever buy/touch any crypto asset (ETH included) outside of stablecoins (which they won't even have to hold for longer than 1 minute between sending/swapping back to fiat) and they'd be able to greatly benefit from it in terms of fees saved.

See [my comment here](https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i000iv/comment/m6yde8d/) for the full writeup.

TLDR:

As of right now, a US person can pay 0.25 cents to send $5,000 USD to someone in Europe, who would then receive 4883 Euros after 1 day.

If that US person instead decides to send $5,000 USD via Chase Bank (just using the largest US bank as an example) to someone in Europe, they would only receive 4763 Euros after 1-3 days.

Sending stablecoins would be faster and save you 120 Euros in fees compared to the traditional banking route.

[u/j8jweb](https://reddit.com/u/j8jweb):

Since you‚Äôre here, I assume you think ETH is either 1) a superior (or comparable) investment to BTC; or 2) a long shot that‚Äôs worth a punt.

Which is it for most of you?

Do you genuinely think ETH will catch up with (or outperform) BTC this cycle as it has in all previous cycles? Or has the landscape shifted so much in the past 4 years that this is now highly improbable?

My patience has really been tested this cycle for some reason. Perhaps it‚Äôs because 6-figure BTC no longer feels remotely underpriced, and ETH is still ‚Äúdown here‚Äù near $3k, when it ought to be closer to $6k or $7k.

[u/TimbukNine](https://reddit.com/u/TimbukNine):

The Ethereum ecosystem and capability is clearly far superior to Bitcoin, so I‚Äôm in it for the very long term. 

That said, the sheer amount of money behind the industries supporting Bitcoin is vast and they have a vested interest in muddying the waters for anything that can be genuine competition. 

The big players employ teams of developers and marketeers who promote anything that can be hyped into a ‚ÄúBitcoin killer‚Äù or fast track to riches. This sucks investment away from actual threats who then find themselves floundering wondering why they aren‚Äôt getting anywhere while BTC continues to rise. The Bitcoin killers lose momentum when their owners pull the plug.

A small prediction: Solana will collapse in March this year under a huge sell off from their VC backers.

[u/nomadineurope](https://reddit.com/u/nomadineurope):

Neither.

I simply think it has become one of the most widespread - if not most widespread - chains.

It has the early comer's advantage plus significant momentum and I think the L2s have addressed a lot of the shortcomings such as high gas fees.

From a developer's perspective there is a huge ROI on learning Solidity and EVM. 

From a trader's perspective, I don't see ETH as appealing as, say BTC or the high volatility Solana coins.

[u/PhiMarHal](https://reddit.com/u/PhiMarHal):

Both but also a third one, the principle of asymmetry. The more undervalued ETH is, the greater the upside. Consensus investments make consensus money.

What's the path forward for btc? Shilled by president of the United States, propped up by the MSTR ponzi, the Tether ponzi. It's not as if bitcoin will become useful, and we'll eventually run out of greater fools. Miners still drain billions of dollars from their ecosystem. bitcoin still has no plan for economic security in the long run.

What's the path forward for ETH? Ethereum being actual tech that serves a purpose, it can very much scale to planetary needs and deliver a service the world is willing to pay a self-sustaining amount of fees for. We have contigencies for quantum computers and most other threat vectors.

The main risk for Ethereum is that somehow we never manage to communicate that value to the wider world and can't justify high valuation. This would be a bizarre outcome because we already see consistent growth in adoption. I think it's only likely through some weird "black swans". The AI Singularity happens for real and we all turn into space communists with one giant impartial computer to administrate us all, trust in this system is absolute and money becomes obsolete. Or, World War 3 nukes us back to Stone Age. That level of black swanning.

Any of those would kill bitcoin as well anyway. So the final equation is this: do I want more risk and less upside (btc), or less risk and more upside (ETH)?

I think bitcoin only makes sense as an investment for a pure mercenary who believes blockchain is a sham, or at least thinks it'll never live up to the promises; our merc wants to get out at the right time this cycle and kiss crypto goodbye. With that outlook perhaps one could bet on bitcoin. But even with that mindset, still feels like buying at the top of the pyramid. Good luck to the brave merc, me I find believing in something easier.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard tells us about the future of AI x crypto</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i1rwrc/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2025/m7ex102/)

Agents today are just a parlor trick of an open source model + some prompt engineering integrated with a Twitter bot. But AI agents can and *will* be so much more than that.

When we make fine-tuning as a service and build AVSs that offer this to end users affordably people will be able to build their own personalized models for anything they like. Make a model that grades your math homework and serves as your tutor. Make a model that diagnoses cancer from MRI scans. Make a model that knows all your preferences and offers recommendations for shows to watch, things to repurchase on your usage schedule, etc without being diverted to inferior products because that makes Amazon more money. Make a model that fights Ethereum FUD so you don't have to type out long replies as you engage with CT trolls for fun.

Eventually we'll attach something like Sentient.AI's billing approach to the model so they can be open sourced without forfeiting the revenue rights to the model indefinitely, then anyone will be able to host it for you for a negotiated revenue split. Then we can tokenize the model at the outset and reward those doing the training compute and those doing the data labeling by issuing them tokens that provide a claim upon the eventual revenue of the model. We'll wrap all of this in DePin so anyone can contribute compute to either train the model or host it on an inference market. We'll add TEE + snarks to prove the computation was done honestly. We'll attach TEE's+MPC to protect your privacy.

Lastly we'll make DAOs that govern the data set the model is trained on so we can have community run fine-tuned models that those communities can monetize at the inference layer rather than the output layer.

What you're seeing with AI agents now is overhyped. Using blockchains to organize efforts to create impactful fine-tuned models is underrated. Blockchains help us excel at human coordination. Crypto x AI is a more coordinated and hopefully value-aligned AI layer in the long term than is likely to be offered by for-profit companies.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i2jajk/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2025/m7hv43d/)

During todays all core devs call the timeline for the pectra fork has been discussed. The plan is to have the following schedule:

feb 3, publish new client releases for the upgrade by this date

~feb 12, sepolia fork

~feb 19, holesky fork

and if all works well we will get a mainnet fork in march

That sounds awesome. Looking forward to another great upgrade. 

Exact block numbers for the upgrade will be determined in the coming days.

Let me try to answer that:

- Double the amount of blob space. More rollups and cheaper transactions on them. Scaling that actually works.
- Reduction of the number of validators but still keeping the same network security. Ethereum needs fewer resources. Scaling L1 will get easier. Will take some time to play out.
- Account abstraction for your old addresses. Same convenience as smart contract accounts. Will take some time to play out.
- You can exit your validator from your withdrawal address. Makes LSTs much more trustless. 
- Increases costs for certain transaction types, which does not interfere with the normal user, but allows for a much more massive scaling of the L1.

<summary>u/benido2030 introduces r/Ethereum to the EthFinance community delegates</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1i2jajk/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2025/m7gds7e/)


If you scroll all the way down in the [Daily Doots you will find a "delegates" section](https://dailydoots.com/#delegates). Back in the [r/ethfinance](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/) days, we started organizing and coordinating as a (reddit) community because there were some initiatives where we agreed that some things should happen (e.g. when one non-censoring relay went offline because of the inability to monetize we agreed to get the Aestus relay some funding via OP grants) or should not happen (e.g. when LDO applied for the (I believe it was) STIP in the Arbitrum ecosystem we coordinated and agreed to voice our concerns about / and vote against them receiving ARB to even further increase their market share).

After that we thought we could take this even further and plan for new airdrops, find ethfinance delegates before TGE and delegate to community members when claiming was possible. This happened for e.g. Starknet, zksync and Scroll. There are many positive effects: You have a rather easy way to reach out to your delegate, either by tagging them or via DM. Delegates like [u/bob-rossi](https://reddit.com/user/bob-rossi/) have made regular governance updates to keep the community posted about proposals, discussions etc. in the different ecosystems. And if there are topics around an L2 or so, even without tagging, delegates will usually comment and share their thoughts and gather feedback if they are undecided.

Does this mean that after the merge all [r/ethereum](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/) members now should delegate to someone from the list? Of course not! You are free to choose any delegate, become a delegate and if you are a delegate I am sure we can add you to the list as well! But if you still have some L2 tokens (or even bought more in the past couple of months) and haven't delegated those yet, you might consider one of the people from the community.

And if you have questions, I am sure we can activate most delegates to do a quick intro, answer questions and share their idea about why they are (still) delegate.

money comes and goes but your time spent looking at candles never ever comes back

if you cannot handle that, best to invest in low risk assets

it's been a tough few years, have an entry and exit plan and learn to stomach drops, it's a skill that you need to invest in crypto

<summary>u/doublyrobustlydouble discusses what they see as Ethereum's primary value proposition</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hsgmtm/daily_general_discussion_january_03_2025/m58664s/)

Ethereum's main value proposition in my opinion is from securing the  information and value on its network.

The value part is obvious.  The ticker is ETH. ETH itself needs to be valuable in order to guarantee the continued functioning of the chain.  Without ETH value there will be no stakers, no block proposers, no block builders, no transactions, no chain.

The second piece is information.  ETH needs to be [expressive enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo&ab_channel=TechCrunch) to contain the various pieces of information that we find useful to put on-chain. Bitcoin is minimally expressive so it was highly limited in the amount of information it could store on-chain. Ethereum expanded the expressiveness to essentially infinity with a turing-complete programming language (Solidity) for smart contracts.

Now anyone can write any smart contract, put it onchain, and anyone in the world can instantly interact with that system.  I also believe that Ethereum has passed the bottleneck stage (for the most part) with fees such that it isn't too expensive to put information into the chain anymore.  [L2 tvl suggests so at least](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl).

Being able to rely on the chain, and the information stored on it, to persist into the future relies on the decentralization of the network.  The more decentralized it is the more likely it is to be resistant to attacks of all sorts, be it cultural/physical/financial.  Essentially it creates the most neutral credibility in terms of users being able to rely on it to function as intended.

Additionally, network effects exist all over the place for ETH.  Some examples:

1) mindshare and number of holders who are committed to the network and the ideas behind it rather than just trying to make a quick buck or scamming people 

2) Solo staker ecosystem which supports the foundational community which credibly runs the hardware that the Ethereum software controls, the source of ETH's credibility. 

3) Core dev commmunity. Required to improve and maintain the functioning of the Ethereum network.

4) Builder commnuity.  Improving solidity code, improving our understanding of how to implement the EVM every day, improving smart contract auditing and tooling.  

5) Smart contract network and liquidity.  The existing smart contracts that have been deployed are like the buildings in a city. If the core devs and solo stakers are the road/sidewalk builders transporting you around the system. The smart contracts and teams that have deployed them are the libraries, schools, offices, banks that you can interact with.  The more of these exist in a city the more vibrant the city becomes which is why people all clump together.  Same for smart contract network states.

There's more but that's just some examples.  

I'd like to propose another form of valuing Ethereum which is the amount of human "work" that it secures.  I think by this metric it shouuld be the most valueable asset on the planet bar none.  "But haven't lots of other companies spent 1000x more human hours?" Yes of course. However not all human hours can be counted the same.  Think about all the human hours that go into maintaining an exchange in traditional finance world.  It's huge.  Now you deploy [uniswap contract](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) which is a fancy version of x * y = k and viola, you have SOLVED exchanging tokens. Basically for all humans for all time.  I still don't think people understand HOW MUCH human effort smart contracts contain within them.  They are the most consolidated, most efficient, human effort in history.  They are the blueprint, the instructions, the software, that controls a fleet of hardware dispersed across the entire world, telling them exactly how to do operations that humans would otherwise have to spend countless hours doing manually.

The more that this system's functionality expands, the easier it gets to use. Network effects.  Eventually it will consume the majority of at least the digital world's activity.  You need ETH to operate this computer.  You don't have enough ETH.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hu02fw/daily_general_discussion_january_05_2025/m5ieeo8/)

See PFOF, dark pools, and how market makers work fundamentally by "providing liquidity".


PFOF does not require your purchases to go to "Lit" markets which would affect the price if they did.

Your purchases go to match in-house trades/bets or go to dark pools.

This is partially the reason why IEX "Lit" trading and direct registration of shares have exploded in popularity.

If you want a simple video on how this works, Jon Stewart does a decent job here:
<https://youtu.be/bP74RBTE8kI>

If you wish you can watch from 7:02 onwards to see a rough diagram of what I'm talking about.

Dark pools:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pool>

PFOF:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_for_order_flow>

When shares are registered in "Street name" they are registered with Cede & Co. which is DTC's nominee name. (Note that the DTCC is a private company and not a regulatory arm of the U.S. Government)
DTC is a subsidiary of the DTCC.

Brokers or other financial intermediaries maintain accounts with DTC.
The broker holds a sub-account at DTC reflecting its clients‚Äô aggregate holdings, but DTC does not track individual investor accounts.

While the shares are legally registered under the broker or DTC's nominee (Cede & Co.), the individual investor is the beneficial owner.
The broker keeps a record of which individual investor owns what, ensuring proper allocation of dividends, voting rights, and other benefits.

The DTCC board of directors is comprised of executives from the major U.S. banks and market makers:
<https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board>

Does PFOF breach bucketeering laws?

"They": Banks, market makers, exchanges, brokers, hedge funds, etc.

I would also argue that:

1. They make the laws/rules.
2. They follow the laws/rules when it's profitable to do so.
3. They have broken the laws/rules numerous times and are fined with a slap on the wrist from the SEC.

Here's a great one for Citadel Securities (Who have a spot on the board of the DTCC):

[u/Heringsalat100](https://reddit.com/u/Heringsalat100):

Many people seem to think that marketing Ethereum is only relevant for price but it isn't. Techies have to be aware that even pretty successful CEOs and politicians have no clue about blockchain technology, maybe not even a glimpse why decentralization matters. They are dependent on people, organizations and companies telling them which chain to choose.

If they are growing comfortable with using other chains than Ethereum because of marketing by these actors it is a net negative for Ethereum the network/project and not just the ETH price. It isn't a price pumping scheme but a basic necessity to educate normal but influential people with easy to remember and understand marketing buzzwords and campaigns.

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

Unpopular opinion: 

The Ethereum Foundation shouldn't do marketing.

While there have been many bad choices made by the EF over the years, I'm siding with them on this one. 

First off, marketing what?  There are 3 main things that could be marketed:

**1) Marketing ether the asset**

Marketing a token has a name: shilling, and the vast majority of crypto shilling is done by scams. Even most alt-l1s don't openly suggest buying their tokens. 

Also keep in mind that the EF needs to sell eth to fund development. 

Shilling eth while selling it at the same time would probably be one of the easiest way to lose credibility to institutions. Clearly a bad idea.

**2) Marketing Ethereum the network for adoption**

Competitors are very active in this, constantly pushing for adoption, probably often paying for it through artificial partnerships. 

The obvious problem here is that we're barely able to accommodate our existing demand:

Ethereum L1 still can only process 12-15tps on average and is very easy to saturate, making the network unusable for most use cases. 

Existing L2s already put blobs at target value. You might say that target will double with Pectra within a couple of months, but remember that Sony's, Kraken's, and Deutsche Bank's rollups aren't even live yet. 

Do you really want to promote Ethereum to institutions for them to build on it, to then see them fail at launching their products because the network is saturated?

Not only have many institutions already started building on Ethereum by themselves, but it's also still too early to try to onboard the entire world. Our time will come soon enough.

**3) Marketing Ethereum's values**

This point is probably the most debatable of the 3. 

It would indeed be great if the world saw the value of decentralization and censorship resistance. But based on current metrics, it seems like this is already fairly well understood:

\- It's no coincidence if the 2 most valuable blockchains are the 2 most decentralized.

\- It's no coincidence if Ethereum managed to remain home to [55% of the stablecoin market](https://defillama.com/stablecoins/chains), [78% of RWAs](https://app.rwa.xyz/), and [55% of defi TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), after years of insanely expensive transaction fees. 

\- It's no coincidence if Ethereum has [all this crazy institutional adoption](https://ethereumadoption.com/).

Truth be told I think Ethereum doesn't need marketing. The network effect is already past escape velocity. We have barely started to enjoy the benefits of the rollup centric roadmap. 

The future of marketing will be done by institutional L2s, when they'll promote their services to their userbases. Just like Coinbase already does with Base, by adding [7 million weekly active addresses](https://www.growthepie.xyz/) to the ecosystem. 

What do you think Kraken, Sony and Deutsche Bank will do after they launch their rollups? 

Market it to millions of their users.

Do you think all institutions building on Ethereum have made it public yet? 

Fuck no, there are probably dozens of rollups being developed by big brands today, waiting to be announced to keep a competitive edge. And after launching, they'll market their services to their users.

The recent push for marketing by the EF is mostly driven by impatience with price performance.

But I happen to believe that it won't be long for this problem to be solved as well.

-----

Just some stream of thought...

Octant deserves to be mentioned along with the heavy hitters but they've been on a perpetual 90 day Epoch cycle and I couldn't find an end of year recap. Money talks and their staking yield is massive. [Octant v2](https://octantapp.notion.site/Degens-Dragons-Octant-V2-Overview-full-version-0-4-127e165689aa8022bb01dfc76e3cca4d) looks like an awesome iteration.

I'm sure it is popping most places and but kinda feels like Optimism is the main layer 2 hub for public goods funding and think what they're doing with retro and metrics based funding is super interesting. Celo is really focused on ReFi and Arbitrum has been making a big push. Maybe anecdotal, but I'd be curious what others are seeing. Bummer that Public Goods Network didn't work out. Might have been timing/execution more than a flawed concept but who knows. 

The regen space is still maturing but pretty pumped about the broad embrace of collaboration and increasing focus on impact measurement/standards and capital formation/allocation experimentation. So many other regen/education based organizations and projects that are all pieces of the puzzle. Funding the Commons, VDAO, Regens Unite, Bloom Network, 2077,  Atlantis P2P, Noun-ish communities and VRBS and flows.wtf, Kolektivo, Crypto Altruism, Breadchain, Climate Coordination Network, Ma Earth, Blockchain for Good Alliance, Public Goods Club etc and DeSci is out of scope for me but everything happening over there...Glo Dollar and other mechanisms like lotto pgf, Flow State and this streaming qf wave, Grant Ships, futarchy, so much shit happening.

Bunch of Greenpill Chapters/Guilds and ReFi DAO Local Nodes are absolutely killing it. Have spent most of my time the last year with Greenpill Network, Dev Guild, and Writers Guild. Still have a lot of furniture to move around, infrastructure to develop and operational mechanisms to polish within Greenpill but 2025 we're really leaning into the [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/Regen-Coordination-Hub-11a2e7251f2f8091bcc9fd0caf288e72) which was established in 2024 with ReFi DAO and CeloPG, but Let's GROW dao and probably some others deserve props for really amplifying and contributing to the cause. In 2024 had a round for the organizations, one for individuals, Bioregional Finance, and Agroforestry DAO. 

Some top of mind real world impact tools: Impact Miner, Gain Forest, Restor, EthicsHub, Helios, SolarPunkDAO, Green Goods, Silvi, Kokonut Network, Treegens, etc. 

So many coordination/governance/impact measurement tools being built like EAS, Guild.xyz, RnDAO, TogetherCrew, Gardens, KarmaGAP, Coordinape, Open Civics, Endaoment, Hypercerts, Open Source Observer, Commons Stack.

Trying to post more often without overthinking it. Would love to see more public goods funding content here. Really is important for Ethereum's sustainability, culture and competitive advantage. There's a huge demand for better marketing of Ethereum and I think the regen/pgf space is gold in that department.

Except from u/hedgemagus on [another thread](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hx76vn/comment/m692t97/). Context is they want to contribute to promoting Ethereum but don't know how.

>its something I want to work on, I feel like if I'm the one throwing this out there its not right that I dont do my part. Im just not sure what my best offer to fixing this is yet.

You don't need to be a genius to contribute in meaningful ways. For example I created [https://ethereumadoption.com/](https://ethereumadoption.com/) b/c I saw there was a gap in what was happening vs people's perception. My first iteration of this was just a markdown file with a list of links. Didn't know how to create a website or manage a server, it was just a markdown file hosted as a static site.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains how tokens are going to eat TradFi</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hx76vn/daily_general_discussion_january_09_2025/m6b1wox/)

The Mutual Fund celebrated its centennial last year. These were the crown jewel of fintech in their day and they predate the SEC which is a good reminder that fintech innovation was entirely possible before the SEC graciously stepped in to protect all of us. Mutual funds gave investors price exposure to an entire sector through a simple passive investment. It's an early example of using the same bookkeeping system we use for ownership of companies for more abstract financial intentions.

Then in the 1990s Tradfi invented ETFs. These were more tax efficient than mutual funds because buyers could treat income as capital gains and redeem the shares for in-kind assets (which avoids a trade) but most importantly they were natively tradable on the stock exchange throughout the day rather than indirectly through the fund company or brokers after market close. Taxes deferred allow you to compound more money before eventually cashing out. Paying a lower tax rate effectively increases your yield compared to dividends. Fairer redemptions protects the peg and leads to a healthier asset for buyers. The benefits of these changes are undeniable and due to them ETFs have experienced explosive growth.

Since their inception ETFs have been gobbling up an ever larger share of the economy. In the early 1990s at the advent of the ETF, mutual funds accounted for around 20% of the NYSE total market cap. Today, mutual funds and ETFs together account for around 40%. This is in addition to the market cap rising from 36.7% of US GDP to a staggering 208%. This shows just how much fundamental value there is to a financial wrapper around even the simplest financial intent (a basket of assets).

But the blockchain is doing much more than acting simply as a ledger at this point. It does more than transfer value; it adds value by enabling you to express financial intentions. Today you can capture financial upside from any type of price movement you like. There are ways to profit from the price going up, down, sideways, or just being volatile. Defi has already rebuilt most of Tradfi on more technically sound infrastructure backed by more math and less counterparties. This covers everything from [decentralized exchanges](https://defillama.com/dexs), to [rate-stripping protocols](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms), to options protocols and even some entirely new things like [prediction markets](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html), [leveraged carry trades](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads), and a fully [internet native bond](https://mirror.xyz/0xF99d0E4E3435cc9C9868D1C6274DfaB3e2721341/v_ksCJPHOLFOtXB47ng7cdYnFiVOq2pw22clQJq8weU).

Wrapping these financial intents in tokens offers the same benefits ETFs brought to the stock market but once you combine those benefits with the power of finalization you achieve self-compounding, yield-bearing, leveraged strategies underpinning the token that anyone, anywhere in the world can access with nothing more than a swap or deposit. You no longer have to resort to something like [this](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris). Uniswap v1 didn't return a token. Uniswap v2 did; and I attribute this simple fact to its dominance today. The simple act of creating a token for each LP enabled the liquidity farming boom of 2020.  In Tradfi when you wrap these things with their own identifier and make them tradable they call it a Structured Product. In Defi, we call it a token. In the same way ETFs are eating the stock market, [tokens are going to eat Tradfi](https://youtu.be/HTveRlW7QPo?si=8b73P7RkTZGvwu7d&t=160). Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees, this is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.

<summary>u/MinimalGravitas covers a declaration of digital rights post that they saw</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hx76vn/daily_general_discussion_january_09_2025/m6anrz1/)

This isn't strictly an Ethereum or even crypto thing, but it is an example of the cypherpunk values that are probably a large part of what attracted many of us here in the first place:

<https://x.com/DesignItForUs/status/1877014902315086122>

A Declaration of Digital Rights, put together by a group of young people to address the real dangers and risks of the online world that is being built for them. Below are a selection of 5 out of their 12 points that particularly resonate with me, but to be honest they are all good, I just don't want to rob them of clicks by sharing them all here. 

If these are values you want to support, then I would suggest you like or share their tweet to help encourage these views.

* **Right to privacy:** Social media platforms collect endless amounts of data on us. Young people have the right to scroll without Big Tech listening to them on every corner of the internet and selling off that data to the highest bidder. Companies should be responsible for designing social media and AI products that consistently protect and preserve our personal data. Privacy must come before profit.

* **Right to user controls:** Suggested posts in feed, new shop features, algorithms, endless scrolling, and never-ending push notifications. Whether you like them or hate them, young people have the right to switch the most harmful features on or off, whenever we choose.

* **Right to delete:** As consumers of digital products, young people have a right to permanently delete our own content and leave social media platforms that are not working for us. Social media platforms should uphold that right, delete our information, and leave us alone. The right to our personal information is solely ours, not social media companies‚Äô.

* **Right to transparency:** Big Tech has thrived off of the presumption that they are above the law. They leverage their power as private companies to profit from our pain, by design, while shielding themselves in opacity. Like any other public goods, we as consumers have a right to fair and transparent products that are responsible to the user and the law, not the shareholders nor the CEOs. 

* **Right to be protected from manipulation:** Like never before, Big Tech has relentlessly leveraged innovation against the best interests of users, manipulating our data and weaponizing our well being against us. Instead of crafting design features meant to support healthy engagement, Big Tech companies have wielded their unchecked power to addict us and harm us while publicly saying otherwise. We have a right to be shielded from these insidious patterns of abuse.

Disclaimer: None - I've never asked anyone here to share anything or do anything before, and I am in no way affiliated with this group (hadn't heard of them until just now), but I strongly feel like I should support potential allies if they advocate for values I share.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hro11y/daily_general_discussion_january_02_2025/m51ynb2/)

#Daily DevCon #32:

[Redefining boundaries in the Infinite Garden ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE15rsPVHz0)

It's Thursday, January 02, 2025 ‚Äî day 32 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.

##Summary:

The speaker highlighted the key advancements in Ethereum, such as reduced energy consumption post-merge, more than 99.9% scaling solutions, and cheaper/faster transactions on layer twos. They emphasized Ethereum's readiness for long-term development based on values of credibility, neutrality, open source, participation, and decentralization. The talk drew parallels to Southeast Asian governance structures and emphasized the importance of nurturing a diverse ecosystem with shared values for long-lasting resilience, likening it to a garden where various circles coexist and collaborate rather than one dominating force, fostering innovation and sustainability in the Ethereum community.

##Discussion Questions:

How can the values of credibility, neutrality, open source, participation, and decentralization in Ethereum contribute to its long-term development and sustainability in the blockchain space?

In what ways can fostering a diverse ecosystem with shared values be a driving force behind innovation and resilience in the Ethereum community, similar to the concept of various circles coexisting in a garden?

We haven't reached $7500 in 2024 based on my local time zone, Berlin Time, here in Germany. For [this reason I am gonna eat a darjeeling tea bag as I have stated](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/s/GVeq28S41C).

I have agreed with u/majorpickle01 that I am gonna provide a logbook of my experience! (photos/videos are too risky because of doxxing)

And you know what it is here at the moment? 16:05 and thus ... TEA TIME! I am gonna provide the logbook as continuous edits for now.

- 16:07: Water is boiling, preparing tea bag and cup
- 16:09: Put hot water in tea cup with bag; waiting 3 minutes for steeping
- 16:13: Put tea bag out of cup and on a plate; let it cool down for now (too hot to eat it)
- 16:15: tea bag still too hot, waiting
- 16:17: tea bag temperature good; trying to chew on it
- 16:18: Oh dear, the bitterness; the bag material is very fibery; Trying to chew more with front teeth
- 16:20: part of tea bag in my mouth; still chewing on the fibery outer material; the tea itself isn't bad, though! Even though slightly bitter but better than first contact
- 16:22: Managed to disintegrate the majority of the fibrous stuff in my mouth, swallowed it. Doesn't really feel like paper ... something different ... something more fibrous
- 16:24: got the second piece into my mouth, the same procedure as a couple of minutes ago!
- 16:26: There seems to be a thicker part of the outer tea bag material, too thick to chew it. Have to be honest: put it out of my mouth to avoid health risks. (sry. for that)
- 16:28: Chewing on third piece
- 16:29: That one was easier, swallowed it
- 16:30: nipping the tea I got to prepare for last piece
- 16:31: final piece!
- 16:32: I was able to train this three times in a row now! Swallowed the last part!

The only part which is left is completely without tea so I guess I attended to my duty!

Happy holidays EthFam, hope you've all been enjoying stuffing yourselves with quantities of mincepies and Baileys that you will regret upon eventually sobering up.

Just wanted to touch base in one of the final few EthFinance Dailys to say that it honestly has been a gift to have shared the Ethereum journey with you here for the last few years.

I have never found an open online community that has been so wholesome, enjoyable and rewarding to be a part of, especially in crypto where seemingly every other space becomes a zero-sum game of fake hype, manipulation and general nonsense, EthFinance has been a beacon of sanity and good conversation.

I am excited for the next steps as we move to our new home, and shepherded by the best mod team on Reddit, bring our special something to the wider Ethereum community.

Long live EthFinance.

<https://ethereumadoption.com/>

Just take a minute to look at this. 

I remember coming to the Ethereum reddits 8 years ago and back then we were dreaming about what is a reality today. 

The reality now is that everyone that sees the potential of blockchain and is taking it seriously is building things on Ethereum, which is making more and more people see it's potential. 
It is absolutely amazing to see this unfold right before our eyes. 
The list will keep on growing of who is building on Ethereum. 

Becides the success of updates, developers, applications, Dapps, tvl, investments, scaling,... You can see the trend of more and more coming in. 
- More and more institutions/banks launching tokenized funds, 
- More and more creating layer2's to be able to build on Ethereum through scaling,
- More and more are seeing the value of Ethereum with the decentralization and security it provides. 

When you take a second to see the trend and the direction everything is going, the conclusion is that the future of Ethereum is very very promising. 

The ticker is ETH. Happy new year everyone.

<summary>u/unthinkablecryto starts a discussion about crypto tax accounting software</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hpgla2/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2024/m4kucpx/)

Posting in both dailies. 

What site is everyone in the US using to generate their safe harbor plan / transition plan / or digital asset allocation plan?
   
Looks like CryptoTaxGirl and CryptoTaxAudit (any better ones out there?) have forms you can have fill out. Seems like the three things you need to do before the 1st is, 1) document holdings across all wallets 2) choose between Specific Unit Allocation (if able) or Global Allocation 3) If global allocation, choose method, Highest Cost Allocated First, or Lowest Cost Allocated First, or Oldest Allocated First. 
   
Seems like Specific Unit Allocation is more complex and both forms are for Global Allocation, which allow you to allocate for example the highest cost allocated first, CryptoTaxGirl says "This method would allocate everything you owned you before 1/1/25 in order from highest cost to lowest cost. The highest-cost lots would be allocated first to your assets on hosted wallets then to your unhosted wallets in order of acquisition date, from oldest to newest. This means starting in 2025, when the default accounting method switches to First-in-first-out (FIFO), your sells,trades, spends, or transfer of assets owned before 1/1/25 will pull from your highest cost units allocated to each wallet and exchange. This approach will generally result in deferring gains and accelerating losses."
   
CryptoTaxAudit doesn't seem to have a spot for step 3. And it doesn't seem like you need to assign your cost basis before the 1st but you need to before your first buy or sell in 2025.

#Daily DevCon #29:

[Evolution of Scams ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgkEwSDkBnI)

It's Monday, December 30, 2024 ‚Äî day 29 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.

##Summary:

The speaker discussed the evolution of scams in the crypto space, focusing on end users. They covered various scam methodologies such as seed phishing, money doubling schemes, and drainer kits that exploit open approvals to drain assets. Monkey drainer, Inferno drainer, and Angel drainer are examples of prevalent kits that have targeted users. The talk emphasized the importance of transaction simulation to educate users about the implications of their actions on the blockchain. Additionally, the speaker highlighted the sophistication of current malicious techniques and the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between attackers and security measures, with a focus on enhancing detection methods for malicious transactions.

##Discussion Questions:

1. How can the Ethereum community work together to increase awareness among users about the various scam methodologies in the crypto space and empower them to make informed decisions while engaging in transactions on the blockchain?

2. In what ways can advancements in transaction simulation tools be utilized to enhance user education and prevent falling victim to sophisticated malicious techniques targeting end users in the crypto space?

<summary>u/interweaver explains how the new US tax laws might affect you and u/crumbumcrumbum also has US tax PSA</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hq8bu0/daily_general_discussion_december_31_2024/m4oph6r/)

[u/interweaver](https://reddit.com/u/interweaver):

If you were already tracking your cost basis on a per-lot basis (e.g. for Specific Lot, FIFO, or LIFO tracking) then this shouldn't change anything for you; you already have all the info you need. Same if you were not tracking specific lots, but were tracking at a wallet level (e.g. every time assets enter or leave the wallet, you recalculate the average cost basis for that asset in that wallet, distinct from other wallets' cost bases for that asset) - just keep doing that.

If you were tracking your cost basis for assets globally, by recalculating the global cost basis for that asset regardless of where you held it, every time you acquired more of it, regardless of which wallet/account it was in, then you will need to improve your tracking to either of the two more fine-grained levels of tracking mentioned above.

For stakers, tbh you really should have already been tracking at a per-wallet or ideally specific-lot level, if only to keep Eth with long-term capital gain status separate from Eth held for less than a year. But if you were lazy with your tracking, you will need to up your game. There shouldn't be any real staking-specific gotchas there - validators should each be considered wallets, e.g. the Eth in them should each have its own cost basis that you track separately (or even the specific lots of Eth within it), and every time you receive a withdrawal or fee from a proposal, you need to either add a new specific lot to the withdrawal/fee recipient wallet with that day's cost basis, or update the average cost basis for that wallet.

Overall this is a pretty reasonable change; the only people affected are those who were taking what I would personally consider to be somewhat inadvisable shortcuts with their accounting, and it just forces them to be more fine-grained.

Note that I'm pretty sure there's a safe haven rule where you can take the cost basis of your wallets as of January 1st (tomorrow) as a starting point; they won't force you to retroactively recalculate all your cost bases, just to track it going forward in the new year.

[u/crumbumcrumbum](https://reddit.com/u/crumbumcrumbum):

Long Boring (unless you're a tax nerd like me) US Tax PSA: 

IRS crypto cost basis rules are changing in 2025 away from universal cost basis to per-wallet. While I haven't quite worked through all the implications, you can help future you by doing two things: 

1  take a snapshot of your holdings as of January 1 so you can allocate your cost basis under the safe harbor rule.
1 choose and record your plan for allocating cost basis before the new year. There's no official way to do this, but various crypto tax sites gave templates. 

I like [Crypto Tax Girl](https://cryptotaxgirl.com/blog/understanding-the-safe-harbor-plan-rev-proc-2024-28-and-2025-crypto-tax-reporting-updates/) for a breakdown of some of this and a template to record your plan.

I've missed conversations about this if they've happened in Ethfinance before. While the new rules seem like they will add complexity, I wonder if the new rules might actually simplify specific identification methods, since you can move the specific coins with your desired cost basis to a hot wallet to sell. My accounting software (Tokentax) does give me info on specific tax lots, but does not tell me which wallet each lot is in. If it did, it would make things easier.

TokenTax support says they're waiting for more clarity on how the IRS will implement safe harbor rules before building it into their system - though it would be helpful to know the tax implications of trades that happen starting tomorrow. The simplest thing to do, of course, is to consolidate into one wallet today, but there are plenty of reasons not to do that for security, accounting, convenience, etc.

TLDR: if you have more than one wallet, snapshot your holdings tomorrow to possibly save yourself some accounting headaches

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard compares blockchain superpowers over TradFi</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hq99kz/daily_general_discussion_december_31_2024/m4rvxni/)

When we first fractionalized the ownership of institutions or companies we gave them a label, units we called shares, and we made them transferrable in a basic way with double entry bookkeeping on paper ledgers that we made copies of around the world and which people notarized the authenticity of. The basic underpinning of stocks hasn't changed much since the first iteration. Granted, we've digitized it and made it accessible to a wider audience, but the digital systems of today have essentially replicated these initial paper systems and inherited most of their flaws. So today I'll be writing about some of these flaws, the inherent benefits of blockchains in solving them, what we have built today, and what is coming next next in the evolution of ownership and financial intents.

Today we live with a stock market with T+1 settlement which basically means it isn't even known who owns what at any given time. We live with a system with trusted counterparties where naked shorting (despite being illegal) regularly happens. We live with a system that happens to shut down whenever it isn't a convenient time in New York City despite serving users globally. That's before we even touch some of the more egregious abuses of power like Robinhood famously disabling the buy button on a certain stock when a bull run was inconveniencing some powerful people.

One of the most amazing superpowers that blockchains have offered the world is one that we don't even talk about except in the most technical sense: finality. Fundamentally a blockchain is just a consensus machine that outputs a time-series of events that we can prove the authenticity of. Practically, what this amounts to is a *basically* incorruptible ledger about anything you like that anyone in the world can access and trust. Finality means that we know who owns what and that once we know this it isn't subject to change in the future except by the consent of the owner. It's a guarantee that you can build upon in a non-fragile way.

Tradfi has only ever managed to create the illusion of this. They only ever figure out who owns all of a stock retrospectively. A court can always undo a transaction or counterparties involved in a transaction can fail to deliver. Anytime you get an instant confirmation of a trade from a web2 app that confirmation isn't *real*; it's only an optimistic estimate backed by the trusted relationships of a bunch of institutions you have no direct relationship with, didn't knowingly consent to use, and which could misbehave at any time.

The difference between a web2 confirmation and a web3 confirmation is an entire court system. The rights carried with the ownership of the asset in web2 are *extrinsic* to the asset. If the bank wrongly forecloses on your home you are entirely out of a home until you take them to court, prove it was wrongly seized from you, and have the courts enforce your rights. That not only comes at a high cost, but also no guarantees. The financial system today has to not only pay the cost of various middlemen but also underwrite the execution and enforcement risk of every legal obligation we delegate to them. There are also of course countless examples where someone was legally in the right but lost in the court system to someone who was better financed.

Contrast this to Defi. In Defi a lending protocol can receive an asset and generate a loan for you instantaneously. It doesn't need a court system to adjudicate the possibility that you didn't own the asset you deposited, that a bankruptcy proceeding a month later from some company you received the asset from might claw back the asset from you, or that the asset has been pledged as collateral multiple times. It has a rock solid guarantee that the transfer of a token means that you and *only you* had legal possession of the token. Because there's nothing to adjudicate with a court system a smart contract can function without having to know where you are in the world so it can pursue legal action against you in your local court of law. Also, unlike Tradfi where there is a byzantine maze of laws for intersecting jurisdictions, smart contracts work the same way for everyone everywhere in the world. Just imagine how many lawyer hours will be avoided by this simple fact. This is a multi-trillion dollar value-add to the world.

<summary>u/austonst inspires us to cultivate what we want to see in r/Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hq8bu0/daily_general_discussion_december_31_2024/m4t1l1o/)

Thanks for everything, r/ethfinance. The new year is traditionally a time for looking ahead and deciding how we want to conduct ourselves in the upcoming year. Through resolutions or just self-reflection, it's a good time to dream about what we want to do with our time and who we want to be.

With this community, we're simultaneously getting a more literal fresh start. An even clearer opportunity to build a sense of who we want to be, from the ground up. There's no better time to start contributing the kind of content you want our new r/ethereum home to show off to the rest of the world.

Let's build a home with the best blockchain discussion on the Internet: technically detailed but accessible to a broad audience. Let's use our position on the more prominent subreddit to welcome curious visitors, competently answer good-faith questions, be humble and open-minded about Ethereum's weaknesses, and demonstrate intellectual curiosity about the broader blockchain space while establishing healthy policies WRT concern trolls.

Let's establish a culture that encourages readers to participate, discuss their experiences, and share their knowledge. Whether it's someone's first DEX trade, or they just took a few hours to read through the documentation for a new identity protocol, or they want to express a controversial opinion on a new EIP, everyone should feel welcome and encouraged to write up their thoughts.

There is no better time to start a new regular post series about something you care about. Give us monthly updates on the governance activity in your favorite DAO, or try syncing one new EL client every week and share some impressions and metrics. Spy on the Solana subs and each day tell us what's on their minds, I dunno.

Let's make r/ethereum great. Happy New Year.

Happy new year.

Good post to start off the year - Vitalik on X to Elon Musk.

‚ÄúI admire your willingness to stand up and fight for freer movement of people, it‚Äôs an important freedom that all too easily gets thrown under the busd

That said I think it‚Äôs valuable to turn down the temperature here, on both tone of discourse and the social media banhammer.

Respecting free speech is easy when we agree with the speech, and hard when we think it‚Äôs awful. But the arguments for respecting free speech anyway are the same as ever: the banhammer is controlled by one group today, it will be controlled by another group tomorrow, and every use of it legitimizes further use, and by the end public discourse collapses into either balkanization, monoculture (where the winner will be the guy with the biggest hammer, not the guy with the best arguments) or constant war of all against all.

And it‚Äôs worth reflecting on just how much tone of discourse has fallen here over the past couple of years. I feel like a lot of people have been okay with rising aggressiveness because the target of the aggressiveness was one faction that they disliked, but once that beast is summoned, its nature is to look for new targets, and even if you approve of the first target you may not approve of the second or the third or the fourth - as many people have been finding out this week. Literally ‚Äúfirst they came for the communists, and I did not speak out because I was not a communist‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt the kind of memetic beast we want running the show when we‚Äôre entering an era of dangerous global political competition and rapidly improving AI.

The role of leaders in setting the tone is really important, and can be used to great good or great evil. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwartime mode‚Äù that will get humanity to Mars in one piece, it‚Äôs something brighter - and we should get into that mode today.‚Äù

<summary>u/ProfStrangelove investigates whether or not MSTR is a pseudo ponzi scheme and u/Dreth also shares his thoughts</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hgv892/daily_general_discussion_december_18_2024/m2mrhh2/)

[u/ProfStrangelove](https://reddit.com/u/ProfStrangelove):

So yesterday I had some questions regarding Microstrategy...

Since I wanted to understand better what they are doing I looked a little bit further into it.

Anyways, like was suspected yesterday, they are raising money through convertible bonds - so if they can't pay back the bond they issue new stocks to cover the debt - as far as I understand the stock price at which the bond converts is set at the beginning of the loan...  
There are also funds that specialize in convertible bonds - normally they buy those bonds AND short the stock as a hedge. So if the company goes belly up they still get some of its equity for the shares they hold but also have made money on the short.

There is a video by Martin Shkreli (yes that guy, I know I am not a fan but whatever) where he goes over MSTRs valuation

[https://youtu.be/7zaEJ6MutdU?t=490](https://youtu.be/7zaEJ6MutdU?t=490)  
(Timestamp is where he starts getting into it, before he pretty much just gathered info from financial statements)

Anyways Shkreli more or less also comes to the conclusion that this seems like a ponzi like scheme.  
Also the amount of additional money Saylor would need to raise in the future might become a problem because the convertible bond market isn't \*that\* huge...

Microstrategy is also doing some shitty "advertising" calling what they are doing "smart leverage" which is pretty much bs.  
Here is another video which goes into why Saylors strategy is pretty much like a pyramid scheme  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5LKZ1-6BWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5LKZ1-6BWM)

\*Edit\*   
Ah and another take away by Shkreli was the same as I had yesterday:  
Long Bitcoin, short Microstrategy should be free money if done at the right ratio - and one would need to "delta hedge" as the price moves...  
Anways I won't be doing that and just stick to holding ETH :D

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hgv892/daily_general_discussion_december_18_2024/m2mx1is/)

[u/Dreth](https://reddit.com/u/Dreth):

From a functional perspective it has most of the relevant characteristics of a ponzi scheme but there are indeed assets backing MSTR stock, the valuation is about 30-40% the price of BTC and the rest is the expectation that saylor can continue to do this + the negligible other business that MSTR has.

My perspective here is that it's pretty simple, there's is demand to obtain exposure to BTC through MSTR, and this is the exclusively relevant bit that could justify this premium. Maybe (idk) those individuals or entities traditionally couldn't hold BTC in their balance sheet, so they instead opted to gain exposure to BTC through MSTR stock.

On a ponzi scheme more and more assets are required to keep it going. In the case of Saylor, this structured trade has been ongoing for quite a long time, MSTR has held BTC through bear periods in deep deep loss. For the trade to survive, no more assets were required through the bear without needing to be unwound.

Is Saylor deceiving his investors and creditors? probably, we can assume that there potentially exists some information asymmetry between what we know and what his creditors _think_ they know. However, as long as the price of BTC holds up and MSTR isn't much more leveraged than 3x (assuming the rest of the business is worthless) there's a low risk for this trade to unwind, especially considering that until the bonds expire, we probably have very little to worry about.

Monitoring the valuation of this stock should be extremely important for us to determine how much risk Saylor is undertaking. 

IMO the biggest concern to me is that it's not just MSTR doing this anymore. Other BTC-related companies have followed MSTR's path and taken on similar debt to do the same thing and their stocks have soared. My guess is that the market perceives this sort of purchase of BTC with debt as low risk and therefore considers that when these companies take that risk, they're probably going to be doing well in the long run because BTC is expected to continue to go up.

The real mystery to me is what will happen if there is some kind of big flash crash? Saylor has kept the price high by continuing to make enormous purchased. Therefore we could question if demand for BTC artificially inflated by this or if there really is demand to continue to hold up the price of BTC irrespective of the fact that Saylor will continue to buy.

Idk, I also fully expect big short sellers to mount shorts on both BTC and MSTR to intentionally drive MSTR underwater. Right now MSTR is well in profit because their cost basis is 50-60k.

<summary>u/SpontaneousDream is dreaming about the next market hybrid</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hj3mq7/comment/m35uazi/)

Mods if this is too far off topic, please remove. I don't think it is given the direction ties to ETH and crypto as a whole.

I am bullish AF on (imo) the soon-to-be world's next major stock/crypto hybrid. It is none other than $coin. Okay, okay, hear me out:

1. In 2025, Coinbase will utilize its L2, Base, to either tokenize its stock for more exposure to liquidity (more inflows). Imagine using BTC or ETH to buy a truly tokenized version of $coin directly...or, Coinbase could use Base to provide dividends to $coin holders, possibly in the form of some scheduled airdrop.
2. $coin will enter s&p next year, which guarantees many millions in inflows (and also gives crypto exposure to virtually all investors). Bitwise has made this prediction as well in their [recent ](https://bitwiseinvestments.com/crypto-market-insights/the-year-ahead-10-crypto-predictions-for-2025)report.
3. Coinbase has been doing an insane amount of volume. [See overview here.](https://investor.coinbase.com/home/default.aspx) The next earnings report is going to kick ass.

Personally, I think it's a great beta play to btc, eth, and crypto as a whole. I think the market is totally undervaluing the impact of Base on Coinbase revenues and more importantly, *opportunities*, as a company. There are so may ways they can utilize their L2 to drive growth and earnings for the company, and that goes straight back to $coin holders. Yes, Base stats are still small compared to Coinbase as a whole company, but Base's stats having been going wayyyy up this year and most recently. TVL, transactions, developers, volume, commits, etc. [Full stats here for Base. ](https://defillama.com/chain/Base)

I am going low leverage to slowly continue building my position, with ETH as the collateral. LFG.

<summary>u/haurog reviews the Trezor Safe 3</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hkhgfo/daily_general_discussion_december_23_2024/m3hxws7/)

A few days ago I mention that I just bought a trezor safe 3 to transition away from my dying Ledger Nano S: https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hembku/daily_general_discussion_december_15_2024/m27cc3h/

A few people were interesting in my first impressions so here they are.

TLDR: The trezor safe 3 is a great replacement for my Ledger Nano S.

I went with Trezor because I am an open source maxi and now that the newer trezors (safe 3 and safe 5) also use a secure element chip there is nothing stopping me going there. Trezor has been in the space for a very long time so I assume they know what they are doing. As I was not sure how well it will work with my setup I went with the cheaper option (Trezor Safe 3) instead of the more expensive one (Trezor Safe 5). Security wise they are pretty much the same but the Trezor 5 has a touch screen. Just make sure to not get a Trezor One or the Model T as they do not have a secure element chip which makes them more vulnerable to attacks. There is also no Trezor with bluetooth, so if you depended on that, Trezor is probably not for you.

The Trezor 3 has pretty much a similar feel like the Leder Nano S. Pretty minimal design and als the screen is a monochrome screen. One difference is that you can operate the trezor with one hand only. There is also the equivalent of Ledger Live which is called Trezor suite. I do not think Trezor Suite is particularly useful though. I prefer to do my stuff in third party wallets. Setup is similar to setting up a Ledger. You can chose a pin, a passphrase etc. 

I tested my wallets with Frame.sh, Rabby and Metamask. One important thing is that the Trezor Suite has to run even though you only want to connect to a browser wallet.  

In Frame.sh I can only find my Ledger Legacy wallets and the first one in the Ledger Live derivation path. All other ones in this path cannot be accessed. Same with Metamask. This is a consequence of Ledger not using the standard derivation paths.

Rabby easily finds all my wallets and I can use them perfectly. If you confirm a transaction in Rabby an additional window pops up which connects to the Trezor and through which the transaction is confirmed. It works, but is a bit ugly. 

The trezor itself is relatively simple. There are no settings to configure the device itself. No apps you have to upload and choose. The screen is slightly more informative than on the Ledger Nano S and you can actually see what you are signing. Security wise this is so much better than the blind signing on the Ledger. 

Your device gets wiped if you input the pin wrongly 16 times, which is much more often than on the Ledger which wipes itself after 3 wrong pin inputs. So if you are paranoid about this make the pin one digit longer on the Trezor.

A big difference is how passphrases are handled. On the Ledger you input them on the device and set a pin to access it. On the Trezor you have to input the passphrase on the Computer using the trezor every time you open it. This can be annoying or if you are on the paranoid side, it could be an absolute show stopper because a keylogger could read your passphrase. It is a very different philosophy compared to the ledger. In my view both have pros and cons. Essentially for both of them is that there is no indication if you used a passphrase on your device or not. Plausible deniability for both. 

Overall, the Trezor 3 is a perfect replacement for my slowly dying Ledger Nano S and I am very happy with it. I will probably get a Trezor Safe 5 as well as the touch screen makes inputting the pin so much easier.

#Daily DevCon #23:

[Unified Ethereum vs L2 Ecosystem Competition: Can we have both? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tds-Bik7zM)

It's Tuesday, December 24, 2024 ‚Äî day 23 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.

##Summary:

unified experience across all chains. This requires a common interface, fast and seamless inter-chain execution, and a focus on user security. The competition from other chains like Solana is driving innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. While there is a risk of decentralization with federations like the super chain, it is crucial to stay decentralized and open source to avoid repeating the mistakes of the centralized web. Vitalik emphasizes the importance of keeping up with advancements in centralized systems and staying competitive in the evolving landscape. Ultimately, the goal is to build a decentralized, competitive, and innovative ecosystem that adapts to the changing technological landscape while preserving decentralization and security.

##Discussion Questions:

How can Ethereum balance the need for innovation and competitiveness with the principles of decentralization and open source development in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape?

In what ways can Ethereum ensure a unified user experience and seamless inter-chain execution while maintaining a strong focus on user security and decentralization in the face of competition from other blockchain platforms like Solana?

Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments. The primary goal here is community development through education.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hluyp6/daily_general_discussion_december_25_2024/m3rjf8t/)

I made my first comment in ethfinance just over 4 years ago, December 15,2020. ETH was around $580 and was about to start one of the biggest ETH runs I ever seen, by May 11th, 2021 prices would be $4,182. 7.2x in 147 days. So doubling roughly every 20 days. ethfinance is where we celebrated all along the way after a long bear market, 2018,2019,2020 were long years ( I was a lurker back then). I don't have many friends in person that I could talk crypto with so through the highs and lows of the last 4 years I turned to ethfinance. It's bittersweet to see the daily going away, it's been such a big part of my life over the last 4 years, but at the same time I'm ecstatic to see r/Ethereum turn around, and become a quality place for Ethereum discussion again, where we will likely welcome many more generations of Ethereum bulls and builders. Where one door closes, another opens. Cheers to ethfinance. Thank you to everyone that has made it such a welcoming place over the years.

<summary>u/wolfparking shares Coinbase's bullish outlook for 2025 then doubles down and reminds us to be weary of where we keep our coins</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hmi8g5/daily_general_discussion_december_26_2024/m3uhzkh/)

Coinbase released their 2025 Crypto Market Outlook. I have to agree that the future looks optimistic from this point of view!

Link: <https://www.coinbase.com/blog/crypto-market-outlook-5-things-to-watch-in-2025>

Stablecoins: Total market cap is at an all-time high of nearly $200B and could move much higher. Why? Because we‚Äôre getting closer to the day when their primary use case will be commerce and capital flows, not trading.

Tokenization: Tokenized real-word assets (RWAs) grew by 60% in 2024. Looking ahead, we see RWAs gaining traction across asset classes, from private credit to commodities and more.

ETFs: Spot crypto ETFs shattered records for AUM in their first year of existence, reaching nearly $37B. And potential regulatory changes, such as allowing in-kind creations and redemptions or staking, could stoke further demand.

Decentralized Finance: DeFi‚Äôs share of crypto trading volume nearly doubled this year to 14%. Innovations like onchain prediction markets are spurring a resurgence of activity.

Regulation: January will see the swearing-in of the most pro-crypto Congress ever. Stay tuned for clear rules that benefit both the industry and consumers.

Be wary of your choice in Crypto Exchanges.

2024 is on track to setting new records for the amount of crypto stolen from exploits and hacks. By Q3 2024, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs reported that over $2.2 billion had been stolen in crypto hacks‚Äîexceeding the estimated $1.8 billion lost in all of 2023.

Here's some of the big ones:

1. Japanese DMM Exchange lost $308 million (stolen private keys were a plausible explanation)

2. PlayDapp‚Äôs $290 million (exploiting a private key vulnerability)

3. Indian Exchange WazirX‚Äôs $235 million (successful hacking into exchange account)

4. Turkish crypto exchange BtCTurk $54 million (details unclear)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hcem8v/daily_general_discussion_december_12_2024/m1p7uev/)

I've been working on an open-source validator desktop app to simplify running Ethereum validators. This all-in-one program provides a clean GUI for installing, updating, and managing validators ‚Äì no terminal commands needed! Perfect for non-technical users who want to stake from home.

Here's a link to the [Ethstaker post](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1hcmjqg/comment/m1p546y/) with the detailed information. Any testing or feedback are always appreciated. Happy Staking!

[u/hanniabu](https://reddit.com/u/hanniabu):

Last week I went to a crypto event. There I met a prominent crypto lawyer (will leave unnamed) who was recruited by Trump/Elon to be a lead in DOGE (department of gov efficiency). I think the title was something like strategic director. He declined because we didn't want to become the fall guy they blame everything on if anything went wrong.

But what he thought was interesting was this must mean they're planning on putting government processes/record onchain. The question is which chain?

We know Elon likes BTC so will it be basic data put onchain? He's also smart and Trump has used Ethereum before so will Ethereum be used? We know they're not the straightest edge so maybe they'll take a backdoor deal and use Solana? We also know he loves Doge and Doge is adding smart contracts so maybe he'll use that?

[u/Itur_ad_Astra](https://reddit.com/u/Itur_ad_Astra):

This is where the greatest advantage of Ethereum (not having a controlling/marketing entity) might prove a huge disadvantage. 

And it's a big fear of mine.

I can *easily* see Solana buying its way into government with a few billions, while I could never see the EF doing that (I'm not sure they could even if they wanted to).

Setting up a neutral selection committee in order to choose the best blockchain would be ideal, but good luck with that.

<summary>u/doublyrobustlydouble discusses Vitalik's latest post on deep funding</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hdwg79/daily_general_discussion_december_14_2024/m21ujxm/)

Vitalik with another fascinating post, this time on ***Deep Funding***: <https://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth/0xaced7a72>

Ever since the DAO many have felt like one of ethereum's killer apps will be to entirely replace "the corporation" with decentralized organizations of some form.  Just some scattered musings on that idea below.. you're much better off spending your time reading vitaliks post.... but hey i felt like writing this out:

Cap tables like [these](https://medium.com/@opencaptable/announcing-the-open-cap-table-excel-standard-ocx-d70f5c6db4b0) drive the main distribution of $ in modern companies.   The gap between the actual distribution of $ and the perceived fair or correct distribution of $ according to effort/value is very large.  While admittedly a hard problem, any significant closing of that gap would be one of those society altering level of impacts.  The kind of thing that I think gets people so excited when they first descend the rabbit hole on Ethereum in the first place.

I feel like the DAO was sort of the right idea (build a plane) but without any of the tools you needed to build the airplane.  Before you can fly you have to discover some wing aerodynamics, you have to get like engines or propulsion figured out, maybe light but strong materials, etc etc I dont know how planes work.

I think more and more we're building out some of these primitives that we'll need to fly the plane.  Defi was necessary just to be able to trade tokens, loan, create liquidity, and all that financial lubrication you need to transaction.  

I don't know if they're part of this plane or some other thing but I think NFTs represent some ability to value in more symbolic or representative ways.  

To me a big driver is L2's bringing down costs while maintaining credible enough decentralization principles/roadmap well enough to not detract from the vision.  That also comes down to our L1 staking community & our ethos of decentralization which members of this sub contribute to every day.  So big f'ing salute to y'all.

And just a lot of fundamental smart contract and regular old web coding nitty gritty that's been done over the years.

Some failed ideas out there too in the world of experimentation (3,3).

I think token launchers on farcaster are starting to put some more of these pieces in place with sort of stupid easy to use but very simple forms of value allocation/distribution.  Essentially very basic fair launch stuff. Put a bunch of tokens out there. People buy them up. Viola. Which honestly has been effective enough to bring some of the largest crypto
 projects to where they are today. 

This deep funding looks like a much more sophisticated and frankly cool version of that.  

I think all these pieces getting built are adding to the viability of some of these more complex but superior collaboration structures.  Advancements in tools = necessary precursor for discovery.   Nobody was discovering bacteria till the microscope came around.  Maybe some of these toy like primitives are creating the tools and building blocks necessary for finally surpassing many existing organizational structures?

Regardless I'm sure the much smarter people than I working on this type of thing are going to do cool stuff.  If you want a bull case for Ethereum short term AND long term it's that the builders making stuff on Ethereum are the most creative, badass group of people I've ever seen.   I'm more than happy to shed the austrian economics crowd and the grifter casino lock my self in a cage or threaten violence to animals/people for money crowd (y'all know who I'm talking about) and back the ethos of Ethereum.  

Forget me with any price whining or nonsense this is the #1 best asset in the ENTIRE world.  Hands down.  It's not even close. And right now it's valued less than mastercard.

Warning for kraken users - I just did a test transaction from my trezor to kraken. I sent 0.001 eth. A block explorer showed that the transaction went through almost instantly  but after over 100 confirmations still nothing showed up in kraken. I checked the kraken deposit terms and they don't credit your account for any deposits under 0.005 Eth! I wonder how much they've made from this policy?! 

If you are doing a test transaction before depositiing to kraken, make sure it's over their minimum required or you lose the funds.

I just pressed the button. We're starting the [collaborative BTC67 effort](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h80hnx/lets_break_btc67_67_btc_reward/)!

In the next two/three days we're going to causally use hundreds of machines scattered around the globe to check for 288230 trillion private keys in the most efficient way possible. The scale is unfathomable and I find that mesmerizing. Twelve people have chipped in for now, for a committed amount of 172k+ USD - which is also super cool.

This is only the beginning though, the first slice of 256 which will hopefully lead to the discovery of the private key holding 6.7BTC!

If you're interested in following this effort unfold live, or contribute to the funding effort to get a part of the reward, shoot me DM to get a discord invite - there's a lot more info there.

Adding on to [yesterday's doot](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hdwg79/daily_general_discussion_december_14_2024/m21ujxm/) from u/doublyrobustlydouble, a 2 part Greenpill podcast recently dropped with Vitalik.

[u/doublyrobustlydouble](https://reddit.com/u/doublyrobustlydouble):

Awesome stuff.  

One thing that jumped out at me:

56:20 paraphrasing Vitalik: 

> "When I wrote my post on this is my dream list on what should go in a wallet there's like 20 teams that replied with hey we're doing this piece of it already.  Theres definitely a tragic aspect to this that there's all this work being done but it's not getting through the information network to the rest of the ecosystem. 

> I think having a strategy for that is important. It might seem wasteful to spend 20% of time on distribution but on the other hand having a great thing with distribution go 2x slower than it otherwise would is also wasteful. So it's a good thing to be on the ball about"

1) This is something I've always felt tokens should be relatively good at.  You are a new project, you have a token, if you're relatively unknown but have a good project the hope is that savvy investors looking for the next 100x see that and invest accordingly.  

Now in some ways I think the meta bull/bear market game correlation obfuscates a lot of this as projects & ecosystems rise and fall together.  It doesn't particularly matter if you invest in great projects if the bear is on and the floor is falling out.  Similarly we saw a lot of essentially trash rise with the rising tide during the bull.  

Similarly teams with scammy mechanisms seemed to survive.  Aka if you can grift your investors, take their money, and do cycles of pump and dump then you can end up with more market share than honest teams with good products.  

I think we see a lot of this frankly in the memecoin space where shiny % gains exist to draw people in to a long term pure extraction game.

And then there's the hard part of once a (or set of) savvy early investors discover a project and pump up the market cap a bit, is your alignment off now because X% of the rewards for the project go to investors who haven't done much except add some $ or ETH.  Now I think that design of tokenomics in a way where creators get rewarded, speculators get rewarded (some), and some rewards are held for the future is likely the vague solution here. 

2)  In light of some of the inefficiencies above, how does r/ethfinance (or soon to be r/ethereum) provide a sort of funnel that leads people down good paths towards the best and brightest parts of the ethereum ecosystem?

Vitalik has always done a good job of this.  Look at this initial post, which links to a tweet, which takes you down the greenpill rabbit hole, which takes you to a huge number of different ideas and individuals who are linked to projects etc.  

I think one of the main benefits of this sub is that so many people here have excellent filters (experience can help here, often times you have to step in a little muck to realize what stinks) for which projects and rabbit holes are worthwhile and which ones aren't.  I feel like a lot of this info is crystalized through posts over the years.  Doots is an excellent example.  

I also wonder if there's other ways in which this sub can utilize it's place as somewhat of an entry funnel for new people and set them onto the best rabbit holes to explore.  Or frankly for those of us who are old hat but still struggle to keep up with the and greatest in this now too huge to realistically follow industry.

#Daily DevCon #14:

[ETH++: A roadmap to (real) decentralization in a world of centralized power ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncAbQBVPV2Q)

It's Sunday, December 15, 2024 ‚Äî day 14 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.

##Summary:

The talk delves into various concepts related to the Ethereum blockchain technologies discussed at the Ethereum Developer Conference (DevCon). The speaker explores potential scenarios where Ethereum's system could face challenges and discusses the importance of global power distribution in the network. Emphasizing pillars such as permissionless, distributed, geoeconomic decentralization, and neutral builder efficiency, the speaker highlights the need to push power to the network's edges to achieve true decentralization. The talk also touches on topics such as programmable cryptography, the risks of centralization in staking, and the promotion of technologies like tees for solving complex problems in the blockchain space.

##Discussion Questions:

- How can Ethereum improve its global power distribution within the network to enhance decentralization and prevent centralization issues, especially in the context of staking?

- In what ways can programmable cryptography and technologies like tees be further leveraged to address complex challenges and promote a more efficient and decentralized blockchain ecosystem on Ethereum?

Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments. The primary goal here is community development through education.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

That is such an interesting talk. A bit of background. Phil Daian is one of the founders of flashbots and has been at the forefront of MEV research. He wrote the famous 'Flash Boys 2.0' paper 5-6 years ago, which brought the issues of MEV to the discussion table. They built MEV-geth during the mining days, such that miners could have access to MEV. The basic goal was to democratize access to it such that the centralizing forces of MEV does not centralize the mining pools. Same with MEV-Boost which they wrote and open sourced right before the merge in 2022. Without MEV-Boost solo stakers might not have access to MEV and the validator would probably have centralized much more. I would see him as a decentralization maxi through and through.

He goes through and example how nation states look at controlling a decentralized network. His first example is the analysis of Relays. He then goes on to discuss the current topology of the internet which is more or less a handful of a few datacenters connected to each other via corridors of power. He says that these power dynamics needs to be considered when designing protocols. Just yoloing new protocols not considering this will auto centralize in a short time. 

He states 4 pillars of Ethereum, which are non-negotiable. If we fail any of these we will not have built anything of value:

1. Permissionlessness

2. Distributed

3. Geo-economically decentralized

4. Neutral-builder efficient

He says people far away from the current locations of power need to have a possibility to participate on the same terms as the ones closer to the locations of power. More specifically, a protocol should be designed that colocation gives as little advantage as possible. 

Flashbots does amazing research in trusted execution environments (TEE), which is a way to do calculations on your CPU and cryptographically sign that they have been done correctly. He advocates to use these to our advantage in the protocol design. He does not see TEEs as a silver bullet, but it is a great way to take power away from some corridors of power. He suggests that every builder asks themselves in their development if the chosen approach further centralizes the chain or not. He specifically mentions certain approaches in Web2 which lead down to a path of centralization.

He talks about different trade offs in the protocol, for example 1-blcok censorship resistance will probably tip the scale towards more centralization of the protocol at another edge. Therefore, considering these tradeoffs is important. This means that protocol design must be done with a thorough analysis and good basis on what goals we actually want to achieve.

I love Phil Daian;  like a prophet from the Old Testament of the Bible preaching hard truths to the Israelites.  Although he doesn't just talk, he gets stuff built, as haurog documented in their post.

The only thing in this speech that kind of struck a nerve with me was at the 18:00 mark where he takes a swing at the EF (and immediately says he feels bad about doing so) for too much '*napkin research*' -- too much tech-oriented research without first gaining alignment on more fundamental goals of the network.  He has way more contact with the EF than any of us do of course, but I think I see lots of work on alignment by the EF.  Every time I see something new published by Barnabe Monnot or anybody else from the Robust Incentives Group I get excited; I know they're gonna deeply explore the question of *what do we value about this network, and how should that be reflected in the protocol design?*

<summary>u/Sku is skeptical of claims that ETH is underperforming</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hfco5b/daily_general_discussion_december_16_2024/m2egoi7/)

As Ethereum nears a half a trillion market cap, there is a lot of talk about whether Ethereum will "win" or not. So many talking about Ethereum "underperforming", when in reality it's not underperforming at all, it's literally number 2 behind Bitcoin, and no alt L1 is close in 3rd.

When people talk about "underperformance" it's normally on some cherry picked selective timeframe like "over the past week" or "year to date". But all of those timeframes are just noise.

It really amazes me how many smart people get sucked into this strange narrative. For example, compared to Solana. I'm not picking on Solana especially, it's just an illustrative alt L1!

* That if for example, Solana can go from a **$43bn** market cap to **$104bn** in 2024, that is apparently some kind of "outperformance" and they are doing something better than Ethereum.
* But when Ethereum goes from a **$274bn** market cap, to a **$487bn** market cap in 2024, that's underperformance, and we are losing.

The basis for this "take" on performance, is that the Solana gain is 141%, and Ethereum is only up 77% on the year. And that is entirely true, if your goal was to make more money as an investor, in that precise timeframe. But the amount of money one can make investing in a given cherry picked timeframe, has absolutely no relation to the overall success of an ecosystem like Ethereum.

Do you know how hard it is to add $213bn to a market cap? A lot harder than adding $61bn that's for sure. When thinking about the overall success of the ecosystem, it's probably slightly better (though certainly still far from perfect) to think of the total value added, rather than the percentage gain in a timeframe.

Ethereum had to work so hard, and gain so much legitimacy to get to this almost half trillion market cap. The higher you go, the more legitimacy you need, and the more scrutiny you face. None of these alt L1s are playing in the same league. It's a bit like saying that because a soccer team in a small local league scores more goals, they must be better than the EPL champions who scored less.

It's obviously easier to make larger returns starting from a smaller marketcap, but as an investor, you are also taking on more risk investing in an unproven and more speculative asset. And yes, if you want to make more money, you probably do need to take more risks. If I create a small tech start-up, and our valuation increases by 500% in the first year, that doesn't mean we are about to overthrow Microsoft since their stock only gained 20%. It's certain my investors will be very happy their risk paid off, but they are under no illusion that I'm about to put Microsoft out of business,

This constant confusion between "financial gain for an investor over a given period" and "overall success of the ecosystem" is really something to behold. They are not the same thing. Be smarter, don't fall into this thinking trap.

<summary>u/Bergmannskase explains the beam chain to us</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h72g4u/daily_general_discussion_december_5_2024/m0ncmcc/)

I think a lot of the skepticism might have been due to time constraints for the presentation. It was just 30min to unpack a lot
 
I like to imagine the Beam Chain proposal as another shelling point for Ethereum, where the community can get as excited for it as it was during the Merge. It is an ambitious and accelerationist effort focused on a subset of the Ethereum roadmap. And yes, I'm Beam pilled, but I would still like to hear the drawbacks to it.

There are two other talks where he explains the Beam Chain in more details 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88FDeg5JaUk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_qiFdUSzRg&t)

They are worth watching if you are interested and missed them, if you prefer to read, I'll try to summarize them below (I failed, wall of text alert, now I'll post it anyway): 

**TLDR: You are not bullish enough**

In the DevCon presentation, there was a slide where it showed the transition from [Pow to PoS and now to Zk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjuenkv1zrw=758) 

On the other videos, Drake expands and says it should be more accurately called PoS++, seen that it's still PoS, but it will also make use of snarks, and he argues
we should: 

> 1 - Snarkify it all in Ethereum, from consensus to EVM

By snarkifying it, any entity which consumes the Ethereum chain can do it with extremely low resources, by verifying a single proof, and syncing to the tip of the chain. This would make sure we wouldn't have any further dependency on Infura and other centralizing forces.

> 2 - Enshrine the snarkification of ethereum within itself.

WTF is that?

There will be a zk EVM pre-compile, where if you want to launch a zkrollup, you'll only need a single line of code, and you won't need to worry about bugs, nor 
governance to enact changes whenever the EVM changes (it'd be reflected immediately on the pre-compile after any changes to the EVM).

Previously, we had execution sharding which would be limited to 64(or up to 1024?) shards, and each shard would have its own state and grow independently, asynchronously.

Now there will be **synchronous programmable execution sharding**. These programs can deploy as many EVMs as they want, which would further increase the horizontal scaling of L1. These shards can also increase gas limit arbitrarily high, bc validators that verify state transition functions within the EVM only need to verify the snark proofs. 
 
Synchronous programmable execution sharding allows Ethereum to be maximally simple and provide building blocks that people can build around however they like, commoditizing VM, which allows L2s to have custom sequencers, gov and fee tokens, and any other infrastructure that they might want to experiment with. 


Now is the part I didn't really fully grasp, Justin mentions we can go even further:
We can boost programmability by not enshrining EVM itself, but enshrine a zkEVM underneath it. Instead of a zkEVM pre-compile, we have zk Risk-V pre-compile. The EVM would be a Risk-V program/bytecode, which is interpreted in real time by the native VM of the Risk-V.

He also expands on the other items that will be treated under the Beam Chain, but which might be well known to ethfinance already:

**Preconfirmations**

>Can be proportionally as low as ping times, would lead to better UX and become better than sqlana's, while keeping decentralization on Ethereum, and can be divided into:

>>1. execution preconfirmations: you know how your tx will execute: eg. you'd know exact uniswap trade price and fees you'll pay
>>2. inclusion preconfirmations: you only know it'll be included, but you don't know how

>On L1, the best we can do is the weaker type **b**, but we expect most users to move to L2 so they'll enjoy the type **a** instead.


Regarding **slot times**:

>12s slot times was picked as a conservative measure as a trade-off to keep the values of Ethereum, which aims to be extremely secure, credibly neutral and robust. After further optimization, we can comfortably reduce slot times to 4s, which is good enough from a UX perspective while safely maintaining the process for a round of attestations (where a subset of validators make signatures, gossip and aggregate it to be included in the chain). 

>>Which trade-off? 

>>1. Have solo stakers with high latency home internet connections worldwide
>>2. Have as many validators and economic security as possible per slot(see attestations 
for them all)


With **attester proposer separation**, we can:
 
>1. remove timing games as a concern to validators, 
>2. remove MEV spikes due to volatility, 
>3. remove worries about sophistication by [having to deposit collateral with preconfirmations](https://ethresear.ch/t/credibly-neutral-preconfirmation-collateral-the-preconfirmation-registry/19634)

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard gives us a brief history of crowd funding on the blockchain</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h8m296/daily_general_discussion_december_7_2024/m0x6jrp/)

A brief history of crowd funding on the blockchain. The OG killer use case for blockchains once we got permissionless transaction solved was crowd funding. There's just a lot of money globally that would like access to early stage opportunities and blockchains (due to no KYC) allow that money to access them, no matter how hairbrained the scheme may be.

The first manifestations of this back in 2015 were ICOs like Ethereum's. Send us some BTC and we'll give you some genesis tokens on our new chain. Shortly after this were on-chain ICOs like Bancor and Golem that were mega hits in that age. Again, send us some ETH and you get some genesis tokens. Normally, at least in the US, this would be illegal under securities laws but Ethereum got away with it under the guise that ETH is a new commodity because it doesn't give you a claim on revenue but was just a utility token used in the protocol. Once that precedent became set everyone copycatted that answer to raise stupid amounts of money in what was clearly one of the most exciting periods to invest I've ever experienced. Obviously most tokens shouldn't be "utility tokens" and this led to terrible UX for a lot of projects but if you're wondering why this terrible UX caught on, avoiding securities laws is the answer. Thanks Gary!

Then the SEC started suing US companies that tried this so the trend dried up, it wasn't proven illegal mind you, the SEC just created enough regulatory uncertainty and threat so no one wanted to try it just to be the standard bearer in a 4 year lawsuit (thanks Ripple!). Naturally all the ETH that was given to these projects was then cashed out to fund the project or just to grift and we were left holding the bag on a historically awful drawdown of ETH from $1400 to $80. Anyone complaining about the ratio and the bear market this time around has either forgotten what that felt like or wasn't around in 2018. That was *brutal*. I digress though.

A few years later, necessity remains the mother of invention and the need was still there to offer crowd funding so the ecosystem thought up a new mechanism for this. Rather than *selling* tokens, projects would just give tokens away in a massive inflationary bonanza. They would not only give tokens away to people just escrowing some ETH in a pool, they would give *a lot* of tokens away for people to LP their new token so there was liquidity to sell into. It's probably worth reminding you at this point that [no one is giving tokens away](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#no-one-is-giving-away-free-crypto). This created liquidity pools that the token originator could then dump onto to raise money for their project. Also it was very fun to dump some ETH in YFI or YAM Pool-0s and see 1000% APR numbers stream at you in real-time. We were crazy then, the bear market does weird things to you, you just had to be there for it to make sense.

How did this evade securities laws? Well, the token originator never let people directly invest in the project. All money raised by the project was through secondary sales on Dexs. Whomever bought the tokens didn't know they were buying it from the project so there was no reasonable expectation that the sale was an investment in the project. Genius! Thank you Ripple for setting that precedent. Naturally all of the tokens powering themselves using this inflationary model debased themselves down like 99% from the top, investors got burned as devaluation of the token value was even higher than the ridiculous APR these pools promised, and eventually everyone wizened up to the fact that [inflation is not profit](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#inflation-is-not-profit) so the trend dried up.

So, a few years pass and once again the demand for crowd funding was never going to go away and so the ecosystem thought up an even stupider way of accomplishing this. You see, VCs had invested a lot in the past 4 years during the vacuum of viable crowd funding strategies and they wanted a good way to cash out but they couldn't have the company they invested in getting sued for securities violations by the SEC so once again they gave the token away. This time though they were going to airdrop it rather than make you farm it. No inflation, so people weren't scared of it but nonetheless retail were going to get dumped on by VCs. The VCs would recoup more than their initial investment even if the project then died at this stage so everyone was happy except some people who bought YT tokens (you degens!) or bought the token that VCs then dumped on. Most of these projects were so early stage they barely had a functioning product (looking at you Eigen) or were things like LRTs where there isn't even a plan to build a product.

And so what we learn from all of this is that there is a demand for crowd funding and that it isn't going away no matter what the SEC wants. Projects are going to kickstart, gofundme, launch memecoins, brazenly violate SEC desires but base their company outside US legal reach, etc and people are going to invest in those projects no matter how scammy the fundraising mechanism is because that is just human nature and the technology fundamentally enables it in an unstoppable way. Every attempt by the SEC to stop crowd funding has just led to less honest mechanisms for doing so. It's actively hurting investors. Of all of these approaches, ICOs were the most fundamentally honest and I hope we bring them back. Banning ICOs does not stop crowdfunding, it just makes the mechanisms for it less honest and drives innovation overseas.

That said there are a variety of changes I would suggest for how we do ICOs to add better price discovery mechanisms that I'll write about in another post.

/u/Tricky_Troll you should write about the current landscape of grant and retroactive funding for non-token projects.

<summary>u/haurog discusses his move to signal for an increased gas limit and u/austonst questions the extra data we need to make the right call regarding gas limit changes</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h8m296/daily_general_discussion_december_7_2024/m0uykvo/)

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

Many thanks to u/elixir_knight for initiating the discussion about increasing the block gas limit here and everyone contributing to the discussion: <https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h5gs1z/daily_general_discussion_december_3_2024/m06g83l/>

I had my reservations due to the Pectra hardfork with the blob increase and the not yet approved calldata repricing (EIP-7623). Last Thursday in the ACDE (all core devs execution call) there was a clear vote to include EIP-7623 into Pectra. 

With this in mind I thought about it again and also read the recent ethresearch posts about the block arrival times and available bandwidths: <https://ethresear.ch/t/block-arrivals-home-stakers-bumping-the-blob-count/21096>, <https://ethresear.ch/t/bandwidth-availability-in-ethereum-regional-differences-and-network-impacts/21138>

Both of them focus on the blob number increase and there are some subtle nuances which makes it a bit different for block size increases. Nevertheless, they both agree that the network can safely handle the suggested blob size increase and I do not see from the data that the network would have issues with an additional maximum gas limit increase. If we see the network slowly getting into trouble with the slowly increasing block sizes, it is pretty simple to reduce the max gas limit again. 

Therefore, I set my nodes to broadcast a suggested gas Limit of 60M instead of the current 30M. The instructions for it can be found on pumpthegas.org. Depending on your setup and client choices you have, you need to do the settings in the execution, the consensus or the validator client. I really hope we will get an improvement here as the UX for changing this number is far from optimal. Looking forward to more validators doing this and we will get a slowly increasing block size.

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst):

I'm really glad that the call for better analysis of bandwidth overhead was answered. I feel pretty good moving ahead with the 6/9 blob increase. I really hope, now that we have better systems in place for monitoring available bandwidth, that we continue to keep an eye on those metrics. Does the move to 6/9 play out as expected? Does available bandwidth decrease by the expected amounts? We'll be looking at more changes to the blob count in the future, so we need to get a good understanding of the actual effect this change has.

I can understand the reasoning for increasing the gas limit, particularly contingent on inclusion of 7623. And if we've decided that there is bandwidth to spare, it makes sense that some of that should go to the L1 rather than all being allocated to blobs.

I feel less certain about the effect it will have on home staking operations. Presumably bandwidth is the limiting factor for most people, and from that perspective increasing (even doubling) block size isn't too impactful on bandwidth usage compared to adding on a bunch more blobs.

But increased block size has potential effects beyond just bandwidth. CPU load, SSD speed, and SSD space (from increased state growth) could all be limiting factors for some people's setups (would there be an effect on RAM too--I'm not sure). How much "overhead" do home stakers have on each of these metrics before they'd be forced to upgrade? Fortunately these are easier upgrades to make, whereas my upload speed is heavily throttled and I'm already paying for the best Internet plan I can buy. There's the can of worms about what the cost to operate a validator *should* be, but assuming we could all agree on that, it still takes work to figure out the correlation between block size and cost.

Do we have data on this? For a X% increase in average block size, is there an effect on block import time in a way that could effect attestation effectiveness? Which CPUs and SSDs become non-viable and how does this affect the minimum cost to run a validator? Or maybe the answer is that bandwidth is the only limiting factor and there are zero other problems; that would be great! But do we know that's the case?

I'm happy to support a blob increase with the data now to support it. But I feel like I need to be convinced that the gas limit increase is also justified and I just haven't seen that yet.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll updates us on his pivot into working in web 3</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ha36r5/daily_general_discussion_december_9_2024/m19xfm0/)

Hey all, I just thought I'd give you all an update with where I am at regarding web 3 employment after Devcon. As some of you may know, I have been involved with some smaller part-time projects lately, primarily in the grants ecosystem. These have included scouting out grant opportunities for EthStaker, getting some funding to finish off and polish the EVMavs project "RocketSchool" and I also did some grant work a few months back with an NZ based start-up which the founders ended up putting on hold. Then, at Devcon, having chatted with a few people in the grants ecosystem, I had an idea to create a website that displayed a comprehensive list of ecosystem grants with a brief synopsis of who they're for, criteria, funds available etc since everyone I had talked to at that point thought it was a good idea and was unaware of any existing platforms doing this. After two days of planning how to execute on this, in literally the closing hours of Devcon, I met someone who had already done this and 10x better than I'd have been able to do it.

It was a bit demoralising after planning so much for my own project but they gave me some people to contact to see if they're looking to hire and since then I have been in discussions with people (watch this space)...

So, in the spirit of promoting a genuinely useful public good which I can't believe almost nobody I talked to knew existed, if you're interested in finding a grant to fund your project, check out the [KarmaGAP funding map](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/funding-map) for a comprehensive list of grants with filter and search tools, or if you would prefer an AI tool to simply identify what might suit you best, try [ecosystem.vision](https://ecosystem.vision).

Also, shoutout to KarmaGAP for creating a really cool framework for grantee reputation and tracking with the Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) which is aiming to create a standard across grant programs which allows grantors and donors to see how previous funding has facilitated grantee project development. This will be a key stepping stone going forwards to improving the grants ecosystem so that we're utilising our funding as efficiently as possible. I will be writing more on this soon as a follow-up to u/LogrisTheBard's piece on [web 3 crowdfunding.](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h8m296/daily_general_discussion_december_7_2024/m0x6jrp/)

In the mean time, I have decided to continue setting up my own website and service which will aim to raise awareness of grant opportunities through various means and also offer grant consulting and grant writing services to those who need help. So I look forward to announcing something to everyone here soon!

Finally, I have also signed onto a local start-up in the blockchain supply chain tracking space who have some promising partnerships for their app built on Base. This is a part time role and I will be sharing more details on this in tomorrow's daily, but be aware that this is effectively sponsored content. Regardless, I'm excited to share it as they're going for an interesting combo of very serious business-facing real world use case and new age memery to generate a consumer user base beyond their B2B tool. Plus it'll be my first official web 3 role on an ongoing basis!

**Daily DevCon #8:**

[Keynote: [title redacted] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plvy7fgFCm4)

It's Monday, December 09, 2024 ‚Äî day 8 of our DevCon listen-along.

Summary:

The transcript discusses a proposed redesign of the Ethereum consensus layer called the "beam chain," aiming to incorporate new ideas and advancements. The proposal focuses on redesigning the consensus layer to address existing technical debt and implement new technologies like SNARKs and ZK VMs. The presenter emphasizes the need for a safe transition and outlines potential steps for implementation and testing. They also highlight the importance of reusing existing infrastructure, encouraging incremental upgrades, and involving multiple consensus client teams.

Discussion Questions:

1. How does the presenter address the risks associated with deploying multiple changes at once in the beam chain proposal?

2. What considerations are made in the proposal regarding the choice of ZK VM for the beam chain, and how does this affect decentralization and flexibility within the Ethereum ecosystem?

Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments. The primary goal here is community development through education.

So after looking over his article, it seems he's just being dramatic to garner views and make a name for himself. Or maybe it's because he's invested in other projects too and is talking his bags.

Here's his main points from his article:

>**Ethereum is under increasing competition from all sides:**

>BTC is better money than ETH.

No it's not.

>Solana is a more performant smart contract platform.

No it's not. 

>Celestia is a more performant rollup platform.

I honestly don't know if this is true or not. 

>**We need to acknowledge the following trends:**

>L1 ‚Äì New asset issuance and activity is leaving Ethereum L1 for alt-L1s (e.g., Solana) and L2s (e.g., Unichain). The desire to keep apps on the L1 is unclear (as is the L1 scaling roadmap, consequently).

There really isn't any clear tendency that anyone is leaving Ethereum for any other ecosystem. There's no decline in TPS, users, TVL or apps or anything to indicate this is true. Creating an L2 on Ethereum is not an indication of leaving Ethereum, it's literally the opposite. The roadmap is perfectly clear, we're scaling Ethereum by creating bandwitdth for L2s and we're working towards removing the fragmentation.

>L2 ‚Äì Ethereum L2s are highly fragmented. A single chain operated by a public company (i.e., Base) is currently set to dominate the field.

Switching to alternative L1s causes even more fragmentation. Again, L2s will not continue to be silo'd so this is a temporary obstacle, but bridging to an L2 is a 100x better experience than bridging to another L1. Also, is way way to early to propose that Base is going to be the L2 winner or that there isn't room for 100s of L2s. 

>ETH ‚Äì There is ongoing disagreement over ETH‚Äôs role (is it money?), value capture (do we need to scale the L1 for value capture?), and importance (should we care about ETH‚Äôs value capture and price?) amidst relative underperformance over the past couple years.

There's really not any meaningful disagreement about this within the community. Everyone mostly agrees ETH is money. It's literally THE native currency of Ethereum. This shit is so dumb. Also ETH is up againt BTC over the last 4 years, so in spite of BTC having its moment, we've actually been performing better since the last cycle.

<summary>u/benido2030 starts a discussion about the community members with more divisive rhetoric</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1hbmz67/daily_general_discussion_december_11_2024/m1i3wu9/)

I really like that there are ETH community members that really start pushing the ecosystem/ EF/ researchers out of the comfort zone. And just to be clear, this is not about Max Resnick, though he might have played a part in that (and as stated yesterday, think this was net positive, but it's still good he's gone). 

But there are more people like Jon Charb, Kain Warwick, Eric Connor, Konstantin Lomashuk etc. They all have different approaches, but I think they really want to improve Ethereum. 

Especially after listening to one of the latest bankless episode with Jon Charb (and Mike Ippolito) I have to change my opinion about him. I don't agree with everything he is saying, but I also think that with more context his thoughts aren't so far off. 

Just one example: first he says "we/ the L1 have to compete with Solana execution", which I think is likely wrong. But later he says "we don't have to copy Solana, but we need 60M gas, cut block times from 12 to 8 and later to 4 secs". This is something I can get behind, mostly because I believe we have to because of path dependency, as in: We shouldn't risk to be right long term, but lose on the short term and become cosmos 2.0 (both in a design, but also economic/ relevance sense)

I think this "three fronts" / wartime and peacetime meta is spot on and likely needs more pragmatism. Which is even more fascinating since some years ago "the ETH people" were the pragmatic ones (remember the Vitalik convex blog?) but apparently with each new "generation" this changes, at least on a relative basis.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h1pbw9/daily_general_discussion_november_28_2024/lzgnfg5/)

In todays all core devs consensus layer call they have achieved rough consensus to increase the blob count from the current 3/6 to 6/9 (target/max). This would double the number of blobs by average from what we have today. Pretty cool to see we get more space for rollups to scale and grow. Looking forward to the the Pectra hard fork. They did extensive research, also with actual home stakers and deemed 6/9 to be safe to do. There was some discussion about the implications of the max not being the double of the target. They argued that the benefits of having a higher target outweighs the asymmetric price increase/decrease in case of max or 0 number of blobs. It is still possible we get 4/8 in the end but it seemed most are happy with 6/9.

Could some folks share their thoughts on tokenization of assets / RWAs? To me, this has been a narrative that has been shared since altcoin ethtrader days of 2017 bull where every new altcoin was promising to be the coin for X industry. I‚Äôve been seeing more posts / comments about tokenization of assets recently, including hearing about it through videos from blackrock, EY, and other enterprises building on ethereum.¬†

I recently saw this tweet suggesting $500T+ TAM through tokenization of assets:¬†https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1862209815642349893 and I also saw this comment in an ethfinance thread a week or so ago suggesting tokenization of RWAs as being a huge driver in ethereum use case and value proposition: https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gxe7su/comment/lyi7j2x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

My question is, are there any companies actively tokenizing assets today? If not, why hasn‚Äôt this carried out yet if it‚Äôs been a leading narrative for years now? Why does a blockchain like ethereum need to tokenize assets and disrupt the current way of doing things? Why would industries adopt this and migrate the way they‚Äôve been handling trillions of dollars of assets to ‚Äútokenize‚Äù now? What benefits does it provide to industries? I guess I‚Äôm trying to understand whether tokenization of assets is something that is more of a ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible to do it‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúit‚Äôs solving massive fundamental problems for tons of industries‚Äù like the sentiment suggests when I read posts about it. Thanks in advance for any thoughts / knowledge / resources people can share!

<summary>After many years, u/Zirup finds themselves in the ETH camp</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h3623z/daily_general_discussion_november_30_2024/lzpwllm/)

Class of '17 here. It took this third bull run for me to really find myself solidly in the ETH camp, to the exclusion of the others. It's just the right community/roadmap/philosophy for what I believe will bring the best future forward. I'll be scaling out of my positions in the other majors in 2025 and finally setting up my solo staker.

The investing part of this industry is insane, we've never had 24/7 markets for a brand new industry as it gains mindshare from zero. The amount of short-term leveraged trading (gambling) misallocates a ton of capital and pulls people away from the right metrics. I've finally made enough money to think about what projects I want to support rather than just what projects will pump the highest. And it also took me years to be able to understand the industry deep enough to see the trade offs of each major project.

Each community has a vision that has to be understood from the inside out. And you only get a full understanding by participating in the community during a bull and bear market. Thanks to this place and others like it that have kept pushing forward.

<summary>u/EggIll7227 discusses the importance of storytelling</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h3wpf4/daily_general_discussion_december_1_2024/lzym84t/)

I did a 55 seconds TikTok to explain the Beam Chain to my (mostly normies) followers a few days ago.

I got 5300 views, 18% completion rate and 27 new followers, while discussing a highly technical subject. These are *excellent* numbers for a niche nano-influencer like me.

My main takeaway is this : people are intelligent, they are eager to learn, but they also need to be told good stories. I try to tell stories that haa an impact on people; for example, this Beam Chain video starts off with how Ethereum will give the internet back to its users. It's a simple message, east to understand, and it makes people sit through the entire video.

This kind of storytteling is the reason why XRP is pumping. XRP holders believe that every bank in the world will use the token. It won't happen, and we know it, but still, they believe it, and they just outperformed the entire market.

Ethereum is not built on false promises. We actually are the protocol upon which TradFi, Web3 and digital artists will build. So we have an excellent narrative + we will deliver.

This is what I'm talking about when I say the EF should do more to communicate our story. If I, a nano-influencer with zero marketing dollars available, am able to make people care about what Ethereum has to offer, *imagine what the EF could do if it really tried*.

We are not selling a vague, distant dream. We are selling a working product that has the potential to change arts, culture, the internet, finance, and more.

Now we need to tell our story.

A few days ago we had a streak of invalid blocks: <https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h1pbw9/daily_general_discussion_november_28_2024/lzdk8fs/>

The post mortem just got released: <https://github.com/gattaca-com/helix/blob/main/incidents/post_mortem_28_nov.md>

It was indeed a builder/relay issue. A builder sent invalid blocks and the block simulation by the relay timed out which did not invalidate the block or demote the builder. That is why the builder could continue to deliver invalid blocks. The builder was shut down after some time. The helix code has been patched and will demote a builder even if the simulation just times out.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h4ob2e/daily_general_discussion_december_2_2024/m00zp9o/)

Greetings! Today is the first day of our listen-along group for devcon talks. I once imagined this as "Ethereum Public Radio" (EPR), but we'll see where it goes.

I guarantee you that I will flake and not post these regularly. That's not even my goal. My goal is to spur growth and development. If it's going to be successful, it needs YOU to take some responsibility and develop this idea along with me.

Here's the [grand idea](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h0xkvx/daily_general_discussion_november_27_2024/lz8b95w/).

Every day, we'll post a link to a DevCon talk, these are [ranked by listens](https://github.com/hanniabu/devcon-7-videos/blob/main/videos.md), so we'll start at the top and work our way down. The list is very likely to evolve as we go forward. Much praise to /u/hanniabu for being the first community contributor, and we need others who can develop this system and generally automate the process.

Your job is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable content. The primary goal here is community development through education.

[u/mj102500](https://reddit.com/u/mj102500):

I don‚Äôt really understand all the FUD. I get some of it relative to Bitcoin. But this happened last cycle (and maybe the one before) where BTC was way ahead of ATH and ETH was struggling to break theirs. But it then shot up to a .08 ratio. 

Compared to all the Alts that have been pumping. Go look at where they are relative to their ATH. They are just catching up with progress ETH already made. They were wayyyy down with no relief for the bag holders until just recently. ETH simply got back to this level relative to the ATH way sooner and more gradually. 

DOT is still less than 20% of ATH. XRP is less than 70%. Cardano a little over a third. They pumped more but they‚Äôd been lagging for over a year vs ETH

[u/Luukiemans](https://reddit.com/u/Luukiemans):

The FUD and negativity is so unnecessary. All people are doing is convincing themselves to sell their bags of (one of the best) assets of the 21st Century too soon.

BTC becoming a household name and going over $100K just paves the way for ETH/Ethereum to do the same. But this time almost anything is possible with the asset. Some use cases will hit PMF, some won't. Stablecoins are already there and its usage and minting will grow exponentially. More will follow.

L2s are popping off. ETH supply growth is halted and sometimes even burning. There's not enough ETH for everyone. If you even have one ETH you are well above the average. Every major investment party has ETH or has ETH on their to buy list.
The ecosystem is flourishing with a lot of good, smart and hard working people. The number of digital innovations coming from Ethereum are up only.

Shoot the Bear You and embrace the Bull You!

Also, sell some to get your life in a better position. Be that mentally, financially, physically or just to reward yourself with some fun things or a great trip. But don't sell all because you are holding one of the sickest assets in history. Create a vision for your life and your investment life so you can win now and win later. Set yourself up for success now and in the future.

You are all going to make it.

<summary>u/supephiz still isn't convinced by Solana</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gljtif/daily_general_discussion_november_7_2024/lvzhcye/)

I pretty much swore I'd never comment on solana, but here i am. I see the gains just like you, but I'm still not convinced to buy. It really boils down to a few fundamental principles..

A successful smart contract platform needs radical decentralization. We have some of this, but we still need more. Our home/solo staker programs are first class and they could STILL improve (with your help). Solana lacks radical decentralization and is positioning itself as an easy target for future censorship. Ironically, by the time they recognize this need it'll be too late to get it.

Solana is trying to scale at Layer 1. I'm not mad. We initially thought this was viable until we realized that the only way to achieve worldwide saturation was to adopt the layered approach. Our shift to a layered model has been challenging, but it's clearly working and it will keep us going well into the foreseeable future. 

Ethereum continues to be the leader in innovation, capacity, decentralization, and mindshare. We don't have to be weak and shy in the face of detractors, they're just like everyone else in the long line of competitors yapping away on Twitter. 

For me, it always comes back to the strength of the decentralized network. We can be the best and STILL expect better. The best thing any of us can do is turn off the ticker and start spinning up home validators.

<summary>u/Dreth explains how cheap and easy it is to fake on-chain metrics</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gljtif/daily_general_discussion_november_7_2024/lvznjke/)

I want to make this as a top comment and not a reply to /u/fecalreceptacle's comment because I think it would highlight how easy it is to fake a metric like "Solana reached a record 123 million active addresses in October, up over 42% from September" with better visibility:

1. Take random rollup, in this case I'll pick arbitrum, not even the cheapest (which should be base iirc)

2. Take random tx from the latest txs in arbiscan.io, i picked [0x9ad82848711ba22084fd038473a43f3c37b30375ad191dee9542db8cb180ba51](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x9ad82848711ba22084fd038473a43f3c37b30375ad191dee9542db8cb180ba51)

3. Check its fee: 0.0000017983 ETH, about 0.005195 USD 

4. Assuming I have absolute control over the network and want to fake engagement, I can set the fee artificially low as to not clog the network up, but assume we can clog the network and pay this exact same fee for every tx. Really doesn't matter that much, Solana is a centralised network for all intents and purposes anyway. Then set a target, we want 100 million active addresses.

5. Make a simple script in a very fast systems programming language like Rust or C++ which derives an address from some seed, sends this same tx or a varied set of txs (we don't have to make the exact same tx, but instead have a bunch of different kinds of txs in a particular array), we send assets to each address from a set of addresses, run it.

Assume sending the assets costs  0.0000015 ETH and sending the tx  0.000002 ETH, this is a per address cost of 0.0000035

a total of 350 ETH for 100 million addresses, which @2880 USD is about 1M dollars.

Faking 'record high' activity on a network costs 1M USD.

Too expensive? okay use a cheaper network, let's go to base and pick a random tx:

This one: [0x08f4ac69d791bbcb0cb9a88372da43dc11a4a26ea5fe49551e347b9a4428b400](https://basescan.org/tx/0x08f4ac69d791bbcb0cb9a88372da43dc11a4a26ea5fe49551e347b9a4428b400)

Cost: 0.000000213459331152 ETH, round this up 0.0000003 ETH, cost of funding the address, say 0.00000025 ETH, total 0.00000055 ETH

55 ETH for 100 million addresses @2880 USD = 158400 USD

Faking 'record high' activity on a network costs <200k USD

In the meantime some Gnosis team members became aware of our project and started to get interested in it. They looped a few core devs into it and they plan to arrange a meeting at Devcon with us. Might meet a few of my heroes next week. Some of the core devs unsurprisingly are super hardware nerds and jumped on the opportunity to run their clients on the new hardware. One of the geth devs really wanted to buy all available board types immediately to play around with them.

<summary>u/bagogel12 tells us a crazy crypto tale</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gnu2i8/daily_general_discussion_november_10_2024/lwdndhz/)

In the wild world of crypto, some stories just keep getting crazier. Here‚Äôs one that involves whales, FTX, and DeFi (üêã, ‚öñÔ∏è, üí∞)‚Äîand one infamous character: Humpy the Whale.

Back in 2022, ‚ÄúHumpy,‚Äù a major holder of Balancer (BAL) tokens, made headlines by leveraging Balancer‚Äôs ‚Äúve-tokenomics‚Äù in a high-stakes move to gain significant control. With the largest share of veBAL, he directed protocol rewards back to his own holdings, effectively seizing control over Balancer‚Äôs governance. This led to a tenuous ‚Äútruce‚Äù where Humpy remained a major veBAL holder, securing a continuous stream of rewards‚Äîbut agreed not to act against Balancer‚Äôs interests openly. [Read more about it here.](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/balancer-ve-tokenomics-whale)

Fast forward to 2024, and Humpy‚Äôs name resurfaced‚Äîthis time in Compound, where he attempted a similar governance play. [More on this recent maneuver.](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/humpy-returns-compound-dao-tokens-in-return-for-fee-sharing)

But here‚Äôs where it gets even more interesting.

A recent Twitter thread on FTX creditor clawbacks claims that ‚ÄúHumpy‚Äù wasn‚Äôt just stirring the DeFi waters; he was also allegedly siphoning funds from FTX. At one point, he was reportedly worth over $1 billion on FTX, successfully pulling out $450 million and $230 million by manipulating low-liquidity markets with coins like BTMX, MOB, BAO, TOMO, and SXP (or, as some would call them, ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù). FTX‚Äôs intertwined losses with Alameda are significant: by April 2021, Caroline Ellison, then CEO of Alameda, estimated that Alameda had taken on $400 million in losses from ‚ÄúMOB guy.‚Äù Later, an FTX employee estimated total losses nearing $1 billion linked to these manipulations.

By the way, humpy circumvented KYC by using emails like ‚Äú[motherofallburgers@protonmail.com](),‚Äù ‚Äú[turkiyepizzakebab@int.pl](),‚Äù ‚Äú[donerkebabveryspicy@int.pl](),‚Äù and ‚Äú[sanpedropizza@int.pl](),‚Äù slipping past safeguards multiple times. Food coins, anyone?

Tracing back these accounts unveils potential links to money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and organized crime networks spanning Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian syndicates, with connections to human trafficking and even terrorist financing networks.

This is more than just an anecdote‚ÄîHumpy‚Äôs story illustrates the deep, complex webs within the crypto world. The lines between DeFi innovation, centralized exchange exploitation, and organized crime are still blurring,. The story also unvails the incompetence and greed of FTX/SBF, allowing this behaviour and led many customers with a loss. 

Official complaint you find here for download, with some more infos. Allegeldy, there are links between Humpy and a variety of money laundering operations and Ponzi schemes dating back more than a decade. Also, there are ties to Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian organized crime networks.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1golgs1/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2024/lwl3ayc/)

The "[FUD](https://twitter.com/jon_charb/status/1855891797471560066)" is back, but let's have a closer look. Especially the Celestia part is funny and showing bag bias. There is one tweet in there that I think makes a good point:

>The L1 is why Ethereum is winning the multi-chain game right now and not the Cosmos Hub even though Cosmos realized multichain earlier on  
  
Path dependence and balance of power matters  
  
Ethereum L1 was the center of crypto, so L2s naturally grew out of it

I am in favor of scaling L1 despite knowing that down the road every effing L1 will need L2s to scale because path dependence is a thing and we can't let the advantage this ecosystem has slip. 

Down the road L2s are inevitable. That is afaik one of the main reasons for researchers and e.g. Vitalik for not scaling L1 anymore. They see it similar to the difficulty bomb we had when ETH was still POW. 

While I get the idea, I think it's wrong. We will never scale L1 to fit *all* the tx of the world. But we should scale L1 in the meantime and invest some core dev time to keep the position.

**Devcon & Friends Update 3** ([Previous](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1golgs1/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2024/lwkn6d8/))

*Devcon Day 1*

Yay finally Devcon! I stopped by the venue yesterday to pick up my wristband, which was peaceful and truly the calm before the storm. There are something like 12,000 people with Devcon tickets, so now that everyone has arrived, it's a massive event. It's big and there's a lot going on, so it's possible to spend the better part of a day just wandering around. Today I did have some other responsibilities but spent most of the day at the venue. Made it to some talks, but in the end not too many.

Talks all have a QR code displayed on the side of the screen which you can scan to get access to a Q&A page to submit questions for after the talk, or upvote other people's questions you like. There's also some way to mint a "card" NFT thing associated with each talk, but you have to scan this QR code that only appears in person, not on the stream. I didn't manage to get the card minting working on my phone, but the Q&A tech worked well. I was very surprised to see that the conference provided plenty of snacks, beverages, and even a full lunch, and somehow *they didn't run out*. With 12k hungry attendees? Well done organizers.

-------

Oh, and the frogs. People love the frogs. This is a Devcon + Zupass initiative to demonstrate use cases of programmable cryptography (in short, prog crypto, hence the name of the project: frogcrypto). In short, on your Devcon ticket there is a link to the frogcrypto page where you can tap a button every 15 minutes to catch a digital frog. The frogs are cryptographic data structures that can be ZK verified in various ways, and last year were a basis for people to implement various demos of progcrypto technology. If you show this frog to the frogcrypto people at the booth, they'll give you a frog plushie on a necklace, with a unique QR code that you can scan to set it up. Then, anyone else can scan your QR code to each get a copy of each other's frogs. The big goal is to catch as many frogs as you can, each one contributing to your score, which you can turn in for prizes. There's the classic frog bucket hat from last year's Devconnect, little frog trinkets of sorts, and among the higher-tier rewards: a programmable cryptography textbook for 300 frogs.

Of course, the QR code is just a URL like any other, so you can always just scan your code, post it to Telegram, and have everyone else click it without having to actually interact in person. I even found a website created just today that lets anyone add their frog URL to a database where everyone can see the full list. So if you can sustain a pace of 4 frogs / minute, that's just 75 minutes of mindless tapping to earn enough to get that textbook. I'm sure by morning people will have written scripts to automatically scrape frogs from the website and automatically connect with them all. Not sure how long the merch will last or if it's worth the effort to collect.

------

A handful of talks today. The Devcon schedule is fantastic for providing info about each talk and speaker, and *actually contains an embedded YouTube video of each talk today*. Amazing. Here:

* Josef Je, Co-founder of PWN DAO & Bordel hackerspace, argued that crypto isn't some fantasy land disconnected from the "real world", it *is* the real world. You can compare onchain revenue like priority fees to other industies' revenues, or compare onchain market capitalization with those of other industries. By those metrics, crypto--purely based on on-chain metrics--is a similar scale as the gaming and entertainment industries. One difference is that the number of people directly working in crypto itself is much lower than those other industries. Josef pointed out to the attendees in the room, "You are the cryptonative economy!"
* Diego Kingston, Co-founder and head of research at Aligned, delivered a lightning talk (only 7 minutes!) on hash-based proof systems. I could only take notes so fast, so here are the bits and pieces. Hash based proof systems work over smaller fields, do not require trusted setups, and make minimal security assumptions. It is easier than most proving systems to generate recursive proofs, but you need linear error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon and a collision-resistant hash function. See: FRI, circle starks. Compile to a set of polynomial equations and use a merkle tree to commit and blah blah blah this should have been like 30 minutes not 7.
* Leo Lara, Team Lead at the EF/PSE, gave a lightning talk on modern ZKP compilers. In short, it sounds like compilers are getting better at including useful abstractions to make developer experience better. But he suggested that zkVMs are probably the future and that most people who want to make use of ZKPs will not write circuits, but instead just write code that compiles down to the VM language (e.g. RISC-V) and prove it with a zkVM.
* Phil Daian of Flashbots laid out his priorities and roadmap for Ethereum's future. He highlighted his biggest concerns by referencing a paper affiliated with the NY Fed that looked at how to ensure "regulatory cooperation" of blockchains, noting MEV-Boost relays as places to apply pressure. Also referenced AWS datacenters and how concentrated they are in the US and Europe. So with that his focus is on decentralization of geo-economic distribution of power, which he things should be a first-class goal of Ethereum, much moreso than any performance metrics. He wants to push back against "UX fentanyl" (the addictive need to make end-user UX perfect even at the expense of other core values) and "napkin research" (basically out-of-touch researchers). Rejecting much of the Ethereum roadmap and current research directions, he instead wants to "TEEify" everything in pursuit of this goal of "pushing power to the edges".
* Justin Drake, researcher at the EF, presented his vision for Ethereum's next era of consensus via the beam chain. A lot has changed since the beacon chain spec was written, and Justin thinks it's time to start the process of developing the next consensus system to replace it. We're talking mechanisms including (probably future forms of these, but today represented by) FOCIL + APS + shorter slots + stake cap + orbit + SSF + state transition function SNARKification + quantum-resistant security + VDFs. Along the way, could clean up a lot of tech debt and simplify things. But really, the list of changes isn't anything people paying attention to research haven't already seen, beyond the need to batch some of the more complex changes together in one fork. The point of this initiative is really the social side of it: an attempt to align the Ethereum community around a shared and more concrete vision of the future. This would be a chance to bring in new talent, form new beam client teams, and light a fire under people's feet to work on a goal that seems ambitious but generally realistic. And at a time when it's particularly in vogue to criticize Ethereum's governance and roadmap (see: Phil Daian just before, Lido, CT), the beam chain is an ambitious and optimistic take on Vitalik's roadmap. Happy to talk through this more.

If anyone has other talks of interest, please send them over. Devcon schedule links are easily shareable and make it really easy to watch the video and catch up.

Back at it tomorrow!

<summary>u/MinimalGravitas discusses the ethOS phone</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gq6ahm/daily_general_discussion_november_13_2024/lwzab4l/)

Just wondering if anyone has bought the dgen1 EthOS phone? If so I'd love to use a referral code from an EthFinancier. First one to reply...

I've been doing a bit of research and really like the sound of the OS: <https://ethosmobile.readme.io/>

It's based on GraphineOS, which is regarded as one of (if not 'the') most private and secure operating systems available for mobiles. Up until now you've only been able to install it on Google Pixel phones, so I've never tried it before and if I'm honest, I'm more excited about that than the hardware:

<https://grapheneos.org/features>

EthOS adds a bunch of other stuff, most importantly a Light Node, which allows the device to connect directly to Ethereum. It looks like the options for clients are Nimbus or Helios, I use Nimbus for my full node so I guess I'll give Helios a try for the variety, though I've never actually even heard of it before - it looks like it's exclusively a light client:

<https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/>

There's supposedly a bunch of other stuff like the ability to mint NFTs from the camera, which I guess could be useful in an AI image based misinformation dystopia...

Anyway, I really sound like I'm shilling, but I haven't even bought the device yet (hence asking for a code) and certainly have no association with the project. I'm also not at all infallible, so if I've misunderstood something about it then please do let me know - ideally before I order one if it's fatally flawed somehow!

<summary>Shitpost of the week: u/15kisFUD</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ggyuhz/daily_general_discussion_november_1_2024/lutrj2a/)

The French philosopher Albert Camus said there is a juxtaposition between the fundamental human need to attribute meaning to life, and the disinterested meaningless universe in response. He called this the 'absurd'. I didn't truly grasp what he meant until I became an ETH investor.

The fundamental need to attribute reason and rationality to the disinterested irrational market. Camus compared this to the myth of Sisyphus, who was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill every day, only for it to roll back just before it reaches the top. ETH in 2024 is this Sisyphus.

There are a few ways people deal with the absurd. The first one is to commit market suicide; i.e. the liquidation of all holdings, also known as capitulation. A second way is to appropriate our own meaning unto the market. You will hear stuff like "Supply shock incoming", "4 year cycle is playing out" or "Alt season is coming". Camus calls this philosophical suicide. The investor, by clasping to hope still bears a faith commitment which is akin to religion.

Camus rejects both of these strategies and instead poses that one should strive to recognize the absurdity of the market and its irrationality. This acknowledgement is painful but crucial. Instead of succumbing to despair or seeking comfort in religious or philosophical abstractions, Camus advocates for "revolt." This doesn‚Äôt mean rejecting the market but rather resisting the desire to resolve its inherent contradictions. Recognizing the absurd for what it is, brings freedom

In the end, we must imagine ETH happy

<summary>u/696_eth introduces us to another EVMaverick</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ggyuhz/daily_general_discussion_november_1_2024/luwv88o/)

[**Get to know EVMavericks #9**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbUqdicasAUdWmy?format=jpg&name=medium) - YieldDaddy aka EVM 833

**Hi, what do you go by and what is your EVMavericks #?**

Hi 696! Within the online cryptosphere I go around as [YieldDaddy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbUqlWcasAAuKrP?format=png&name=large). The name really started off as sort of a meme in 2022 when the brother and I started aping in a lot of random projects with of course random accounts. Fighting the Ethereum FUD on Twitter with that name was also pretty hilarious to me, so funny enough that is one of the biggest reasons I stuck with that account longterm. I am rocking EVM #833.


**When and how did you get into crypto?**

That should have been around the end of 2016 (already 7 years ago sheeshhh time files..). So one day, I read some random article about Kim Dotcom. It stated he was building a project with Bitcoin. Bitcoin I thought, what? That still exists? Why would that controversial billionaire do something like that? And from that moment, down the rabbit hole called Bitcoin I went. Believe it or not, I actually came into crypto for the tech and have not bought anything until only a couple of months later early 2017.

**How did you make your way into EVMavericks?**

After reading up on Bitcoin I of course stumbled upon all these other crypto that were popping up everywhere during the ICO craze in 2017. Ethereum the 'smart contract' platform, as a tech geek I was very intrigued with the platform which enabled it all, so I deepened myself again in everything I could get my hands on. Reddit with ethtrader and later on ethfinance was one of the best resources I found that I could daily hit with the latest what was going on in Ethereum. As more of a lurker myself I was initially sad that I would miss out on the EVM drop, however with some luck I got my EVM with the raffle. I would have bought an EVM no matter what!

**Happy to hear that you landed your EVM through the raffle! How has your stay been so far? any favorite memories?**

Our Discord is awesome and sometimes its even hard to keep up, however not directly something that stands out. It is just the best place I use to hangout during the bear market, so looking forward when the bull really hits. I did enjoy the most the moments around the EIPandas (themerge), sprotos and the current vibes with the memecoin mania.

**Earlier you said you came into crypto for the tech, what crypto developments excite you nowadays and how do you spend time in crypto?**

ZK tech really piques my interest, mainly because it's hard to fully grasp its potential, and that challenge is what excites me most, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I am also fascinated by topics like the based rollups and pre-confirmations in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lately, I have been just following what thought leaders in the space are tweeting and blogging on, while experimenting with some dApps and occasionally playing the memecoin dartboard.

**Any dApps that have piqued your interested in particular? and how has the memecoin casino been treating you?**

Recently, I've taken an interest in EFP and Infinex as well. EFP, in particular, seems like it has the potential to evolve into something much bigger down the road, which is exciting. The memecoin casino it‚Äôs been a ride for sure! Some wins, some losses, naturally, but thankfully a few of those wins managed to turn a small bag into a decent multiplier. Let's hope those little now worth nothing "moon bags" also get alive again during a full out bull market.

**Let's switch gears for a bit, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? what are your hobbies?**

Outside of the crypto, apart from the casual travels I‚Äôve been getting back into a passion that is filming. It started with just picking up the camera a few weeks back, but it‚Äôs quickly brought back that excitement I used to feel capturing the world in my own way. It gives me an excuse as well to zone out of the normal daily busy life.

**Any alpha or advice that you can give us? It can be anything.**

Do not overthink it, in case 2025 is bullish (4 year cycle), take profits when you feel euphoric.

**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, yielddaddy? The stage is yours!**

Crypto lets us become sovereign individuals in the digital age, onboard and teach others whenever you can, we are winning.

*Edge City Lanna Week 1*

-----

I checked in to [Edge City Lanna](https://www.edgecity.live/lanna) in Chiang Mai last Sunday, so somehow it's been nearly a whole week already! Time flies. I thought this would be a good opportunity to provide an update given that there's a very clear dividing line in my schedule: I had lots of flexibility to do various Edge City things this last week, but next week will be much more structured and technical. So it's a good time to summarize the experience so far. Whopper of a post today.

First, the *broad strokes*.

As I mentioned before, Edge City is a popup village, a descendant of sorts from Zuzalu, where a bunch of people have come to live and work in a small neighborhood in Chiang Mai for up to a month. The central themes, as listed on their website, are human organization, AI, real-world crypto, health/longevity, and hard tech. It's easy to paint over it with broad strokes to say "it's kind of Ethereum-adjacent tech and culture stuff", but I have been quite impressed with the extent to which it is really interdisciplinary.

Probably half of the people I've met have their focus outside of blockchain/web3 (often they're exploring if we can provide tools to help with their own endeavors), and it's really cool to have gathered all these different people in one place. Meeting new people and hearing the breadth of their backgrounds has been one of my favorite parts of my time here. I have also seen a number of familiar faces (some from here as well--hi!), and expect more to make it for the last week before Devcon.

[Cursive](https://www.cursive.team/) put together NFC wristbands for everyone to make it easy to share contact info, build a connection graph, and use ZK proofs to find common interests and discussion topics without just revealing each person's whole list to each other. RadicalxChange has a local currency, [Edges](https://lannaedges.radicalxchange.org/), intended to be used to pay for personal services or perishable goods specifically within Edge City. These get... a little use. Telegram, the Thai Baht, and good old fashioned "what do you do?" still remain the ultimate coordination tools.

------

*Programming*

There are only a few events that are truly Edge City first-party official. Daily communal breakfasts and lunches, big Sunday dinners, weekly project demo days, and a few others. Each week there are a number of major featured events and a few central multi-day tracks, organized somewhat independently but with a degree of Edge City sponsorship/promotion.

This last week we had talks and workshops on stablecoins and governance games. There's an ongoing multi-day "existential hope worldbuilding" series, and today there's a full-day AI x Neuro event. But generally anyone has the freedom to schedule an event, book a room in one of the shared buildings, and be just as "official" as anyone else.

As such there is a *lot* of flexibility in how you structure your day. I like to sign up for anything that sounds interesting, which means I spend most of each day in The-A-Ter, our lecture hall of sorts, and otherwise bouncing around to wherever fun and weird stuff is going on. Other people have made heavy use of the coworking space to get some building done. Others can dive into the wellness angle and focus on taking care of themselves for a while, or use Edge City as a home base to explore Chiang Mai and find others to get out with.

--------

*My Experience*

I started off with what I thought was a pretty balanced schedule. I'd eat breakfast at the hotel, do a bit of yoga or something, spend an hour or two in the coworking space, then attend talks and workshops most of the rest of the day with a communal lunch break at some point. Maybe a cold plunge and sauna in the late afternoon, followed by dinner and a quiet evening back at the hotel. There is a whole world of more lively evening events (raves out in the woods?) that I tend to skip--not really my thing.

I caught a fairly minor cold that messed with my morning routine for a few days (sleeping in more, skipping the workout), but feeling better now and need to re-establish some structure there. Currently recovering from an ankle injury that I should avoid putting high impact on, so without my go-to sport of running I have to be a little more creative, but there are plenty of options here.

Here's a sampler of the sort of events I've been going to:

* Weekly community demo days intended to showcase work that's being done here now. Mostly your usual suite of Ethereumy projects, with perhaps a focus on Edge City themes. [ZK Email](https://prove.email/) had some neat updates since I'd last checked in, one example being a side-event at Devcon that you can only get into if you provide a zk proof that you received a rejection email for a Devcon speaker application.
* Did a few days of yoga, never even tried it before. I still don't necessarily get the full picture, but it seems like a good combination of strength and flexibility exercises, with an element of just aiming for loosening up and feeling good. Less regimented than my usual workouts but I guess that's the point.
* Someone was working on a video game, wanted playtesters, and cared enough to create a scheduled time to try it out. So sure, why not.
* Attended an evening talk on consciousness and the speaker's idea of [vasocomputation](https://opentheory.net/2023/07/principles-of-vasocomputation-a-unification-of-buddhist-phenomenology-active-inference-and-physical-reflex-part-i/). I'm skeptical, but fun to get a little out there occasionally.
* Stablecoin track: Discussions around recoverability (would you opt-in to a system where a trusted admin could revert a transfer?), yield-bearing stables, vitalik advocating for decentralized stablecoins, a confidential ERC-20 standard, temporary approvals, etc. Breakout sessions after each day to discuss topics in groups of ~5.
* Learned about a method for collective evaluation of contributions to a community via pairwise comparisons. Potentially applicable to allocation of value to public goods.
* A short session where someone just wanted to talk with like-minded people about packing light for the digital nomad life. I got to show off my ~30L pack setup that holds everything I need for this month.
* An informal session to chat about different views on longevity research, trying to bridge the gap a little between the longevity focused people who think "death-ists" are ignorant, and the folks from outside the space who think the longevity people are out of touch.

------

*Conclusion*

It's probably fair to ask if Edge City is worth the costs. Long expensive plane flights, paying for lodging here, and the ticket itself (0.45 ETH for two weeks), in exchange for a hard-to-value social setting. You *can* get work done, but to what extent are all the events and people running around useful vs being a distraction from actual productive work? It does sometimes feel like at conferences there's a lot of "oh we should collaborate on something"... with an implied "when we're done here and get back to the real world", which often doesn't happen. But the right serendipitous connection in the right place at the right time could be super valuable too, and the massive breadth of people here makes it feel ripe for finding new insights. I don't have a good answer at this point.

Tomorrow begins a series of technical events that were the original reason for me to sign up for Edge City. Sequencing Week, mainly, which is a get-together of 50-60 people working on sequencing--as it pertains to the sequence of transactions in L1 and L2 blocks, who determines it, and how. Shared/based sequencing and preconfirmations are the main keywords. And before that, tomorrow is Interop Day--as it pertains to interoperability between L1 and L2 chains. I don't expect to be quite so useful at Interop Day, but if the conversation strays towards shared sequencing as a tool to improve interop, then Aestus as a neutral infrastructure provider becomes relevant again.

These events are going to require more of a time commitment, so I will have less freedom to do miscellaneous Edge City things. Hopefully this will be a good chance to really sit down and *do* something collaborative and impactful. And hopefully I can still get exposure to the broader Edge City topics at shared meals and a handful of evening events.

As usual I would be happy to explain more about certain points here. There's a lot going on and a lot of ways to think about it.

I wanna kickstart a fun discussion!

So far, ever since you started playing around with _blockchain_ in general. What are the top 3 things you have done, that when you did them you thought "wow that was cool". Finance related, or not.

I'll start:

1. First swapping and pooling assets on Uniswap
2. First ever taking an Aave loan to buy a gift card with the loaned assets
3. Using ENS names to designate where I want to be paid (and vice versa) while buying/selling assets to and from other users in a trust-based way (based on reviews of them posted by other users on a community-maintained telegram channel)

<summary>u/Vandelay101 has a take on the current state of web 3 gaming</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gk03k8/daily_general_discussion_november_5_2024/lvk269s/)

Web3 gaming was one sector I was looking forward to having a breakout year. It still may, but I'm now thinking it will be over a longer time horizon. It just seems like the space is maturing at a snail's pace. Seeing a AAA studio, even if it's Ubisoft (oh, how the mighty have fallen), launch their first "NFT game" and receive so much backlash is not all that surprising...

But what stands out to me is that Web3 gaming is still being wholesale branded and reported on as "NFT games". That phrase just carries a bad connotation to me, as it implies that players are already somehow burdened with collectibles and/or have to spend currency on in-game marketplace assets in order to remain competitive. Perhaps the space deserves the unflattering branding, at least for now... Game developers get greedy and, as their first foray into on-chain gaming, adopt a pay-to-play / pay-to-win model. Over time, though, creativity will shine through... We'll begin to see developers adopt models tailored specifically to Web3 gaming platforms that empower the player without creating the unnecessary friction that the old guard has made all too commonplace. 

Right now it seems like we're only in the early discovery phase of this space's potential. The big-name game developers have only dipped their toes into Web3 gaming thus far, dedicating only a small fraction of the resources as they would to a traditional AAA title launch. But they don't want to be caught with their pants down, however, in case Web3 becomes the future of gaming... So they throw a few bucks at a "NFT game" concept, build a few relations here and there with companies that can onboard them, and call it a day.

My hope is that game developers are able to navigate past NFTs serving as the focal point in the majority of Web3 game designs, and get to a point where they're exploring fresh concepts while keep the players' best interests at heart (fun, immersion, etc.). I'm starting to believe the first hit to really take the Web3 gaming sector by storm will come from a smaller indie developer who adopts a model that is unique in how it leverages the advantages of being built on a borderless, trustless, decentralized network.

Admittedly, I haven't done much research on this topic... Just throwing out some loose observations and ramblings.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency checks in on Solana and u/growthepie_eth provides some important context</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gk03k8/daily_general_discussion_november_5_2024/lvjr8dd/)

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

As always, I apologize for solanaposting, especially on such an anxious day for many. But I think responses to this might help me better understand ETH.

If we look at the DefiLlama fees, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour fee revenue.

https://defillama.com/fees

Yes, I believe this doesn't include L2 revenue, but L2 revenue translates only indirectly to L1 revenue anyways. And yes, I'm aware that it's only been for a couple of days - Ethereum is still looking much stronger on the monthly/yearly.

If we take a SOL staking yield of 6% (from stakingrewards.com) and an inflation rate of 4.9% (from solanacompass.com), that means SOL staking has a real yield of 1.1% (no idea if these sources are accurate but they seem reasonable enough). I am aware that this ignores the upcoming token unlocks for VC dumping, but while the dumping could affect price, I don't believe it should affect real yield (which could be accessed then, after the dumping).

Q's:

1. Is this data accurate?

2. Is it possible that Solana could pass up ETH in monthly fee revenue, then fee revenue in general?

3. Can any old schmo forever access this risk-free yield just by staking like on Ethereum, or are there some special Solana strings attached (aside from the usual disadvantages of the Solana chain itself)?

3. Does this fee revenue comparison matter at all? What should I make of it? I feel like the most important property that ETH has over other tokens is a real staking yield (ETH's credible neutrality is up there, too).

[u/growthepie_eth](https://reddit.com/u/growthepie_eth):

1) I can only speak on Ethereum data and it looks to be correct I would add the following context:  

- Using a 7 day rolling Avg Ethereum fee revenue = $3.29M (yesterday's rolling Avg)   
- If we were to also include Layer 2s this would be $3.57M  
- Ethereum has proved it can remain secure and keep demand with lower issuance (subsidy) this shouldn't be taken for granted on other chains.   
- The Blob market is very new and is only just starting to generate revenue and this will change over time.   


2) Anything is possible Solana is subsidizing fees with higher issuance in an attempt to gain more revenue whilst also having different security assumptions on decentralization. Ethereum blobs have really taken the wind out of those sails by allowing L2s to compete and beat them on transaction costs. Ethereum has sacrificed revenue in the short term as we enter the growth stage for L2s this will enable them to grow faster without having to dramatically increase issuance - this is a long-term play. 

3) I think with Solana they use DPOS so you're delegating rather than self staking and to be a delegate you have to have super expensive hardware and bandwidth. So different risk profile but yes anyone can get access to the yield don't I know how much yield the delegate keeps?

4) I think it does matter but is far from the only thing that matters -  ETH being used as a unit of account on all these L2s and many of them charge their users in ETH all play into ETHs use and value (not financial advice)

It is built on the Taiko stack, will be stage 2 at launch, uses ETH as token and they plan to have a Gigagas throughput. This is about 700 times more throughput than mainnet. They will not be able to achieve that with the current number of blobs, but I guess that is their goal in the future.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gkrnmn/daily_general_discussion_november_6_2024/lvotkmp/)

*The year is 203X, after failing to manage the deficit, the US government has defaulted on its debts by printing it away. Inflation is unsurprisingly out of control.*

Person 1: I really wish the government managed the deficit better. This inflation is insane!

Person 2: [Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos!](https://youtu.be/Q8hDsIoEFYw)

*Kodos's policies would have also lead to inflation. The US government is already past the point of no return because any politician voted in who is willing to implement the austerity required to get the budget back on track would be swiftly voted out. The game theory says it is no longer possible. Do not get left holding the fiat bag.*

<summary>u/benido2030 provides us with a ZKSync delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gkrnmn/daily_general_discussion_november_6_2024/lvp5lma/)

So yesterday u/phimarhal tagged me to show support for [TPP1](https://forum.zknation.io/t/draft-tpp-zksync-ignite-program-the-ignite-program/168), which is the first proposal in the zksync ecosystem. Voting opened yesterday. I indeed will be voting FOR, but this is not the reason for this post. I wanna share my experience and thoughts being a first-time-delegate. 

The TPP is called "zksync Ignite Program". Their one sentence summary is

>Allocate 325,000,000 ZK tokens over nine months to deploy a program designed to establish a DeFi liquidity hub on ZKsync Era, aimed at increasing DeFi TVL and improving liquidity across all interoperable ZK Chains (‚ÄùElastic Chain‚Äù).

So it's about mining/ attracting liquidity by handing out ZK incentives in various defi protocols. The proposal is not reinventing the wheel here, it's similar to STIP/LTIP you might know from Arbitrum. 

At the same time TPPs are supposed to be different. zksync (not the delegates) presented TPPs in a way where things are supposed to be as automatic and onchain as possible. Instead of giving out grants/ incentives to protocols, TPPs are supposed to be "autonomous token allocation processes". If you are really interested in this, please see these two threads in the forum, the [TPP FAQ](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-frequently-asked-questions/141) and then this [presentation](https://forum.zknation.io/t/token-programmes-as-a-path-towards-a-true-cybernetic-governance-framework/142). 

I think the idea is beautiful, even if I still have issues to *really* understand how this is supposed to work onchain. Here comes the twist... TPP1 is not even remotely close to being automatic. The whole program is a lot of manual work. And - as we later found out - was/ is a project that the zksync team supports, I guess it was design with them and there's a lot of support for it. Despite being... the opposite of what they told us the TPPs are supposed to be. 

I found the proposal cause I follow zknation and zksync on twitter. [This](https://x.com/TheZKNation/status/1846929270133633384) is the tweet and as you can see zksync Ignite had a twitter account, created before the proposal was even published. The zksync twitter account even states the following:

>ZKsync Ignite will turn ZKsync Era into a liquidity hub for the Elastic Chain by streaming 300M ZK tokens over 9 months to DeFi users.

So it... will? Or could? 

Also the first comment in the TPP thread in the forum was created minutes after publishing it, the account posting it was created the same day, until today it has been in the forum 2 days, less than 1 minute of total reading time. But was super supportive. 

If you are still with me, I apologize, cause I am just starting and know this is already a wall of text, thank you for your patience and still reading!

<summary>Shitpost of the week: u/cryptOwOcurrency</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gg7smg/comment/luqa2uc/)

Since lately it seems like chains with less technology pump more, I suggest we remove some technology from Ethereum. Roll back 1559, go back to PoW... actually we could get rid of the blockchain aspect altogether, since nobody seems to care. We could run it in a SQL database. Or we could even get rid of the ledger altogether. Ethereum would be a system of IOUs, an unstoppable concept, with n-of-n decentralization in the minds of its true believers.

Everyone should write down how much ETH they have before we get rid of the blockchain. Write them onto little pieces of paper with denominations on them. DO NOT create any more paper than you actually owned in ETH. PLEASE, that's very important. Then as a replacement for smart contracts, we will talk about what should happen if something happens, and then you shake hands. You NEED to honor every agreement you shook on. If everyone promises to do that, this might just work.

This plan flips the script on Bitcoin, because now Ethereum has the fewest amount of moving parts. Now Ethereum is the most dependable. If something has no code, it can't have bugs in it. If something has no development, its roadmap cannot be compromised. If something is only an idea, it cannot be shut down.

In other words, the Ethereum Foundation touts its "philosophy of subtraction", but does it really walk the walk? I challenge them to dream smaller.

<summary>u/interweaver explains how Ethereum's fee markets work</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gbml3v/daily_general_discussion_october_25_2024/ltojfr2/)

Just a quick recap on how fee markets work in Ethereum (both for blockspace and for blobspace):

There's a base fee, which represents the current "state" of the fee market. That base fee sets how much a unit of gas costs (for normal transactions, which use blockspace, and disregarding tips) or how much a blob costs. 

There's also a target amount of resource usage: for normal transactions, that's the target gas (15M units of gas), which is half of the max gas per block (30M), and for blobs it's currently 3 blobs (out of a maximum of 6).

Each block, the *actual* resource usage (gas or blobs) ends up being some number 0 <= amount <= max, which will be either greater than, equal to, or less than, the target for that resource. 

Here's the important part: if the resource usage is *greater than* the target (e.g. 20M gas used, which is greater than the 15M target, or 5 blobs instead of the target 3), *the next block the basefee/blob fee for that resource will be higher by a certain percentage*. The opposite also applies; if the resource usage is *less than* the target, the basefee/blob fee will decrease by a certain percentage. 

It's actually kind of genius; this means that Ethereum's fees automatically adjust to demand. 

If there's **high demand**, aka more users willing to pay higher gas fees for normal transactions, or more L2s willing to pay higher blob fees for blob-carrying transactions, then you would expect to see usage exceed the targets, and the next block will have higher fees, until the fees become too much and the demand (at that fee level) comes back to the target. 

If there's **low demand**, in theory the opposite occurs: it indicates the resource is currently overpriced relative to supply and demand, and so the next block will have a cheaper basefee/blob fee, hopefully encouraging more usage in order to meet the target. This has worked out well for gas fees, because Ethereum has *plenty* of pent-up demand for transactions that are willing to wait for cheap gas; there's never a lack of transactions ready to be submitted when basefees lower. 

However, I said "in theory" because blob fees are in a different situation currently. The mechanism works the same as with the basefee, but L2s are currently not creating enough demand for blobspace the large majority of the time. This means that even when blobfees are extremely cheap (the minimum it can go to, 1 wei per blob), there's simply not enough blobs being submitted for the average block to meet its blob target (3 blobs), and if you'll recall, this means that the blob fee would continue to go down in the next block, except that it's pinned at the minimum. 

So observe this highly binary situation: either there *is* enough demand for a resource, at all times, that Ethereum can always make sure it's on average meeting its target usage for that resource, or there *is not*. Block gas currently has enough demand; blobs currently do not. And observe what this means for fees: if there *is* enough demand for the resource, the fee will stay floating at some fair market rate, much greater than 0, and Ethereum can collect (and burn) those fees. But if there *is not* enough demand, the fee will bottom out at ~0 and stay there, except during occasional spikes in demand. That's where we're at with blobs right now.

And crucially, observe **that this is a switch that can and will flip itself at some point in the future**, when blob demand from L2s and other users increases past a critical threshold, namely 3 blobs per 12 seconds. Once the average demand exceeds that, Ethereum will instantly enter a regime where blob pricing needs to follow market rates, rather than being pinned at 0.

And as we all know, L2s are very insensitive to blob pricing. During recent blob fee spikes, we saw certain L2s paying *absurd* prices for their blobs, think multiple Ether for each blob. This is likely due to them not putting appropriate limits/waits in place, but it illustrates the point: L2s, with their high 'compression ratios' of L2 transactions to L1 commit transactions, are able to pay *much* higher fees than ordinary transactions on L1 are. 

So putting it all together: blob fees will be 0, until suddenly they are *very much not 0* when demand for blobs passes a certain threshhold.

And L2 growth over the past year has been fairly exponential. We *will* pass that threshold in the near future (potentially delayed somewhat if we raise the blob target in Pectra, albeit.)

All the handwringing about how Ethereum is not capturing value from its L2s will seem like a very silly concern not too long from now, in other words.

<summary>u/HSuke warns us of a US crypto tax rule change</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gbml3v/daily_general_discussion_october_25_2024/ltozg9l/)

[Fairly significant US crypto tax rule change](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gbvgu1/revenue_procedure_202428_what_you_need_to_know/):

> Effective January 1, 2025, ALL taxpayers will be required to track cost basis at the **wallet level**. In other words, if you have ETH in Wallet A and ETH in Wallet B, and then you sell some ETH in Wallet B, you cannot pull the cost basis from Wallet A

So each wallet is treated as a separate tax bucket

Also discussed [here](https://blog.cryptoworth.com/how-revenue-procedure-2024-28-changes-crypto-accounting-and-what-you-need-to-know/)

Edit: This ONLY applies to FIFO. Most of you who transfer assets between wallets/accounts will likely not be able to use FIFO or use Specific ID (based on my limited understanding of this). Honestly, my accounts will be in a bit of a mess and probably cannot use FIFO due to this rule.

<summary>u/TheHansGruber talks staking with NodeSet and RocketPool</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gcdmiv/daily_general_discussion_october_26_2024/ltwh8ln/)

About an hour ago I had the privilege to launch my first NodeSet validator. There are over 500 now, and the limit per operator has just been increased from 4 to 5. I'll have to wait 24 hours give or take to launch my second, but as long as these big deposits keep flowing in, I will keep launching minipools. It may seem farfetched now, but operators running 100+ minipools each is not out of the question. Adoption can happen fast.

BTW, these ops are sharks...there is a script floating around that checks the pool for deposits and if gas is favorable will automatically launch another minipool. I launched mine manually but am in the process of setting the script up for myself as well. 

The rocketpool deposit pool, which has been bloated for the last several months (and been a drag on rETH APR) has been cut in half in two weeks. And xrETH hasn't even been integrated into defi at all. Really proud to be playing a small part in this fine group of operators.

On top of that, the Saturn 0 upgrade that's coming in a few days is going to further reduce the deposit pool as new minipools will lose the RPL requirement.

Basically, it's been a nice little Saturday. Ignoring the FUD, watching Vitamin B go ham on shitposters, launching 'pools. I got my database and GUI up and running on my little project. Blops 6 released, and they brought back round based zombies (which is the only way to do it, imo) and the I'm lovin' the 90's aesthetic. Might go for some ice cream later, who knows?

Ticker is ETH.

<summary>u/waqwaqattack introduces us to tomorrow's big RocketPool upgrade</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gcdmiv/daily_general_discussion_october_26_2024/ltvcmyj/)

Rocket Pool is upgrading to Saturn 0 tomorrow (Sunday night, 8pm Eastern time). The upgrade will allow people to stake with Rocket Pool without requiring any RPL bond - ETH only validators are here! Part of this upgrade is that existing node operators will start earning RPL rewards again. 

I recorded a special episode of Rocket Fuel with Samus, one of the RP community members who was involved in researching the upgrade. You can watch it [here https://youtu.be/q0EoHRuCi3g](https://youtu.be/q0EoHRuCi3g). In the episode, Samus explains the reason for this upgrade as part of the official Saturn roadmap. He gives information on what rewards for ETH only validators will be - 1.3x solo staking rewards, how everyone will get RPL rewards from next month, and his ideas on the impact will have on Rocket Pool's growth. 

The Rocket Pool deposit pool has been in an overflow state for months, but that is going to change this week. If you want to mint rETH directly from the Rocket Pool contract, you will have that chance again from Monday onwards. 

If you are an existing node operator with 16 eth validators, you can switch to LEB8s for an immediate boost in rewards - without needing to add a single RPL token. If you have any questions, please let me know, and I'll answer them here. 

Are you ready to join us, u/cryptomoon2020! The water's warm. Get in the pool!

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard finished his Rabbit Hole Explorer's Guide</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gd4es8/daily_general_discussion_october_27_2024/lu35fn6/)

Finally I'm at the end of my [Rabbit Hole Explorer's Guide](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fzjust/daily_general_discussion_october_9_2024/lr60i0j/) and boy has that been a journey.

**Recommended First Steps**

Up until now I've covered a frighteningly lengthy sequence of things not to do and ways you can lose everything. To conclude let's focus on what should you do to get started? What's in your metaphorical backpack so you can be prepared like a good little boy scout? Where should you go exploring first?

**Curate Your Feed**

Generally speaking my feed consists of three things:

1) Project introductions. This is mostly YouTube for me. My list changes over time but has included Bankless, Bell Curve, and some much smaller accounts like Jordan McKinney. This type of content is often very biased so don't expect too much from it besides background context on the project, what they are doing and how it's novel, and the bull case. They usually aren't going to compare themselves to their peers here or tell you how the project might fail. This will give you a list of things to research more deeply.

2) Official announcements. I check my Discord/Telegram announcement feed every morning, build up a list of tabs, and clear it by the end of the day. Sometimes I'll hear about new projects from partnership announcements.

3) Discussion. This is where people get into the most trouble. Don't let a social media tech giant direct your learning. Price of a project being shilled (especially on short horizons) is a terrible metric for the quality of a source. You might think to follow technology leaders but without enough background you're as likely to start following Charles Hoskinson or Richard Heart as Vitalik Buterin. They all sound convincing to the uninitiated. What I recommend is rather than look for technical or wealthy people to instead look for project experts other than the team members that post about an application or ecosystem you already understand. You need to be able make sense of what is being said and make an informed decision about whether they are saying it in an intellectually honest way. Personally, I'll also actively talk with community managers and members of projects but I'm looking for much deeper information or collaboration opportunities. You're never going to find a Microsoft dev to ask question to but you very well might find and ask questions directly to a project founder in web3.

The more you fill your feed with people who are only interested in price the less happy you'll be. The more impatient you are to get rich quick, the more money will slip through your fingers and the more you're going to be spending on therapy and blood pressure meds. Instead fill your feed with information worth knowing and spreading.

**Hands On Learning**

Undoubtedly the best way to explore the Rabbit Hole is to go there yourself. As I hopefully gotten across by now, focus on survival. Learn with small amounts to limit the liability of beginners mistakes. Start with stablecoins where you can to avoid price volatility risks. Start with older projects and projects with higher TVL because they tend to be safer. Start with simpler applications. In an attempt to be helpful getting you started here is a bunch of things to search out yourself sorted into categories by relevance to you and then roughly by approachability and importance. There's a lot of editorial discretion here and you can be sure this is incomplete and will be out of date.

*Defi*

1) Money markets such as Aave and Compound

2) Dexs such as Uniswap and Curve

3) Liquidity incentives/farming such as bribes, bonds, marketing, points

4) Leverage such as Gearbox, Defisaver, or GMX

5) Options such as Lyra, Hegic

6) Real world asset protocols such as Centrifuge and Maker

7) Regen finance such as Gitcoin Grants, Greenpill, and Klima

*Digital Identity*

1) Ethereum Name Service (ENS), basically a human readable address

2) Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Let anyone prove that you or someone else claimed something.

3) Sybil resistance systems such as WorldCoin, BrightID, Proof of Humanity

4) Achievements such as Rabbit Hole or Layer3

*NFTs* 

1) Communities such as Bored Apes or EVMavericks

2) RWAs such as Get Protocol

3) Corporate NFTs such as Nike and Starbucks

*Gaming*

1) Auto battlers such as Axie Infinity and Illuvium Arena

2) Strategy games such as InfluenceETH and Illuvium Zero

*Memecoins*

1) Doge, Bonk, Wif, etc. I'll mark this cavern with a skull and crossbones.

*Depin*

1) Restaking such as EigenLayer, Symbiotic, and Karak.

2) Oracles such as Chainlink, UMA, and EOracle

3) Keepers such as Keeper Network and Gelato

4) Data availability such as EigenDA and Celestia

5) Compute sharing systems such as Golem and Spheron

6) AI in various forms such as Ritual, BitTensor s19, etc

*Enterprise*

1) Logistics systems such as Nightfall

2) Proof of Authority chains

*Foundational Tech*

1) Rollup technology such as Blobs, Validiums, and Fraud Proofs

2) Scaling Technology such as Verkle Trees and Proposer Builder Separation

3) Privacy Technology such as TEE, FHE, MPC

**Review Prior Scams**

After every hack you'll find a post-mortem. You should bookmark these when you find them and swing by every once in awhile as you level up until one day it clicks. Occasionally you'll even find useful summaries like [this one](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1eer8s9/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2024/lfigqox/) that infodump many of these in one place. Eventually you'll know what jargon like reentrancy guards are. You learn a lot about how things work by how things break.

**Conclusion**

Over time if you follow the advice here you'll know more than 99% of Crypto Twitter on a good variety of topics, you'll be able to take measured and deliberate risks, and you'll fall into communities that share your values. You'll probably meet some of these people in person at conferences. You may end up getting a job here. You may end up not needing a job at all. You'll definitely find sources of joy and points of light in an otherwise dark world. Whatever happens, you will be changed in ways you aren't expecting. I hope you'll come away a better, happier, and wealthier person.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gd4es8/daily_general_discussion_october_27_2024/lu0lw7i/)

After the Merge I started looking into staking, but the only internet options at the time weren't great and I don't have a tech background / had never used CLI etc. I saw several posts talking about how anyone can do it but really didn't think that could apply to me. I looked at the SomerEsat guides and they looked very thorough but I quickly became overwhelmed.

Well, fiber internet without a data cap was installed in our neighborhood and I decided it was time (and was worried that Allnodes would be cost prohibitive with Saturn 1 for Rocket Pool allowing for 4 ETH validators). People in the Rocket Pool #hardware channel helped me find an appropriate setup and following the RP guides I was able to get up and running on Holesky Testnet. My questions in the #support channel were answered within minutes.

Now I am on Mainnet and I am obsessed with starting at my Grafana dashboard! The SmartNode stack is super helpful for someone like me that only had a vague understanding of what Linux even was.

If you have have been on the fence about running your own node, it really is possible! For me the Rocket Pool community has been a great help and I also found answers in the EthStaker community.

This started when I first attended ETHDenver, and I generally just attended talks all day every day, took notes, and summarized my favorites. Now that I'm [more involved](https://aestus.live) on a day-to-day basis, my conference activities have become a bit more varied and I find that if you're already in the loop, conference talks tend to just repeat info that's available in more detail elsewhere.

But I still like to report on the talks that I find interesting, and can always find topics I'm less familiar with if I just step away from the MEV talks for a minute. Regardless of technical content, I also like to convey a little bit of what these events feel like to attend, for anyone who may be interested in the future. And finally, I hope to encourage ethfinanciers to be the change they want to see in the sub: the sorts of summaries I write are the sort of content I also enjoy consuming here, and I'd always like to see more of it.

So today I thought I'd hit on the broader Ethereum event structure. You see, I just arrived in Thailand and will be here for *nearly a month* doing Ethereum stuff. If you really want to you can structure your whole life around bouncing from tangentially-Ethereum-related event to tangentially-Ethereum-related event. Some people do just that, and would be better qualified to explain that lifestyle, but I think I'm getting a taste of it here. So I'll give a bit of an overview of what I'm looking at in Thailand.

-------

To start off, I am in Chiang Mai for the last two weeks of [Edge City](https://www.edgecity.live/about) [Lanna](https://www.edgecity.live/lanna). There are a lot of different potential lenses through which to look at Edge City, but in general it is a month-long *popup village* where attendees all live in the same neighborhood in Chiang Mai, with a number of buildings rented out to serve as communal coworking, dining, social, wellness, and learning spaces. It creates a bit of a university campus feeling. There's lots of room for flexibly structuring your day with some combination of your own work and shared workshops/classes, with infrastructure in place to help you eat well, socialize, and keep your body and mind healthy. That description leaves a lot in the air for what people actually *do* there, but it's generally web3/Ethereum (+longevity/AI/network-state/health/etc) focused: we have tracks on stablecoins and governance this week, and next week I'll be diving into Sequencing Week to focus on based sequencing and preconfirmations.

Then I fly down to Bangkok. Shortly before Devcon I am attending the [Staking Summit](https://lu.ma/stakingsummit24). I went to their event last year in Istanbul and thought it was interesting enough to attend again. The core audience is really institutional staking-as-a-service providers, and a lot of people there see staking as just like a financial product that gives yield, and don't really care about the underlying protocols. But they offered a steep discount to home stakers so I expect to see some friendly faces there, and I can always chat with validators about their thoughts on timing games, MEV, commitments/preconfs, and so on. If it turns out to be boring, well, I could probably use a few days off.

Then comes [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/) proper. I guess there's still no concrete schedule, but there are four main days on the calendar. A number of side events too, which for the most part come in the days before Devcon or in the evenings after Devcon days. I'm signed up for far too many sequencing events and expect to be thoroughly bored of the subject by the end. For Devcon I intend to be in full conference mode, attending talks and writing up my usual summaries.

Finally comes Hodlercon in Phuket. This is the one place on the internet where Hodlercon needs no particular explanation. I expect to treat Hodlercon kind of like Edge City, aiming for a mix of learning, socializing, and leading for a healthy lifestyle. But of course it's going to be more personal, even less structured, and more vacation-y. The planner that the team has been working with has... not been particularly impressive so far. But as long as we get our hotel rooms confirmed and we can all make it to Phuket together, we can always work out the rest.

-------

That's a lot of time in Thailand! And plenty to do. I think I'm going to be very glad to get back to a cool climate after a long, tropical month.

So I'll give my thoughts on Edge City once it's done, and will report on Staking Summit if it's interesting enough to warrant the posts. Devcon gets daily updates for sure, Hodlercon maybe gets one summary at the end. In the meantime, Edge City provides plenty of opportunity for focused work time, and I think it may be time to write up a primer on based sequencing and preconfs intended for the solo+home staker audience. I think there are even writing clinics here where I can get some feedback first. Anyone else visiting can feel free to reach out whenever!

<summary>u/unthinkablecryto is thinking about the next killer app</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gdv8ez/daily_general_discussion_october_28_2024/lu8sz4f/)

The Bridge acquisition by Stripe has really got me thinking where this space, particularly for ETH is headed. It's becoming pretty obvious to me that payments across the world will start moving on-chain. This is smart-contracts and blockchains killer use case I believe at least for the next 10 years. But these will primarily done in USD for now. Stablecoins are in the top 20 for holders of US debt worldwide. I believe on bankless they said that above 95% of all stablecoins are USD. Stablecoins are exporting USD to the world, only making it stronger, and the war on inflation, is all but won for now, so everyone feels pretty good about USD.
   
But there is still the elephant in the room that is our rising debt. I love reading this article ( https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels )by the School of Wharton last year saying that we have basically have 20 years to turn things around. This is why no really cares about ETH or BTC as money (I mean I do) but the average person thinks well I have the USD now available to me, which has low inflation again, and I have 20 years before I need to worry about exiting USD. Its not even on their radar right now replacing USD.
    
So USD stablecoin use rise in countries that have inflation, we have already seen this on Tron, and exchange to exchange wallets.
    
What brings on everyone else on-chain? Merchants and banks will love the settlement time of blockchains but for most users credit cards are already a great experience, and people love the rewards. I think this starts as a grass led movement where independent merchants incentivize users to pay on-chain directly with discounts and tokens/NFTs (some of which will have utility). Coinbase seems to be the leader behind this with their wallet and best in class Base experience (paying gas fees in USDC, covering transfer fees, and their SDKs/APIs) (though Stripe could really compete here, I remember the explosive growth of the headphone jack iPhone card reader).
   
Beyond that we really need a privacy solution (likely ZK, plus a regulated compliance framework) for general banking I believe. Credit Card companies will likely move on chain in the background too, but the average person won't know tap to pay with phones and cards will still be common place. And they will mainly be doing it to reduce their fees, and settlement times as well, they will likely still charge the same take rate until they are forced to lower it from competition from people making payments directly. Got to keep the reward train rolling somehow. 
   
Opportunities for investment I am looking for 1) incentive programs for payments ( I doubt every merchant will create their own from scratch) 2) useable directory of businesses that take stablecoins, (Incentives here for being listed/accepting?) 3) compliance enabled privacy. I think Base / Coinbase dominate in the short term but then as fragmentation issues get cleaned up L2s in general dominate these payments because of the SDKs and developers behind ETH. ETH price will do well with increased usage but look to see major increases in price for ETH for monetary premium in 10 years if the US does nothing to address debts. Until then we need usage and real payments. The user experience seems like it's ready, now it's about making people want to accept and to pay on-chain, and clean up the bad image that crypto is all a scam.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency introduces us to indistinguishability obfuscation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gent1b/daily_general_discussion_october_29_2024/lufr83e/)

I knew about zero knowledge proofs and fully-homomorphic encryption already, but **indistinguishability obfuscation** is an insane new cryptography primitive I'd never heard of before.

Basically, iO lets you encrypt a program in such a way that someone can run it, but can never figure out the program's internals no matter how hard they try to analyze/decompile the program.

More on iO, according to Vitalik:

> While it's still very far from maturity, as of 2020 we have theoretically valid protocols for it based on standard security assumptions, and work is recently starting on implementations. Indistinguishability obfuscation lets you create an "encrypted program" that performs an arbitrary computation, in such a way that all internal details of the program are hidden. As a simple example, you can put a private key into an obfuscated program which only lets you use it to sign prime numbers, and distribute this program to other people. They can use the program to sign any prime number, but cannot take the key out. But it's far more powerful than that: together with hashes, it can be used to implement any other cryptographic primitive, and more.

My understanding is that with FHE and iO combined, theoretically someone could create a program that operates on encrypted data, where the program is itself encrypted. And both the program and the data remain encrypted during the entire operation. So the program and data are both protected from the computer that is running it and storing it.

Further reading [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indistinguishability_obfuscation).

Math is crazy!

Edit: And if I understand it properly, it's gonna be insane for DRM!

Shout out to u/epic_trader for pushing back on the misinformation and false narratives on r/cc.

And a reminder for anyone with an interest in this space to take a look over there and in /ethereum periodically to provide some insights and sanity to discussions if you have any to spare. 

There's a lot of nonsense spread by Bitcoin maxis; /buttcoin moderators; and alt-L1 bagholders, and if you don't want them controlling the narrative on Ethereum then you can be the change you want to see.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

To give a bit of context.

They used D-Waves quantum annealer which normally are not called quantum computers as they use a different principle. Generally these quantum annealers can only solve a very narrow set of optimization problems. When people talk about cracking cryptography they always refer to proper quantum computers for which for example Shor's algorithm has been developed. And to the best of my knowledge no one has a quantum computer to run Shor's algorithm even for the smallest of RSA key lengths.

The Chinese group found a way to use such a quantum annealer optimization to help to factorize a 50 bit RSA integer. Nowadays RSA key length should be at least 2048 bits long and normally should be 4096 bits long. To the best of my knowledge, the longest RSA key that has been cracked a few years ago was 829 bits long. Classical computer are still far ahead. 

As far as I see the paper itself has been published in a very niche journal which not really solidifies the credibility of their approach as the review process in many of these journals is severely lacking. Even more so than in established journals.

As far as I see the results are viewed negatively. See here for example for a more in depth discussion: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2024/10/16/department-of-anti-hype-no-china-hasnt-broken-military-encryption-with-quantum-computers/>

Do not get me wrong. Quantum computers are an important thing to keep in mind and follow. This result published by this group is just not very meaningful but it might be a small step in the direction we expect the quantum computing space to go. Not today, not tomorrow, but in a few years. Overall, the progress is slower than I expected it a few years ago, but we are definitely in the direction of quantum computers becoming a problem for encryption in our lifetime.


Source: I think a few years ago the majority of large quantum computing labs ran an qubit stabilization algorithm I helped develop in the company I was working at. Not sure how many actually used it, but most of them bought it. I left the company many years ago now, but still meet former colleagues and we chat about the development in this space.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll starts a discussion about FUD busting Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g71lyc/daily_general_discussion_october_19_2024/lsnwy1c/)

Do you guys think that there would be value in some sort of FUD busting Ethereum platform a bit like what EthHub used to be in 2018 - 2020 which we could use to combat things like the misinformation and link to in response to all of the blatant lies which gets spread on places like r/ethereum and Twitter?

I'm still unemployed after finishing my masters and I love learning more about Ethereum and helping to bust all of the FUD in other subreddits but I don't know anything about making websites and then also finding a way to integrate the easy answers and information into places where it is needed like r/ethereum and Twitter. Maybe this could be a good project to spin out of EVMavericks. Anyway, I'd happily create content for such a place, a bit like more permanent posts like many dooters here make from time to time. A bit of an Ethereum FUD fighting handbook. I actually just did a grant ecosystem outline for EthStaker and I can tell you that there's plenty of grant money up for grabs for legitimate projects.

So what do you guys think? Is such a thing needed? Does it already exist? And if it is needed and doesn't already exist, could we spin something up out of this community?

<summary>u/18boro starts a discussion about blob fees and u/pa7x1 weights in on the issue and its proposed change</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g71lyc/daily_general_discussion_october_19_2024/lsnkso0/)

[u/18boro](https://reddit.com/u/18boro):

I'm sorta following the discussions around the proposal on a minimum cost for blobs. Since this is currently not production ready, this will be implemented in pectra 2 at the earliest right? 

Also, thoughts on this? It makes sense to me, but my technical understanding is very superficial. We really can't afford blobs to enter a potentially high fee market, that will erode their purpose as a low fee environment on ethereum. That means we need to continue increasing blobs capacity, but with no minimum cost the L2s will continue to live free on ethereum.

---

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g71lyc/daily_general_discussion_october_19_2024/lsplj0d/)

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

One way to think about it. The current min blob fee is 1 Wei, this figure is as arbitrary as any other. It just happens to be the minimal denomination of ETH in the protocol. So it was a lazy choice, or maybe better put, a lack of explicit choice that happened to set the minimal blob price there. If the minimal denomination of ETH would have been higher, that same lazy choice would have resulted in a different minimal base fee.

A more sensible choice is to place it somewhere where blobs are still very cheap when used under capacity, so that the network incentivizes adoption. But when the network observes actual demand blob price discovery can happen in a reasonably short time frame. The EIP makes an attempt to do exactly this. And to be honest, the precise figure you set it at does not matter that much up to a few orders of magnitude up or down, because the exponential update of the blob fee can act relatively quickly. 

So I'm in favor of the change. There is perhaps smarter things that can be done with the fee markets of blob and gas. There are some interesting proposals for using AMMs, PIDs, etc... I think those deserve to be explored too, but they are more complex and need to be very well understood economically. This EIP is just a very quick and risk-free fix to an obvious problem with the current blob pricing.

<summary>u/Dreth provides some good perspective on where Ethereum is currently at</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gaux5i/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2024/ltkbx86/)

Believe it or not, the blobs upgrade might be one of the bigger reasons why ETH isn't doing much better price wise. I'm not sure if traders generally consider this a factor, though I would imagine they do given that ETH performed much better relative to BTC (as it had historically) between The Merge and the last upgrade.

Blobs have given the apparent impression that Ethereum is empty and with no activity. The L2 scaling roadmap allows for absolutely *explosive* activity on L2s, but it makes L1 seem deserted when that L2 activity isn't saturating L1. 

Is this bad? No, it's fantastic, it is just a consequence of the upgrade and activity not exploding _just yet_, but this is an illusion. If you take a look at L2Beat in mid 2023 and today, the amount of new L2s is absolutely ridiculous. It seems like there's more new L2s than new apps and it is insanely easy to underestimate the potential effects of this.

While everyone is looking at useless ratios like ETH/BTC or ETH/SOL, plenty of new projects are appearing to develop their own L2s. Ethereum is no longer just an 'app chain' it is a chain of chains. Pretty much what Polkadot or Cosmos set out to be, but in a more 'open' way so to speak. I don't understand in full depth the implementation of app chains in these two other projects, but in Ethereum I know projects can have plenty of different configurations regarding where data is stored, where execution happens, etc etc. The appearance of macro-protocols like Eigenlayer is a clear telling that there's money to be made in scaling Ethereum, and this is where I presume most of the investor liquidity coming to fund projects on Ethereum is going. I'd be worried when this stops, but not right now.

In some way, what has been built on Ethereum is the ability to have external anchored applications, chains or other products of this kind which benefit from inheriting some level of security from the base layer blockchain.

So who's using this? Users I guess? Right now there may not be enough activity to justify the price increasing, as Ethereum being saturated in some way equates to 'cash flows'. Right now, given that the future of Ethereum's L2 and base layer explosive activity is 'on pause' as the upgrade _just kicked in earlier this year_, it is hard for investors estimate the value of those cash flows.

For BTC, the expectation that Bitcoin (the blockchain) will make any changes to itself in order to accomodate new featuresets is pretty much non-existent. On Ethereum, the fact that the base layer can be upgraded and changed allows for new concepts to emerge, for current concepts to be improved, etc. So Ethereum is inherently dependent on the combination of upgrades and activity improving its future cash flows (fees from on-chain activity). Right now, this is lackluster or inconsistent, so once this activity starts kicking in, which might depend or not on price, the consistency of those cash flows will be more visible. 

Basically, It's hard to justify investing large amounts of capital in a peer-to-peer network native currency when there's not enough certainty about its future cash flows. Before the upgrade such a comparatively meaningless amount of activity would saturate the chain that future cash flows were 'easier to expect'.

I think there's several reasons why BTC is outperforming ETH this year:

1. Historically this is the pattern in bullish periods (BTC outperforms, then it doesn't)
2. The BTC ETFs started trading earlier in the year, when the war in the middle east wasn't at its absolute height of explosiveness, when the economy had a better outlook because the high interest rates hadn't affected the US job market, the profitability of the carry trade etc, etc. There's many macroeconomic reasons we can point out, but back in early 2024, things looked WAY better than now even when plenty of banks had collapsed the year prior due to high interest rates. They don't look _that_ bad now, but the outlook was very bleak during the summer.
3. The ETH ETFs were a complete uncertainty, now they're a reality, but they started trading in quite literally the _weakest_ moment in the market of this year.
4. Network activity on Ethereum has apparently subsided significantly (not really, but this is what it would seem like to the untrained eye, this is related to what I explained in the post)
5. BTC is simply more popular not only due to its brand name, that too, but very importantly because it is a very static, unchanging asset with very little medium-term uncertainty, akin to gold. Which is something investors like. ETH is more uncertain.
6. BTC seems to have no competition, ETH seems to have competition, even if it really doesn't.

You'd really have to be really deep into the rabbit hole to understand the value of ETH and the Ethereum blockchain beyond the surface-level perspective an investor trading many many assets in a traditional sense would have. Many traders trade based on cash flows and certainty of cash flows, and Ethereum carries some uncertainty with it and is having a 'weak' year in terms of cash flows.

I won't get into why SOL is outperforming ETH in any meaningful level of detail, but in short, from my perspective:

- the hype around memecoins (expectation of cash flows drives liquidity seeking returns in large numbers)
- the fact that it's a smaller marketcap asset
- the price is lower and you can buy 'a whole unit of it'
- there's apparent activity on it
- it's boosted by entities that want to pump the shit out of it to seek exit liquidity
- it has a lot of marketing due to the previous point
- it has provided extraordinary returns this year, so there's expectation that this will keep on happening
- most of the supply is held by entities that don't sell it (large stakers and node operators which additionally receive most of the inflation)
- etc etc

If anyone reads this wall of text pls correct me if you find any flaws in my reasoning. I hope it helps some have some perspective as to why I believe ETH's performance this year has been lackluster comparatively to other assets.

Edit: small tweaks, typo fixes and corrected some term precision (I try not to use ETH and Ethereum interchangeably, as ETH is the asset and Ethereum is the network)

Layer 2 Update - growthepie

Sorry I haven't been as active lately IRL sometimes gets in the way but I'm back with a longer L2 update to try and cover everything I have missed.  


- Layer 2s are growing so fast they have normalized All Time Highs  
- Layer 2s have more value locked in ETH than Stablecoins  
- Layer 2 Stablecoins have grown the equivalent of a small country's GDP this year:

- Base on track to double the Throughput of the whole layer 2 ecosystem in less than a year   
- We had some great Gitcoin rounds thanks to all that donated - small donations make a big difference  
- growthepie is now active in onchain governance - currently for ZKsync, Arbitrum and Optimisum (more on the way) please consider delegating to us  
- We have improved our zoom feature   
- Layer 2 TVL  measured in ETH is up only  
- Blobs have seen spikes in the past but not so much in the past 90 days with us approaching the target is this going to change?  
- Ethereum doesn't have problems - Ethereum has improvements waiting to be implemented... Layer 2s are part of the solution  
- Reminder to compare Layer 2s use our single chain pages and use the compare feature   
- Over half of the Layer 2s we cover are "General Purpose" and they account for 97.9% of weekly active addresses  
- Vitalik highlights Optimism in working on chain neutral Crosschain interfaces

I think it's been possible to set up a delegate profile since a few days, have you done that alreaady? If so, would you share it here, so we can link it tomorrow?

Also if there is a second delegate that would be beautiful. I think it's always easier and better if there are two people that know each other (at least a little bit) to discuss things in private first, then post either on the governance forum or ask for feedback here. So any second member willing to do this, happy to share your profile tomorrow as well!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g9aee7/daily_general_discussion_october_22_2024/lt7mw0j/)

Depending on how long you've been around, you may or may not know that I got popular in Ethereum by creating early [video guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyd7_Y0BY_c) showing how to spin up validators on testnets.

Well, the [ephemery](https://ephemery.dev) testnet is very exciting to me, and on Thursday, 10/24, I'm planning to release a video guide showing how to create a validator on it.

Ephemery is a re-generating short-lived testnet designed for testing, especially for people who want to stake. The testnet resets every 28 days, and all of the unused Ether is recycled. (My current understanding is that if you're running an active validator you can keep that 32 Ether in the new instance.)

EthStaker recently [hosted a call with Ephemery developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG_b1HkQnno) and now I'm excited about sharing a video guide to help people get a validator running on it. it IS getting polished, but right now there's still a fair barrier of experience to getting on it.

I think the most exciting thing for me is the opportunity to play slashing games without any fear of consequences. I hope you'll join me :)

<summary>u/interweaver discusses the difference between price and value</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ga2kk9/daily_general_discussion_october_23_2024/ltgiqcy/)

It is fascinating to me how many people, here and elsewhere, still haven't realized that **price** and **value** are two separate concepts, only extremely loosely bound by the collective (un)intelligence of the market. 

On the one hand, this means that poor price performance does not, and should not, imply anything about the fundamental value of something. Many r/ethwhinance posters make that mistake: they see Eth the asset performing badly compared to other (cherry-picked) assets on certain (cherry-picked) timelines, and feel the need to build a (counterfactual) narrative about how Ethereum the platform must therefore be falling behind on most fundamental metrics. 

On the other hand, it means that even outstanding fundamental value does not guarantee anything about price performance on any particular timeline. Many bull posters here, myself included, have fallen into this trap: assuming that Ethereum's stellar fundamentals mean we will see good price performance in the near/medium-term future. This is equally a logical misstep; the most innately valuable asset in the world can be sold for precisely $0 if nobody understands why it should be valued.

Arguments will be made about how the "markets are efficient" and that price and value should be tightly coupled, but I will emphatically suggest that at least in the realm of crypto, the markets and their participants have been and remain to this day, in overwhelming majority, catastrophically ignorant. This will change in time, but I'm increasingly realizing that this time will be measured in decades, not in months or years.

If you can avoid the trap of assuming a timely or intelligent linkage between price and value in either direction, you will save yourself needless hand-wringing, avoid getting your hopes up prematurely, and perhaps (if you are still in a position to be patient and stay informed) realize the opportunity this massive informational asymmetry *still* presents, years and years after we first started noticing it. 

Probably the most fundamental assumption of investing (as opposed to gambling) is the proposition that *eventually*, over some arbitrarily long timeframe, markets *do* finally realize what's up, and price *does* synchronize with value. And when that happens, those of us who didn't give up on Ethereum because the ignorant markets were ignoring Ether, and yet who also didn't let all the bull posts convince us to take unwise risks and were therefore able to stay in the game long-term - when that happens, we will be very, *very* happy.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g127sk/comment/lrdnpgo/)

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

Some thoughts about the unichain announcement. Now if that means fees go down, that's obviously good. If that means that more value goes to L2s that probably also good, even if it fragments stuff in the beginning. In the end, that's one more step towards onchain price discovery.

What I think is interesting is what this means for Max Resnicks thesis. Uniswap is like 40% of defi (and the other 40% being AAVE, 20% long tail) and if that moves to an L2, the whole "L1 is for defi" argument is kind of obsolete. I don't think this is just a L1 fee decision, this is more control of the product (e.g. block times) and value capture. "Defi" just moved off L1. If I understand things correctly, AAVE v4 is also building towards that, they are just not building their own chain, but bridges between all L2 markets to create one bug liquidity pool.

There's 2 more things we need, abstracting chains away for the user and fix fragmentation of liquidity. And then this whole discussion is hopefully over.

<summary>u/eth10kIsFUD is doing the math after yesterday's conversation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g127sk/comment/lrf6ons/)

u/cryptOwOcurrency started a great discussion yesterday around Bitcoin security budget with the question: When will it break? Let's try to do some napkin maths:

Bitcoin paid $27m to miners yesterday. 97% of this was issuance. The marketcap secured by this is around $1.2T. On a relative basis that is 27/1.2= $22m of security per day for every Trillion USD Mcap. 

In less than four years that will be $11m of security per day for every Trillion USD Mcap. $6m in 8 years.

At $6m per day that's around $2.2b of economic security per year per Trillion. Industrial miners are generally looking to ROI in less than a year on their hardware investment, so let's assume the cost of the hardware deployed to earn this $2.2b is around $2.2b. This 1 year ROI is also close to what is observed on the network today using the numbers estimated by Justin Drake in this tweet ($17.5 per TH/s): [https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1763632918994260481](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1763632918994260481)

This gives an attacker a price of around $2.2b in hardware spent per Trillion USD in Bitcoin marketcap to achieve 51% of network power in 8 years time. Not taking into consideration the large economies of scale advantage an attacker would get. Coinglass currently shows a 24h BTC Puts options volume of around $1b at a current mcap of $1.2T so getting a short position that could capitalize on the attack seems very doable. 

Even if Bitcoin's price 10x's within the next 8 years ($12T mcap) that would put the total price of attack at $26b. Around 80 individuals on the forbes list currently has this amount on their own. For nation states this is still peanuts. And could most likely be made profitable by any group amassing this amount of capital. At this mcap MicroStrategy's holdings alone would be worth around 6x this amount.

Bitcoin in it's current state will not be secure in 8 years. Markets are forward looking, I believe we'll see serious infighting in 4 years. 

**The iceberg is straight ahead and the captain has left the ship.**

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra Let's assume that ETH continues to crab indefinitely ...</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g2ial1/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2024/lrrgzpq/)

Let's assume that ETH continues to crab indefinitely, while other crypto, bitcoin, stocks, and real estate keep climbing, and inflation means that everything not going up is losing value.

How many months/years/decades would you keep holding? Would you still be holding In December 2026 if the price is $2600? Would you still be holding in May 2029 if the price is $2400? What if it's 2031 and ETH is ranked #4 or #5 on marketcap with Solana or Tron or Sui or Cardano (lol) being higher?

Staking has enough APY to keep me satisfied for now, and I still think there's gonna be a bull eventually, but it's been years since a proper bull run and it's making me sad. Everything else in my (*extremely ETH heavy*) portfolio is outperforming. The price is low enough that I *should* be DCAing, since I've said before that this is what I do sub $2500, but for this month, I'll just consider not selling my monthly staking proceeds as my "DCA".

I do think election week and January are going to be very telling on crypto and Ethereum's medium term price action, and I am going to have to reassess my long term plan after that. But I suspect I'm gonna be doing this holding thing for another couple of years.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g2ial1/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2024/lrrvlqx/)

It would pretty bizarre for ETH to be in this range into 2030. It will either break up or down by then and considering the competition doesn't stack up in a variety of ways I'm still betting on it breaking up. In TA terms we've really only been crabbing since March of this year. I know when we look at last cycles PA it's like, "why haven't we broken our ATH yet..." but it's just ETHs beta being higher relative to BTC. We're catching the downside volatility right now but later in this cycle I suspect it we'll catch that beta with positive price action and vastly outperform by this time next year.

Last cycle ETH put in roughly 6,000% gains from cycle bottom to top. 1/10th of that price performance gets ETH to ~6k, 1/5th gets it to ~12k. I think even with diminishing returns things look bright for us. 1/5th isn't even the limit, 1/3rd is even possible imo which would take ETH to ~20k. 

Expecting 5 figure ETH is realistic this cycle.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g2ial1/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2024/lrovjs7/)

Im so fatigued of crypto stuff, that the last "farming" i did was to diversify my eth into different lrst.   
Now that im only waiting for swell and diva/nectar im feeling glad its over so to speak.  
I missed the OP #5 airdrop and will miss scroll and linea etc, just because i couldnt get myself to keep getting farmed.

After years in crypto and defi, there is currently built 2 things im using often as a  non whale LP¬¥er and ponzi yield farmer.

1.Sportsbetting has become competitive with the best bookies, and betting without middlemen from your wallet is amazing, shoutout to all teams working on this, in my experience SXbet ,Thales/Overtimemarkets.xyz, Azuro/bookmaker.xyz has everything i need as a casual bettor.

2.Gnosispay Visa card is next level awesome imo. Getting 4% cashback on my spending, and be able to just put ‚Ç¨ into my gnosissafe adress and spend is amazing.

(3,4) honorable  \*biased \*mentions should be my heavy bags of SNX and WINR, SNX because they have started a work on renewing to hopefully be relevant in defi again after getting left behind in innovation and token price at all time low.  
WINR because they seemingly try to take gambling completely onchain+ give users option to single side LP in the pools that are +EV for the house

My wife, who is doing an online course on crypto (yes!), just asked my help in understanding the "Value-blindness" part of the following part of her studying material:

*The 2014 Ethereum whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin, the founder, identified key limitations in Bitcoin's scripting capabilities:*  

* *Lack of Turing-completeness: Bitcoin's scripting language is not Turing-complete, it can‚Äôt perform all possible computational operations.*  
* __*Value-blindness: Bitcoin scripts cannot natively assess the value of transactions.*__  
* *Lack of state: Bitcoin lacks a mechanism to track and store the state of complex applications.*  
* *Blockchain-blindness: Bitcoin scripts have limited ability to interact with or understand blockchain data beyond simple transaction details.*  

*Ethereum was designed to overcome these limitations and to address the need for creating new blockchains for different functionalities.*

I told her I know some super-friendly people who'll def help!

You know what the ETH graph reminds me of? Definitely not a crab.

A Crab Market would be a stable unmoving price, progressing the graph in a flat line to the left. Maybe with equal up/down slow waves. But the current action is much more annoying.

Have you noticed snails exploring their surroundings using their eye tentacles? They slowly extend them, touch something, and then rapidly retract them back.

That's what ETH does. Every time it slowly probes a few USD above its price, it rapidly withdraws back in fear. As if hit by electricity. Slow candle up, instant withdrawal back down. Especially funny in the one-minute chart, but it can be seen in all time-frames.

So I officially propose that we are in a Snail Market. üêå

<summary>u/haurog brings Vitaliks talk from Token2049</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fv071m/comment/lq3nd6h/)

For those who missed it or could not understand anything in the shaky videos that were available until just a few days ago, Vitaliks famous talk from Token2049 is now on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpOSqLjYb0o&list=PLvSllGeSAEeeFUUcy7kKk0VIs4YNDhspY

He is asking himself if we are still early and what he is excited about in the next 10 years. He thinks we are not early anymore, but we are still early for crypto being useful. He ties this into his experiences paying with crypto for daily necessities and why it failed originally. Hint, it was the fees and the overall user experience (UX). In the last years to UX improved massively due to EIP1559 and the the switch to POS. The recent dencun upgrade introduced blobs which dropped the fees to close to zero. Before all these improvements, the underlying technology was limiting what could be built on top and how successful it could become. These limitations are not the bottleneck anymore, but we still need a reason to actually use the applications built on crypto. He argues that the resilience and robustness of the underlying blockchain is what matters the most, but the UX on top needs to be good as well. Preserving the underlying advantages of the Ethereum network and being able to improve the UX for mainstream users should be the key goal. He sees a few places where there will be the most improvements in the next years.

- Wallet tradeoffs and how multisigs, guardians and the combination with zkproofs have or will improve that space. This allows web2 UX with web3 robustness. 

- Social media where you actually own the account (warpcast).

- Payment wallets which are getting close to venmo experience.

- Privacy pools were you can proof to not be the bad guy without revealing who you are. This exists in an early version at least. 

- Zk proofs in social media will make it possible to proof that you fullfill certain criterias without revealing who you are.

- L1 improvements: Single slot finality, verkle trees (statelessness), handling MEV on the protocol level, ZK snarkifying the L1 and light clients

These improvements will allow Ethereum to thread the needle and become mainstream user friendly while staying true to the underlying cypherpunk values which built the network.


But enough beating around the bush. The only reason this talk has become famous is Vitaliks singing session in the middle of it. Here they are together with the original songs. Especially the second song took my some time to find a source.

Laputa ending song: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdpEnkcT7Io>

<summary>u/PhiMarHal is humbly begging for scraps of your attention</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fv071m/comment/lq69vwf/)

I'm confident the Scroll airdrop snapshot was already taken.

Why, you ask? Simple: for the past few months, I've been toying with a small dapp idea. A collaborative story where everyone writes together and mints NFTs by writing. I'm enthralled by the concept, and I figure I could lure some of you fine gentlemen into my lair by alluding, not so subtly, that any sort of activity on Scroll could help qualify for a big fat airdrop.

But then, something terrible happened. You see, I started using AI. Claude Sonnet 3.5 specifically. 

As someone who's not a coder, the whole process of building anything with code usually goes like: 

- have a good time writing actual code for a couple hours

- then hit a roadblock on something arcane related to programming

- then be forced into the most tedious websearch adventure for a solution to this problem

And those roadblocks happen dozens of times.

None of that anymore. Claude is always there to give an answer, always available to suggest something. We talk it out and eventually figure out the thing. The good lad never gets tired of my walls of text.

This is the terrible part. I started Having Fun.

And when you enjoy the process, you start spending more time refining everything to your liking.

It went on and on and what do you know, now we're in October. Rumors abound TGE is soon. Scroll 1 year anniversary is coming up in mid October. Hints everywhere the eye can see.

Instead of coming to you all with a cheeky smile and an airdrop nudge nudge wink wink, I am here hat in hand, on my knees, humbly begging for scraps of your attention.

Please, kind sir, may you take a look at my dapp?

It's a good dapp. I promise. Maybe.

I wrote some about what it actually is here: [Blog Link](https://mirror.xyz/loiyaa.eth/SSbs_q0TyPyLLXJszUkIUtgP7OzIYQxKMNL30ak43C8)

[Frontend Link](https://contributors.loiyaa.com/)

In all seriousness, I find it incredible just how far you can get with AI. I didn't write any code here. All it takes is a bit of persistence. We're moving fast into a world where everyone can make their own toys exactly to their liking by chatting up a virtual assistant. If you have ideas you want to see happen and time to spend, there's very little to stop you.

<summary>u/haurog shares his take on Lido's Community Staking Module</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fvrhxr/daily_general_discussion_october_4_2024/lq9wpa6/)

Financially for node operators it is a great product. Lido tries everything to get people on board. If you are on their early adoption whitelist they even allow for a lower bond for the first share, increasing the rewards even further. As far as I see pretty much anyone running a node anywhere is on the list (20k-30k) addresses. They also are present pretty much everywhere to advertise the start of the CSM. As far as I see they limit the shares to 12 for each node operator, which means even under the most optimistic assumptions the amount of ETH the solo node operators will handle will be at most be in the single digit percentage of the whole validators Lido has. It is a good development, but will not change the validator distribution setup within Lido to any meaningful degree.

On a more personal opinion I try to stay as far away as possible from Lido as they have a massive war chest and a lot of influential people on their pay roll. They can undercut the competition for very long to make sure none other staking solution survives. Their initial plan of cross-subsidicing the CSM with revenue from their more centralized staking business was a pretty direct attack on the current solo staker landscape. Not sure of they changed this though. Their history of gaslighting the solo staker community and claiming them to be 'irrational actors' massively soured my opinion. They way they plan to centralize the Ethereum staking under their umbrella and even calling it decentralized, does not help in making me more sympathetic towards them. In the long run I think they are a massive problem for the Ethereum network and I really hope we can keep them from taking over the staking layer.

The sad reality is that there is very little decentralized competition. Rocketpool still is the only properly decentralized solution. They are much smaller, they are in the middle of a year long change in how much bond their stakers need. In a few weeks we might see the first rocketpool minipool without the need to stake RPL. They just have the first one running on testnet (as of 3 hours ago). I have great hopes that this will be competitive in the long run, but as always with rocketpool it will take some time. An interesting project is Nodeset which is planned to launch soon will be interesting to watch, it is built atop of rocketpool and adds a very soft kyc layer for node operators. Bonds are lower than with rocketpool and no RPL is needed. Another project called Diva which was all the rage last summer (2023) still does not have a fully functioning prototype. Their testnet stopped accepting new node operators after they found some bugs. We will see what will come out of it in months to come. Puffer might be interesting as well, but to be honest I have no idea about the details.

<summary>u/Gumpa-Bucky reflects in light of their crypto anniversary month</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fwivoc/daily_general_discussion_october_5_2024/lqh06d2/)

October is my crypto anniversary month, I thought I would mark it by sharing my ETH journey story with fellow ethfinanciers. At least it is something to read in the low comment weekend.

In October 2013, I bought my first Bitcoin, on the advice of my millennial son, who explained blockchain basics and suggested that BTC's value--about $170 at the time--could go up. After a mini- DCA spree for a year, I got busy with work and stopped paying attention until October 2016 when I read somewhere about ethereum and smart contracts. I thought that was pretty cool. I went on to get my first ETH in 2016, first ledger in 2017, and as prices rose, I cashed out my original fiat investment.

Unfortunately in 2017-2018 a slower work period gave me too much free time so I started trading a bunch with the remaining house money. For a while I got into Vechain and LINK, though fortunately I kept a majority of my portfolio in ETH and BTC. After painful IRS interactions and a desire for simplicity, I decided to abandon all frills and reduced down to just BTC and ETH by 2021.

I went on to launch my first RP minipool (through Allnodes) in late 2021 but sold my RPL and further simplified to vanilla staking last year. I periodically toy with the idea of home staking (and even got an early Proteus to do so), but my frequent travels and lack of confidence have kept me from it so far.

I am in the minority of ethfinanciers who have already achieved retirement the old-fashioned way. My stage in life gives me a different perspective on holding and exiting, and my ETH goal is not to get life-changing money, but rather to be a supporter of this important new technology, to keep my brain active by following its evolution, to use staking income to upgrade my retirement life, and to safely pass a valuable asset on to my grandkids as a hedge against the uncertain world they are growing into.

I discovered r/ethfinance in late 2021 and have truly enjoyed learning from all of you. I am pretty sure I have read and upvoted >95% of the dailies. I mostly lurk but I am proud of my EVM lion and few doots (though no one IRL knows about any of that!). I greatly appreciate the effective moderation and community spirit of volunteerism. For me, this sub also is where I got introduced to the linguistics of social media. So I thank all of you for what you have contributed to my education! I was really hoping to go to Hodlercon this year but I have a hard schedule conflict, so maybe 2026...

<summary>u/EggIll7227 discusses Ethereum's normie narratives</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fx9170/daily_general_discussion_october_6_2024/lqn4a7r/)

My normie-friendly TikTok influencer account is getting lots of traction recently, as my subscribers count breached 2200 (I am catering to 8 millions French Canadians, so it's a decent following in my niche market). It's an education, not monetized, no-shilling-allowed account.

I have learned a few lessons since January, when I launched it.

First : simplicity is king. If your narrative can't be explained in a single, easy to understand sentence, it won't catch up. This is why I am skeptical of things like "triple points asset", "programmable money" and "digital bond". 

What is sticking is : "Ethereum is a decentralized AppStore that anybody can use or deploy on, and you need to pay in ether to use it."

Maybe it's not technicaly accurate, but this is what people understand. 

Second : most people see crypto as a way to get rich, not as a technology. This explains the bottoming ratio : in their eyes, Ethereum is the second cryptocurrency. People like to bet on champions, not on runner-ups. The Flippening is a nice meme, and I would love to see it happen, but realisticaly, it won't ever happen.

Third : a lot of people are still interested in this space. It will take time, probably a few years, but we will have another mania phase.

That being said, I am trying very hard to teach people about the non-speculative parts of crypto, namely decentralized social media and digital artworks. They don't care, but I am still trying.

<summary>u/eth2353 summarises the current homestaker debate and u/supephiz weighs in on the situation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fxzz7t/daily_general_discussion_october_7_2024/lqqwrja/)

[u/eth2353](https://reddit.com/u/eth2353):

There's been some discussion about the hardware and network requirements for Ethereum validators. Obviously maximum decentralization is the goal, but at the same time Ethereum can't scale if we want to let everyone with a Raspberry Pi and a 1Mbps internet connection (*exaggerating here*) participate. I believe the discussion was initially triggered by someone who missed their block proposal, [likely due to not having enough upload bandwidth](https://hackmd.io/@dsjdqQDBRp66btjRzfxjbw/r1OuFG7AA).

The issue is, noone has defined where *the line* is - what are the minimum requirements that still allow you to fully participate in validation of the chain as well as proposing blocks, and what should they be into the future.

The current outcomes of this discussion:

- [a survey in r/ethstaker](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1fqxjdv/important_home_staker_bandwidth_survey/) among home stakers to get a better picture of what hardware and network current stakers have available to them.

- Toni from the EF [put together some numbers on local block building and the effects that blobs have had on it](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-solo-staking-local-block-building-and-blobs/20540).

- https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/559 - a new API endpoint `engine_getBlobsV1` that will help local block building since the proposer won't necessarily have to publish the blobs too. Attesters to the block can simply get the blobs from their own EL client's blob pool if the proposer doesn't manage to publish them quickly enough.

All of this discussion is pretty relevant right now since there's been talks of [increasing the blob count in the upcoming Pectra fork(s)](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1153#issuecomment-2377002932). It's important to note this would be in combination with EIP-7623 which greatly decreases the worst-case size of a block.

I personally feel that a slight increase (as suggested in the linked comment) would be okay provided the teams also manage to ship the new `engine_getBlobsV1` API endpoint. Good news is, [Reth and Besu already support it](https://x.com/gakonst/status/1842316452696859073), [Geth has a PR open](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30537) and [Nethermind has a PR merged](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/7322) ~~and I believe it should not be hard for other EL clients to add~~.

[u/supephiz](https://reddit.com/u/supephiz):

If this were just about building the robust and decentralized smart contract platform we'd be sailing, but the inclusion of a financial reward means that other projects want a piece of the pie. Other projects aren't able to match Ethereum on technical grounds, so they chip away at our social infrastructure, planting seeds of doubt and conflict with the knowledge that a small percent of Ethereum participants will shed away looking for other projects that might be a "more lucrative investment". 

I think the best route here is for us to continue decentralizing by onboarding people who are looking for investments in smart contract platforms, I imagine that over time it'll continue to look like "if you can't beat them, join them" with Ethereum being the victor. 

People who have been around a long time might realize that, while the attacks are changing in nature, they seem to be less of an existential threat and more of an annoyance every day.

If I were to characterize these threats, I'd say that threat actors used to attack head on, but now they feel like they're working for clout inside the ecosystem and likely even working within Ethereum while getting funded by adversarial enterprise.

**Looking for feedback**

Since my app [Boasty](https://boasty.app) didn't see any usage or traction, I decided to stop building features and leave it as is. It remains fully functional and you can still schedule posts on Ethereum. It was a great learning experience.

I thought about the "Pay 1 USDC to do X" hook and came up with a game concept: A prize pool (smart contract) is seeded every day with say 10 or 100 USDC, you play a browser 2D shooter game, and you can submit your high score for a chance to win the whole thing. High scores would be hidden until reveal, then whoever has the highest score gets the payout automatically via smart contract.

So i built [etherglide.net](https://etherglide.net), a PoC of a futuristic 2D space shooter with cyberpunk styling and lore. Game features:

* Use WASD to move Zephyr to avoid obstacles and collect powerups
* Left mouse click to shoot projectiles and destroy enemy crafts for extra points
* Collect ETH to recharge your ammo 
* Collect a speed powerup for a 10 second speed boost 
* The game increases difficulty by increasing the maximum speed and number of obstacles
* Connect your wallet and sign a message to submit a high score to the leaderboard
* Game music and cool pew pew pew sounds!

I am looking for feedback for the concept and game itself. Currently working on the smart contract and more game features (boss fights and gravity mechanics), but wanted to test the waters before sinking too much time into it. Please try it and let me know what you think!

<summary>u/HSuke educates us on full-reserve banking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fys4ny/daily_general_discussion_october_8_2024/lqydx7x/)

####**Why not Full Reserve Banking?**

I was thinking about what would happen if countries switched over to full reserve banking. What would the effects be?

Currently, there isn't a single country that does full-reserve banking. It would greatly contract the economy, and most global companies, VC funding, and innovation would move elsewhere where they can get cheaper loans. It's self-sacrificing idea.

Historically, every country has been on a fractional reserve system since banks and loans existed. Banks can lend out a portion of their customer's deposits to use towards other people's loans. If too many loans defaulted or there were a bank run, the bank would close. Centralized reserves were then invented to handle mass bank runs during times of panic. And overall, strong central banks, when combined with the power to expand money supply, have been extremely successful in preventing mass bank runs. Keep in mind that strong central banks did not exist in the US before the 1940s.

While depressions were extremely common and occurred about every 30 years post-feudalism and before central banks could expand money supply, there hasn't been one since central banks gained that power after the 1930s.

The Silver Standard, Gold Standard, Brent-Wood system, and Fiat systems all used fractional reserve banking. Of those systems, only fiat system could handle nation-wide full reserve banking. The other systems would all fail if the economy grew or contracted because it would not be possible to expand and contract money supply under both a full reserve system and a commodity standard.

**What would happen to banks under full reserve?**

* Banks would stop loaning because they can no longer use customer deposits like checkings/savings/CDs for loans
* Banks would would charge small fees for checkings/savings accounts.
* Many bank locations would close down, and banks would go online
* The central bank reserve would no longer be needed and can safely close. Or maybe it's still needed to bail out the separate loan industry ...

**Where would loans go?**

* Loans would simply move from banks to peer-to-peer lending industries like Prosper and Funding Circle
* Loan intererest rates would shoot up another 5-10%, and mortgages would become even less affordable
* Homes would be less of an investment and more of an ongoing cost (like they are in Japan)
* There would be a lot more buying expensive things without loans
* Overall, the economy would shrink maybe 50-90%, and domestic investments in general would plummet
* Many companies would move abroad to other countries where they can get cheap loans
* VC and innovation would move abroad to other countries.
* Many loans would move abroad to other countries that are still under partial-reserve systems
* Any country that goes full reserve would fall behind other countries.

**What happens during a financial crisis when people aren't able to pay back loans?**

* Banks would be perfectly fine since they're no longer involved
* The loan industry would collapse or fall back to their insurers. Many lenders would default.
* The government may decide to create a central reserve to insure loan agencies
* The government may bail out loan agencies and insurers that are too big to fail. Or maybe they won't and just be ok with letting a section of the economy collapse.
* Anyone who doesn't lend or get loans would be mostly fine and unaffected.
* The financial crisis would be smaller than under partial-reserve

Overall, switching from partial-reserve to full-reserve just migrates failures from banks to the loan industry and causes interest rates to shoot up because customer deposits can't be used. It doesn't prevent systemic failures, but it does make them much smaller. The overall economy will also be much smaller.

Consider China's Evergrande and housing collapse, which is a lot closer to a full-reserve collapse since many Chinese homeowners buy houses in cash. China just let those companies fail and those homeowners lose their deposits. The economy contracted greatly. Some municipals were to close to unrest and insurrection, but because China has a strong government, local governments were able to suppress protests. Overall, the damage was limited.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard is following the white rabbit and you can too</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fzjust/comment/lr60i0j/)

The next section of my [Rabbit Hole Explorer's Guide](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fjkzpm/daily_general_discussion_september_18_2024/lnt7p9q/) is all about crypto etiquette.

**Your Crypto is Private**

If you go to stock trading forums you'll frequently find people posting pictures of their brokerage account positions showing they either made or lost incredible amounts of money. Reputable crypto forums prohibit that for your safety. The blockchain is public unencrypted information. When you post precise positions and trade times you reveal your address to anyone looking. If I know your address I know not only your current net worth but everything you do in the future. You probably aren't intending to forfeit your financial privacy forever; it makes you a target. It enables more credible spear-phishing and tells the attacker whether you have enough funds to be worth their time. Generally speaking, just keep your crypto dealings private or at least relatively anonymous, especially online.

This is true among friends and family for different reasons. There will come a point in your learning where you discover something exciting in this rabbit hole, the whole thing clicks for you, and you become enthusiastic and want to share this with everyone around you. People around you then think you've joined a cult. It's more than a stereotype; I've seen it many times. Even outside of crypto it's usually recommended to avoid mixing business and pleasure. If someone listens to you and makes money they are rarely going to be grateful to you personally. If they listen and lose money you can easily damage relationships. So don't go shilling your favorite memecoin at your next holiday party with friends and family. As an investment of your energy it just doesn't provide a very good risk adjusted return.

In general, while I encourage everyone to talk about what blockchains can do and the benefits they bring, don't talk your bags.  It's one thing to have an conversation about money being a social construct or the outrageous quicks of the banking system. It's quite another to go around making grandiose claims you don't have the means to back up in the moment while telling everyone to buy whatever coin/token you're currently obsessed with. Don't be that annoying guy. If you absolutely can't resist or are obligated to answer because someone directly asks you I recommend you approach the topic like [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oz-XUF1EM&ab_channel=Bankless). Your first objective is to dispel misconceptions and ask confounding questions that lead to thought experiments that the person might actually benefit from. [Be Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). In my experience, the moment a listener perceives even an inkling of self-interest in the topic you will just be another scammer to them. Don't talk your bags, your *crypto is private*.

**Real Help Will Be Public**

Given how overwhelmed you might feel at times when exploring something new it's natural that you want to reach out and ask for help. If you do this in web3 on Discord, Twitter, or Reddit in most places the people who will respond to you, especially in DMs, are scammers. Your transaction failed trying to claim funds on whatever.finance? The scammers just see [this guy](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Russell?file=Russell1.png). They can just *smell* the fresh blood. It's literally their job hunt people like you. *Legit people never DM you first*. They'd rather answer your question in public so the response is indexed for the next people who search.

If a DM is necessary they will tell you to DM them. Scammers can easily impersonate legit people on social media. If you're on Discord, they can DM you despite not even being on the server you're asking for help from and therefore they are out of reach of the moderators of that protocol. They can use the same image and public alias as the legit person you are talking to. If you're on Twitter they can use a subtly different name but have the same profile picture and pay $10 to have a blue checkmark next to their name. You'll sometimes get two or three different accounts messaging you telling you similar things to make the answer look more credible. The differences are easy to miss, you are frustrated even before they reach you and are willing to try something new to fix the problem, and they'll be readily available and eager to "help" you.

Nothing good will come from their help. They'll try to send you to their help server to file a ticket. They'll try to get you to install some custom wallet into your browser. They'll send you to a website that asks for your private key. They'll tell you there's some manual workaround they will do for you if you just send your ERC-20 to their treasury address. These are all obvious red flags but before you even get there the first red flag is you are using DMs at all. Whenever someone reaches out to you first with any type of directions, it's a red flag. *Real help will be public*.

**Be Careful Who You Trust**

Learning in this ecosystem can be frustrating at times. Everywhere you go everyone seems to know more than you about everything from macro economics, to how to read a chart and tell the future, an entire sailors dictionary of jargon from tradfi, to technical specifications of networks that you need a computer science degree to understand. It can all feel frustratingly out of reach but I'll let you in on a secret: most people worth listening to *are capable* of explaining things in simple enough terms that you can understand it. If you are on their platform and they have all the space and time they need to explain something well yet they aren't making the effort to explain it so you can understand it it could be their goal isn't to be understood by you but rather to sound credible and confident so that you buy whatever they are selling. If you stumble into a conversation between two names that have a lot of followers and they are talking way above your head, you are not yet at a place where it's worth reading whatever that is. If you're outmatched to the degree that you aren't prepared to sus out bullshit you shouldn't be considering buying whatever anyone there is selling.

Generally speaking, your favorite crypto influencer is using you as exit liquidity. If you aren't paying for a product, *you are the product*. If you can't figure out how they are monetizing your attention, you can still be certain they are. They are monetizing your attention in every way they can. They are getting paid for ad space. They are executing trades before you can so you're always buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than them if you follow their moves. They need engagement numbers to raise more money from VCs and they need to sustain their token price to keep attention on their project. For all of the above, they need to retain your attention and they will use every cognitive bias at their disposal to do so. People often mistake confidence for aptitude. The loudest voices are those with the strongest incentives not those with the truth. But I will tell you this lesson from cycles past: the most boisterous sounding voices in the crowd have a storied history of imploding a year after you'll first discover them. *Be careful who you trust*.

A common framework I like to use to think about my investments \[rightly, or wrongly, please feel free to critque\].

**Cash:** cash is cash. The dollar is continuously being weakened, but it's important to have cash as a buffer/layer of safety or to buy large dips. \[3-5% Yield\]

**Stocks**: The stock market has been absolutely ripping over the last decade. Important to DCA into stocks on a regular basis, but it's never going to give you insane upside unless you pick a winner like Nvidia or Tesla and average in over a long period. \[8-12% Yield\]

**Real Estate:** Very manual, illiquid, challenging, costly, & time consuming investment \[I have 9 rental properties\]. Very difficult to scale and each house project takes at least 3 months min. \[5-10% Yield annually\]

ETH: Extremely volatile, nascent technology that has the potential to be the internet of value. Has loads of headwinds \[regulatory, challengers, technological, financial\] against it. Also has some of the smartest developers in the world working on it,  and is at the bleeding edge of software. 

  
Asking this to you all seriously, but if you have your bases covered with Cash, Retirement or Stocks-401K/Roth/IRA, Brokerage etc.., Real Estate, **where else do you have the same amount of upside potential as ETH beyond an individual Tech stock like whatever the next Nvidia will be?**

I don't see anywhere else I can allocate my dollars that has the upside potential of ETH? Am I missing something?

<summary>u/Dreth sounds the alarm to a big change in domain names</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1g0bcb1/comment/lrbt9qz/)

Relevant to lots of crypto (and tech) websites and generally for safety around them, given that this political event will probably force a change on a lot of domain names. In short, the `.io` TLD will disappear.

Relevant excerpt from [this article](https://every.to/p/the-disappearance-of-an-internet-domain) explaining it:

> Since 1968, the UK and U.S have operated a major military base on the Chagos Islands (officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory) , but the neighboring nation of Mauritius has always disputed British sovereignty over them. The Mauritian government has long argued that the British illegally retained control when Mauritius gained independence. It has taken over 50 years, but that dispute has finally been resolved. In return for a 99-year lease for the military base, the islands will become part of Mauritius. 

> Once this treaty is signed, the British Indian Ocean Territory will cease to exist. Various international bodies will update their records. In particular, the International Standard for Organization (ISO) will remove country code ‚ÄúIO‚Äù from its specification. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which creates and delegates top-level domains, uses this specification to determine which top-level country domains should exist. Once IO is removed, the IANA will refuse to allow any new registrations with a .io domain. It will also automatically begin the process of retiring existing ones. (There is no official count of the number of extant .io domains.)

> Officially, .io‚Äîand countless websites‚Äîwill disappear. At a time when domains can go for millions of dollars, it‚Äôs a shocking reminder that there are forces outside of the internet that still affect our digital lives.

However, note that some exceptions to the rules have been made for other commercially successful TLDs ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io)):

> With the United Kingdom giving up sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius[17] (but maintaining the military base on Diego Garcia via an initial 99 year lease), it is possible under IANA rules, the .io domain will eventually have to be phased out within the following several years,[18][19] although historically, some exceptions been granted, as was the case for .su.

Just wanted to share this cool dashboard showing the onchain activities of Optimism citizens/badge holders (of which there are quite a few in here):

<https://dune.com/lamora/optimism-citizens>

It shows a comparison with a control group of normal Optimism users, with metrics such as participation in other DAOs, usage of OP stack chains and web3 social media.

The biggest difference seems to be in adoption of Farcaster, with 59% of badgeholders using it compared to about 12% of regular users. It also really shows how much more popular Farcaster is than Lens, which is only used by about 11.4% of badgeholders (and less than 8% of regular users).

I'd be interested to see crossover metrics with those used for the EVMaverick Resume (https://dune.com/mtitus6/EVMavericks-Resume) such as the number of stakers, wallet age etc, and vis versa, showing EVM participation in other DAOs etc.

In fact, I wonder how many OP Citizens also hold an EVMav? It feels pretty stupid that I've been in crypto so long and never bothered to learn to use Dune, maybe that will be my project for the weekend...

Ethereum mainnet gas at 23 Gwei right now.

Not in a bullrun, not in a mania phase. During a truly boring period.

While L2s scale us 23x. While active addresses are at an ATH of 10 million a week.

The market clearly doesn't see it yet but here's what will happen within a few months:

After years of underperformance, ether sees a sudden correction. Narratives immediately follow price action. Enthusiasm returns. Euphoria follows. Influencers on all sides start to pretend they all saw it coming. It was obvious. Activity skyrockets. L1 burn brings deflation back. L2 activity keeps growing, faster and faster. Millions of new users join the L2s. Blob usage reach max value. More users. Price discovery begins. Blobs start contributing to the burn. New L2s appear faster than you can follow. More institutional L2s. Blackrock L2. Stock market on L2. More users. Soon, L2 activity is higher than we can accommodate.  

Ether price explodes.

Getting into eth action is 100x easier than last bullrun. People buy using paypal. People buy using debit card on Metamask. Coinbase sends their flux of new users to Base. More users. Ethereum starts to become a staple of reliability brands use in commercials. Institutions start to notice Ethereum. Mentioning Ethereum in business plans becomes as popular as AI currently is. Institutions want exposure, this time they can. More users. The ETF gains crazy popularity. Money inflows look like they'll keep coming forever. Negative regulatory efforts don't matter anymore, you can't stop the infinity machine.

Ethereum made it. We made it.

Max Resnick is back with some more bad takes.

For those that missed it, in yesterday's [Execution Layer meeting (discussion goes for about 30min)](https://www.youtube.com/live/PWhn8KdgCl8?si=nCINzxlcgUlY9imD&t=2338) there was a discussion on whether to increase blobs from 4 to 5 and increase the blob target from 3 to 4 in Pectra A. The reason for this is to maintain adoption of blobs by L2s to help tide us over until we have PeerDAS.

*Before continuing it's important to note that the blobs we have now were always meant to be a stopgap until PeerDAS and network upgrades, which makes it more efficient to scale. We were never meant to scale blobs under current conditions.*

There were mentions that some are already struggling with bandwidth, but was brushed off as anecdotal. Thankfully Potuz spoke up for home stakers and said we should treat data from both sides the same since those that are having no issues is anecdotal too. So there was agreement to get more data on this first before deciding whether to include these changes or not. Ryan Berckmans also made [a post on the research forum](https://ethresear.ch/t/wheres-the-home-staking-bandwidth-research/20507/2) for this data.

Today Ben Edgington, who is a major contributor to getting Ethereum to where it is today, wrote in a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1839585322683822318) that he was seeing he was having signs of issues too.

In comes Max Resnick [quote tweeting Ben's post](https://twitter.com/MaxResnick1/status/1839596419608424837) and the following conversation insued:

Max: Bandwidth capacity grows at 50% a year. Asking the entire global network to slow down while we are actively battling for market share with an extremely competent opponent because you live in a swamp with 12mb/s bandwidth is extremely selfish.

Ben: Where did I ask for the entire global network to slow down?

Max: You are literally saying your node can not keep up, so you want to propose fewer blobs in your blocks. Why don't you shut your node down and unstake? You are slowing down the network by doing this.

Ben: I dislike your dystopian future.

Max: We can no longer afford to eat the cost of these luxury beliefs. Solo staking in a place where you do not have appropriate bandwidth imposes an externality on the network. If Ethereum doesn't win, the world looks much more dystopian than a world where Ethereum sacrifices a few rural solo stakers in exchange for vastly increased performance.

*end*

[Nixo put it perfectly](https://twitter.com/nixorokish/status/1839707152430301514) with how it feels reading that:

>That feeling when arrogant young blood opining on the future of Ethereum comes in hot and tells the one of the most OG cypherpunks I know, who literally wrote the book on Ethereum, to shut down his node and unstake \[image of sad pepe looking out a rainy window\]

And Max replies to nixo's tweet with a gif saying to shut it down. What a disgrace.

<summary>u/HSuke shares their story of falling for a scam</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fr6w8s/daily_general_discussion_september_28_2024/lpchlgo/)

After a decade in the crypto space, I finally became a victim of a scam. Fortunately, it was only for about $20 worth of useless Hamster Kombat tokens, and I was already fullly prepared for it to be a scam.

This was entirely expected. At least I got front-row tickets to see this shitshow, and it's been the most fun I've had from the utterly-boring Hamster Kombat game.

Around this August, the HamsterKomat team promoted a non-KYC, no-gas method for the token airdrop that used the Ebi.xyz DEX. All the other airdrop methods uses CEXs that weren't available in the US, so that was my only choice. I figured the airdrop would be tiny, and I couldn't care less about it, so I picked it because it the easiest method.

I already knew Ebi.xyz was an unknown DEX that was created around the time that Hamster Kombat launched, possibly by the same Hamster Kombat team. Pretty much nothing is known about the real members of either team.

* 3 days before the airdrop, Ebi team said they had airdropped tokens to their users. We told them they were wrong.
* Around this time, the HamsterKombat sub shut down and disabled all new posts. The mods left and the remaining mod has since disappeared.
* On the day of the airdrop (Sept 26), Ebi congratulated everyone for receiving their airdrop
* Not a single person who used Ebi actually received their airdrop
* After a few hours, they said they were encountering technical difficulties, and their website became unavailable
* A few hours later, the website came back up, and Ebi said they were working through technical difficulties due to high volume
* By now, their Twitter account and Discord channel was full of thousands of people calling them scammers
* On Sept 27, they made an announcement that the Airdrop claims were live. We immediately checked, saw nothing, and told them they were full of shit.
* On Sept 28, the Ebi.xyz website went down for maintenance again and came back up 2 hours later. And none of us have received our tokens.
* The token price has been dropping about 15-30% every day, and we have no idea what they're doing with our tokens.

And that wraps up what I know so far.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard shares some thoughts on investing trends, the cost of living and AI</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fsnv17/daily_general_discussion_september_30_2024/lppkngp/)

Some pontification... I feel like I've been able to predict all the major tech trends from the last 25 years, whether it was operating systems, search engines, cloud computing, weed stocks, EVs, crypto, or AI. Right now, for the first time in a long time, I just don't know.

AI, at least at the startup stage, is clearly in a bubble. I strongly believe in the transformative power of AI but it's already had its 10x recently and random VC investments I'm reviewing are raising $100M just for mentioning AI. Do you honestly expect NVDA to do *another* 10x from here? You can buy MSFT and just sit on it or something broad spectrum like VTI and probably make your 8% a year but that's not a play for risk-seeking capital like all these other bets have been. Gold's been having a great run with nation states trying to de-dollarize and basically rotating US bond reserves into precious metal reserves but even if I'm up like 40% there it's just *boring* and I don't see a future in it outside of the current run. Maybe I need to look into emerging markets? Maybe there just is no 1000% tech investment to be found right now and I just need to stay informed, preserve capital, and wait? In the meantime I'm just parked barbell style in liquidity farming and working the fiat mines but it increasingly feels like if I'm not making 10% a year on my whole portfolio I'll be falling behind to inflation let alone able to live off my assets.

I feel like I have enough most people would consider me wealthy but increasingly capital is the only thing that will make money in the world while the supply and demand of human labor will be increasingly out of balance as AI accelerates. Child care costs over $2k a month while the employees watch 8 kids each and make like $10-15/hr. Universities put students hundreds of thousands into student debt yet lecturers are working multiple jobs to get by. The medical industry and end of life care is going to systemically drain all the boomers wealth before it passes down but the caretakers of those facilities are overworked and couldn't afford a room at the facilities they work at. All of our services seem to cost astronomical amounts compared to pre-covid but the people doing the work aren't making that. So who is? Capital.

You can see what's happening to the 98% of people already left behind. Now add in AI displacing tens of millions of jobs over the next decade. As is the nature of automation, it will replace labor with profits to AI companies but a 10/1 ratio. I once led a team of AI engineers that was automating the jobs of 200 workers at $15 an hour per engineer per year. The software was considered a depreciating asset with a three year shelf life so we were considered to be making $18M in savings per engineer per year. That was 6 years ago; the technology is much more powerful now.

I feel like there's this metaphorical wave I need to catch and I'm just behind the crest of it working hard to get on top of it so I can let the water do the work instead of me padding the whole way. The fear of being left behind keeps me motivated but it's not a happy mindset. The way out of it is to combine let the fiat mines pay the bills while I find the next 5x tech innovation to ride up but again I feel stumped there for the first time in a long time.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fsnv17/daily_general_discussion_september_30_2024/lpqzn5d/)

Regarding `eth-usd` Google data: You may have noticed Google removed the nice chart in search results. This data _used_ to be powered by CoinMarketCap.

Earlier in the month, the data just stopped and was stuck.

Myself and other members of this community called attention to Google (and I tried getting in touch with CoinMarketCap, but, no surprise, no one responded). Last week, a Google search for "eth-usd" started working again, but without a chart. It's actually returning data from Yahoo! Finance.

I also noticed that my Google Sheets function (`=GOOGLEFINANCE("ETHUSD")`) was _still_ stuck on the wrong price, so I clicked the "Disclaimer" in the footer of Google Sheets around stock/currency prices, which led me to this familiar page: https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/

HOWEVER, the provider of cryptocurrency data has changed from CoinMarketCap to Morningstar (I assume [this](https://www.morningstar.com/) Morningstar).

I can't find the price of regular old ETH (or BTC or anything else crypto-related that's not a fund) on their public site, but maybe it's behind a login/paywall.

Anyway, the point is, Google must be aware shit's not working, but they didn't really fix anything yet. I encourage you to click those little "Help" buttons/links in Sheets or in Search or in your Admin Console and complain! Squeaky wheel and all that!

<summary>u/Dreth fills us in on the happenings in Chinese financial markets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ftg8jb/daily_general_discussion_october_1_2024/lpuikxy/)

Something's brewing in Chinese markets. I'm sure you guys remember the Chinese housing market was going through a bubble pop and property prices had come down significantly from their peak over there. With lots of property in horrendous conditions, lots of property being liquidated at low prices but nobody purchasing them, etc.

Recently the People's Bank of China announced several measures that in isolation might seem appropriate to stimulate the economy, but when combined all together generate a crazy amount of stimulus. This is with the intend of pushing economic growth up, increasing stock market prices and increasing property prices.

The measures are:

- Interest rates paid to savings in banks were pushed down from 1.7% to 1.5% - The lowest interest rate in its history. This is intended to push banks to seek to lend more and the movement of savings into the market for investment.

- The % of deposits that must be covered by liquid reserves in banks (only for the largest banks). It used to be 10% but it's been reduced to 9.5%. Its lowest level since 2007. This is expected to come down even more in the future. This allows them to use this additional liquidity to provide more credit. Approximately an additional injection of about 140 billion USD equivalent of liquidity.

- Cut of interest rates for business debt and mortgages, reduced from 3.35% to 3.15%. Incentivising more lending for families and businesses.

Additionally, they want to create [a new monetary policy tool to refloat the stock market, a swap program for securities, insurance companies and funds to obtain liquidity through asset collateralization](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202409/24/content_WS66f22d00c6d0868f4e8eb322.html), essentially collateralized lending.

This essentially opens up 500 billion yan (~70 billion USD) of liquidity with possible expansions in the future.

They're also intending to create a fund to 'stabilize the stock market'. Essentially a centrally planned monetary policy plan to artificially push the stock market up and property.

Lastly, for property purchases, they want to reduce the barrier of entry for 2nd home purchases, which used to be limited for banks to lend about 75% of the value of the property, but now banks can lend about 85% of the value of the property. For smaller local government entities, banks will be allowed to lend 100% of the value of properties if those local government entities want to buy those 'unpurchaseable' properties. Up until now banks were allowed to lend 60% of the value of those properties to those local government entities.

The People's Bank of China also said that this 'won't be enough' and that they will have to resort to fiscal stimulus as well.

Since September 13th, the CSI 300 (capitalization-weighted stock market index designed to replicate the performance of the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange) has since risen in price about 27%.

Generally if you're invested in this market, congratulations. For everyone else, this is generally very risky. Every time megastimulus plans like these are launched, enormous amounts of liquidity flow into perhaps not the most productive places in the economy, but instead often times those targeted sectors affected by the stimulus, regardless of the productivity of these markets or if they can even recover.

The fear and greed index of the CSI 300 and the ETF call volume have both risen to their highest level since 2015.

TL;DR: The People's Bank of China is applying a megastimulus to the economy to refloat the stock and property markets to a concerning extent.

<summary>u/benido2030 explains the utility of the EIGEN token</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ftg8jb/daily_general_discussion_october_1_2024/lpthpzq/)

Eigenlayer is a restaking protocol, which means it provides security/ trust for new protocols/ products that don't have the time/ money/ community to build it from scratch. People stake ETH to secure Ethereum and the same collateral can be reused ("restaked") to secure new L1s, L2s, oracles etc. 

Usually when you stake, you can be slashed when you misbehave. When you try to misbehave (e.g. double spend) on ETH mainnet this can (and will) be slashed and you will lose ETH as a consequence because this happens onchain and is easy to judge. 

But there are things that the blockchain/ nodes can't detect or that aren't easy to judge. These decisions are "intersubjective". Slashing isn't possible. One famous example is a data availability layer where a node withholds information. This doesn't happen onchain, because the submission of the data happens offchain. 

For these "intersubjective" cases $EIGEN comes into play. If people believe that nodes misbehaved they challenge the nodes, fork $EIGEN and hope that others follow their arguments and make their $EIGEN fork the new central token within Eigenlayer. Eigenlayer obviously can't and shouldn't even try to fork ETH, so they created their own token to take this task. 

tl;dr
  
ETH is used for objective misbehaviour

EIGEN is used of intersubjective misbehaviour

<summary>u/austonst updates us on Aestus and timing games and u/haurog starts a great conversation with Auston</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fu8i74/daily_general_discussion_october_2_2024/lpxpmjj/)

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst):

*Also posted in r/ethstaker, but I don't think people will mind seeing it here too:*

I'd like to share an article I've written about what u/KuDeTa and I are doing with respect to block proposal timing games for the Aestus relay. We've been experimenting with timing games for a while and in the interest of transparency would like to share our motivation, proposer-configurable parameters, and a bit of data.

The full article is here: https://hackmd.io/@austonst-aestus/BJsvEoia6

It's a little long to copy directly onto Reddit, but I can provide and elaborate on the main points:

* Block proposal timing games are unavoidable; at this point the best outcome is ensuring democratized access to high-quality timing management tools.
* Aestus will apply a safe delay to all getHeader requests coming from validators identified by user agent.
* Aestus's default timing games implementation results in a median delay of 735 ms.
* Validators looking to be more conservative or more aggressive may customize parameters by appending `?headerDelay={ms}&headerCutoff={ms}` to the Aestus listing in their mev-boost relay list.
* We encourage staking pools and relays to be transparent about timing games.

If you need some background on timing games, I provide a few links at the start. Timing games aren't a good thing in general: they're zero-sum for proposers and basically negative-sum when you consider the impact on network health. You can draw reasonable comparisons to an iterated n-player prisoner's dilemma, where once you know a handful of actors are always going to defect, it's in your best interest to defect as well, if only to mitigate your losses.

But this isn't too different from mev-boost: if we can't solve the problem (without protocol changes) we can at least reduce the advantage sophisticated actors have over everyone else. And when it comes to timing games, implementing them on the relay side with a careful eye towards consensus health should accomplish this. The article should cover the rest.

----

To quickly address the current hot topic, the blob-shaped elephant in the room whose ISP strangles their upload bandwidth: yeah, relay-side timing games will delay block publication (that's the point), giving less time for blobs to propagate around the network. But when you accept a bid over mev-boost, *the relay*--with its well-connected clients and prime data center location--will be the one responsible for initial block propagation.

If you use mev-boost with relay-side timing games, the block may be delayed but you can trust the relay to propagate it fast. If you don't use mev-boost at all, your client will produce a block ASAP but you need to trust your own network to propagate it. The middle ground may be [more interesting](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1841214520896663887): mev-boost with timing games AND a `--min-bid` means you delay block production but may end up responsible for your own block propagation.

*If you're a validator concerned about local propagation after delays*, you could specify `?headerDelay=0` in your Aestus mev-boost entry to disable timing games at the cost of lowering bid value, though if you're doing that, make sure to also *remove* Ultrasound and BloXroute relays from your list, as they also run timing games (BloXroute does allow for timing configuration, but I think you need to pay for their validator gateway service separately). There's no point in making Aestus return a bid early if your mev-boost client is just going to sit there waiting 900 ms for the other relays' responses.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

I dislike every part of this, but unfortunately timing games are a reality. Thank you for the transparency, making a reasonable compromise and especially the possibility to change the defaults. I think currently there is very little incentive for solo stakers to actively optimize for timing games as the execution layer income is just a small part of the overall income. As far as I see this year execution income is slightly above 10% of the overall staking income, at least for the 20 random validators I checked, and increasing that by timing games by another 1-2 percentage points is not really a lot. At least for me it is not worth it to compromise the network integrity over it. Obviously there are different opinions about it. If the MEV opportunity increases again it might become a more substantial part of the revenue. I think overall it shows for how little reward some actors are ready to compromise the Network. Not really surprising, but just interesting to keep in mind.

Oh my god you guys. Who's cutting onions in here? ü•π

[Yes I'm coming to Hodlercon now!!!](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fl4c68/daily_general_discussion_september_20_2024/lo1w0kc/) I am at a loss for words with your generosity! I am so grateful to be a part of this wonderful community and the doots won't die until this subreddit dies or I do... (unless Reddit nukes my account or something, but I'm sure I'd find a way around it though). Anyway, through the incredibly kind funding, raising 1.2 ETH from from u/superphiz, u/allinat40, u/haurog, u/alexiskef, u/shiftli, u/KuDeTa, u/Gumpa-Bucky, u/austonst and u/da3vr, I will absolutely be seeing you all in Phuket!

As a token of my appreciation I will be sending out a POAP soon (please DM me if you donated from a CEX or not your POAP wallet with your preferred wallet). I also have some ideas for a special something to give each of you in person (please let me know if any of you won't be at Hodlercon). Nothing big, but hopefully something meaningful, think of it like a physical POAP. No promises just yet but I've got an idea of something I may be able to do.

I have already checked and I can definitely change my flight for minimal extra cost. I still need to figure out the logistics, ie can I fly out of Phuket to Aus/NZ or do I need to go back to Bangkok but it seems I can change my flight and get credit for another flight for no extra cost! This just leaves any extra cost for getting to Phuket, the Hodlercon ticket, accommodation, food and airport parking for an extra week. All of which I have no reason to believe will go over my newly increased budget.

I also just want to say it was impressive/bold of you all to remember/have faith that tricky.eth was indeed my address. I have rarely mentioned that and it could've gone very wrong if you had the wrong address haha.

Finally, I just want to say that this community never disappoints and all of the work being done around the doots now with the podcast is incredibly motivating for me. I love to see the awesome things coming to fruition out from this community and I hope this is just the beginning.

<summary>u/haurog covers some big Pectra changes</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fncsy5/daily_general_discussion_september_23_2024/lohnj3l/)

In the all Core Devs Consensus call last Thursday they discussed the size of the upcoming Pectra Fork. They pretty much decided to make the Pectra fork much smaller again and split it into two hard forks. In essence all the EIPs that are currently being live on devnets (i.e. internal testnets) will be bundled into the first upgrade, whereas anything not part of these devnets will get its own hard fork later on. The reasoning is that the EIPs that are currently tested will soon be ready for public testnets and then mainnet. Waiting for the other EIPs to be ready would delay these upgrades by several months. More details about the reasoning can be found here: https://hackmd.io/@ralexstokes/rJVuKtlpR

As it currently stands it is planned to have the the following EIPS in Pectra 1

- EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations

- EIP-2935: Save historical block hashes in state

- EIP-6110: Supply validator deposits on chain

- EIP-7002: Execution layer triggerable exits

- EIP-7251: Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE

- EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation

- EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests

- EIP-7702: Set EOA account code for one transaction

Most important for stakers are the maxEB (EIP 7251) and EL triggerable exits (EIP 7002) changes. These two allow a single validator to have up to 2048 ETH in balance and the advantage that one can trigger a validator exit by signing a message from the withdrawal address. The account abstraction EIP (7702) is interesting as it allows and EOA account to behave like a smart contract account. There is also the discussion to include a smaller change which would increase the Blob target and max from the current 3/6 to either 4/6 or higher numbers. But there is no consensus about this yet.  

Notably absent from this list are the bigger EIPs (PeerDAS and EOF). This means we are pretty much at the size of Pectra as it was initially planned (until May 2024), right before the size blew up massively by including PeerDAS and EOF. The plan is to have the first upgrade at the beginning of next year (q1/q2) whereas the second upgrade with PeerDAS and EOF would be at the end of next year. Obviously this still is in discussion so details might change. No idea what this means for the already scoped Verkle tree upgrade which is a large execution layer change which was planned to come afterwards. I guess the next few weeks will give more clarity.

<summary>u/benido2030 starts a discussion about decentralised sequencers for L2s</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fo4r11/daily_general_discussion_september_24_2024/lonpou1/)

The [bankless episode with Mike Neuder](https://www.bankless.com/in-defense-of-the-ethereum-roadmap-mike-neuder) was pretty interesting. I am not yet done, but one thing caught my attention: I think we discussed centralized sequencers here probably years ago and pointed out that these aren't perfect, but that we expect some L2s to have only one sequencer that will do all the work and that there will be some decentralized L2s. My mental model from these discussions was "there will be a bit of everything". 

Mike yesterday basically said that he expects "all" (most) L2s to have a decentralized sequencer **and** that it is the best strategy for them, because they won't be more decentralized than L1, inherit all the necessary properties from l1 and shouldn't even try emphasize that dimension. His conclusion is more or less that real-time censorship resistance is cool (which is the result of decentralized sequencing), but it's probably not as important with the possibility of forced inclusion via L1. 

Is a decentralized sequencer only important in our bubble? The more I think about, the more I believe it is - and we are a niche, so developing for us and similar users might be good enough for one or two L2s, but that's it. So will we see 99.9% of the sequencers running on one machine?

It's gonna keep happening. Excess supply of blockspace will eventually be gobbled up. Even if it's to do the same stuff but leaner, easier, more user friendly.

> We saw something similar with our computers and the internet. As the resources available were scaled up, the computers didn't get much faster to do the same things we were doing. And web pages didn't load up faster. Instead, a lot of those extra new resources went into nicer UX and cheaper/easier to deliver code. We are in the era of smart contract programmers thinking long and hard about how they implement the functionality to minimize gas costs, looking at OPCODES and trying find microoptimizations to squeeze those extra gas savings. There was a time when programmers thought long and hard about the performance of their applications and would often go to assembly to optimize them. For most use cases programmers don't do that anymore because CPU cycles have become so cheap that it's silly to optimize for that. The same will happen with blockspace, as it becomes cheaper and cheaper we will start to use it less efficiently in exchange for improved UX or easier code.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal covers a bit of a brick wall for hobbyist developers</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fo4r11/daily_general_discussion_september_24_2024/loqy6yd/)

As a casual hobbyist developer, I keep hitting a wall at the block explorer verification step.

You can write just about any smart contract idea you have by messing around in Remix IDE. You can deploy it to the blockchain. It will run on its own forever on a permissionless network for everyone to interact with. Thirdparties can even build more stuff on top of your contracts. Amazing!

But the moment you want to make your code easy to check on a centralized block explorer? There's this huge skill bump, where you need to use the command line, install git/nodejs/npm/truffle/hardhat/scoop/foundry and a million of other things, and none of it works anyway.

Well, I say "you", it is of course "me", dumb old me who never gets this stuff.

But, still, isn't this wild? Intuitively it feels like the hard part would be, you know, building the actual thing? Rather than proving the thing you built is what you say it is. 

Imports used to be my main grievance. Now I'm discovering the fresh hell that is --via-ir verification. At least now I have AI... To help me fail faster.

-- edit: finally found a way! Nothing like a good rant in public to have a breakthrough.

For any other tortured soul who might end up in the same situation, the working path was

1) "generate contract metadata" ticked on in Remix IDE

2) get the giganormous hexadecimal .json in artifacts/build-info folder

3) crop its contents to keep just the "language", "settings" and "sources" bits

4) on the block explorer verification page, use Solidity Standard-Json-Input in the compiler type dropdown panel

5) It Just Works.

The world is saved. Praise Vitalik. Praise all of you. I love you all. Good night.

<summary>u/nick_badlands rambles about where we are this cycle</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fl4c68/daily_general_discussion_september_20_2024/lo4i1s5/)

> "It's different this time"

Just sharing some ramblings to help me solidify my theory on where we go from here.

I was a bit worried for a while, when the hype of the Bitcoin ETFs was going on it all got a bit too excited, too quick for me for a while, I was slightly concerned the 4 year cycle wasn't gonna happen as usual.

We seem to be back on course.  Bitcoin still rules the jungle (for now) so what is happening with it still matters deeply for Ethereum.  

Rate cuts have started in the US, the rest of the world has largely yet to follow course but they will as the cycle turns.  Gold is rising and Peter Schiff is getting all excited about it but what usually follows after this is Bitcoin making him eat his words.  Pretty sure this will happen again.

In my gut, I think there is one more big drop still to come, there is usually some event that scares people witless before we go to Valhalla.  Would love to be wrong on this and we go straight there from this but it fits the usual pattern.  From there we start marching on with Bitcoin leading the charge.

Next what happens is money starts to look elsewhere and the fabled Altcoin season has its time to shine.  I think Ethereum will start attracting attention sooner rather than later and considering the hate it seems to be getting lately, it will be a glorious, hated rally by those who miss out.  

I'm sure others will pump but I'm not worried by the likes of Solana etc.  It's still a centralised shitcoin that's good for meme coins but anything else?  Pretty sure it will go the way of EoS, Cardano and all the other so called Eth killers in the long term.

I've been staying well way from buying any crypto other than BTC/ETH since the 2017 cycle and sure I've missed out on shit but I'm in it for the long haul.

We have ETH ETFs and we've moved to PoS so all those ESG/green funds can take part that can't in Bitcoin.

We have scale this time, L2s are growing and growing.

Crypto is getting easier and easier to use.

Still waiting to see what the next narrative will be, we had ICOs, DEFI, NFTs all started on Ethereum to kick things off before, what will be next?  Is it time for the long talked about real-world assets to enter the party this time?

Ignore all the noise, am pretty sure that we see a great bull market starting as per the usual 4 year cycle.  I might even sell some of my precious ETH for the first time this time around :)

<summary>u/haurog brings a write up expanding on the disconnect of knowledge on a recent podcast</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fowp6i/comment/lotrw6t/)

I have finished the recent bankless episode with Max Resnick called "Is the Ethereum Roadmap Off Track?": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLUJ0uLye0U

I knew it will be difficult to listen to for me and I ranted about the guest a bit here before. It is mostly due to the guest being unable to contribute in any meaningful way to the discussion and making false statements everywhere. Now that I have finished it, my conclusion is: should we really listen to someone on their opinions about rollups who seems to have such a gross misunderstanding how this stuff works. He might have very good opinions about the MEV part of the roadmap or about auctions, I cannot judge that but he seems unable to understand how the rollup part really works.

I keep it to the largest issues I have heard and leave out many smaller wrong statements the guest made. To be very clear, my understanding of rollups has a lot of gaps, so please correct me if I am stating something wrong here I am eager to be corrected and learn. 

After the 55 minute mark he states

> ZK technology inherently compresses the state whereas the optimistic rollups have to put the transactions on chain and maybe they can run a little bit of compression but it's not nearly the amount of compression you can get with uh ZK roll up

Wrong. There is no compression in ZK technology used today in rollups. The zk part just gives a relatively short string of numbers and characters which prove that the ~~calculation~~ state transitions has been done right. There is no extractable information about the state in this proof. Both rollup types have to put all transactions on chain via blobs. Many people use the simplified term 'compression' to get the meaning across, but this is not an accurate description of what is happening in the case of ZK rollups. It really seems like Max took the marketing term of ZK is compression and went with it without understanding what is happening and to draw his conclusions based on this flawed understanding. To make matters worse optimistic rollups do have less overhead in the calldata as they do not have to publish a fraud proof. So it is actually the exact inverse from what he says. Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of zk rollups and really hope they will dominate in the coming years. Max is just wrong here from a technical point.

> let let me just be very precise that optimistic rollup does not actually substantially reduce the amount of bandwidth required

This is very wrong the bandwidth requirement can get reduced by the same amount in zk rollups and optimistic rollups. They both publish all transactions in the same way into blobs. They can employ the same optimization techniques to reduce the size of this blob data. Zk rollups have a slight overhead so use a bit more bandwidth. If he would have read/understood vitaliks post about rollups he would know that: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html 

> like we can start to build uh ZK compression into the L1 as well and that would reduce the bandwidth requirements

Again the 'compression' which does not really exist. But on the L1 ZK technology can be used to massively reduce the bandwidth and still validate that the state transition has been applied correctly. The node would not know the actual state but it could validate that it is correct. Like the Mina L1 does zk proofs of their state transitions. So, the statement is only half wrong.

> from a bandwidth perspective you have almost the same usage from a optimistic L2 as you would if it was happening on the layer one and the only thing you're saving is on execution

Bandwidth argument is wrong, as explained above. One massively saves on execution in both cases of rollups though. 

I think his misunderstanding of the ZK part in zk rollups works fits into his initial rant at the beginning of the episode where he accused the EF and companies behind optimistic rollups to have pushed a roadmap which is against zk rollups. If one does not understand what zk rollups really need it is a bit bold to accuse someone of pushing a wrong roadmap which actually massively benefits zk rollups as well.

> we do need to take some tools from the newer blockchains one of them in particular is this kind of parallel execution

Parallel exection is already part of Besu: https://besu.hyperledger.org/development/public-networks/concepts/parallel-transaction-execution

> if optimism is not arbitrum then by the transitive property cannot also be the case that optimism is ethereum and arbitrum is ethereum because then arbitrum would be optimism this is like a fundamental contradiction

I am just weirded out by this statement as the transitive relation in mathematics is not really something I would apply here to try to prove something. It is pretty normal to have a  subgroup being part of a bigger group but two subgroups not being the same. I am thinking about the taxonomy hierarchy in biology. A lion and a tiger are not the same species, but they still belong to the same genus called 'panthera'. That is how I think about the Ethereum ecosystem and the rollups. This is not really an important statement by him it just shows that he is using vocabulary to sound more important but applying things in a way which does not really make too much sense. 

Rant finished. I now definitely have a worse opinion about him because he does hold strong opinions about things which he apparently does not really understand. This makes it very hard to judge if his opinions are worth considering as one cannot really say from his statements where the limit of his knowledge is. Everything has the same strong absolute language there is no nuance, nothing. And only if one perfectly understands the underlying technology one can judge if his statement makes sense. That is not very helpful for most people at all.

<summary>u/superphiz says good bye to Danny Ryan(for now) through the help of POAPs</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fpojgj/comment/lp0pocq/)

Yesterday I announced the "Goodbye Danny" POAP, it's a POAP to appreciate the contributions of Danny Ryan, the person who is most responsible for the Ethereum beacon chain as we know it. 

It's launching with a new POAP platform, called "Airship". Airship lets you send funds to an address to receive a POAP without the need to connect to any web3 browser wallet. Effectively, if you send 0.001 Ether (exactly $5.00 at today's prices) to theprotocolguild.eth on mainnet, you will receive the POAP in about a minute. This is kind of a cool evolution and I'm excited to see where it will go.

<https://airship.poap.xyz/danny>

\* Also, I definitely encourage gaming this to get the POAP with a minimal gas cost. How low can you go? The worst that could happen is a dropped tx and you can just try again later.

\*\* depending on how well you know this stuff, setting a very low gas price can effectively get your wallet stuck since all transactions are processed in order. There are ways around this, but i didn't want to surprise anyone.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard has some thoughts on EigenLayer's security model</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fowp6i/comment/lox135m/)

Some thoughts on [EigenLayer's Operator Set](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/introducing-the-eigenlayer-security-model/) security model.

AVSs assign operators to operating sets. I don't know if this means that by default all AVSs are whitelist only but it certainly reads that way. It's not the epitome of permissionless if true.

Stakers delegate stake to operators. How do stakers find an operator to delegate to? At the moment there's a list on the EigenLayer website which basically means EigenLayer can exclude an operator from participating just by censoring them here. At the protocol level though I don't believe they have any power so it's just like Uniswap with their front end which I guess is good enough. The bigger problem though is *why* does a staker trust an operator to delegate to them. At the moment the only answer here is trust. You are either trusting someone you know like Aestus or you are trusting an LRT to underwrite for you, KYC your operators, etc. We need a better answer here.

Operators then assign unique stake to operator sets. The goal here seems to be to prevent restaked ETH from being restaked multiple times which is confusing to me. It's already the case that the underlying stake securing a task can become unbacked, why is it suddenly different if it becomes unbacked within EigenLayer rather than at the LST level? The proper answer here is that capital should be reusable to the extent that the cost of dishonesty still outweighs the profit from dishonesty. The cost of dishonesty is the stake being slashed. The profit from dishonesty scales with the amount of promises you're allowed to make with that stake. I don't see how this security model is even attempting to discover a rational answer to that equation.

Within an operator set, operators are expected to vote on whether the answers of other operators are correct. Their vote is weighted by the stake they assigned to that operator set. The thing that *feels* wrong about this design is we are using restaked ETH as a Sybil resistance source when the nature of being an operator on an AVS consists of doing provable work. Why not just use the proof of work as the Sybil resistance source for this? I have the same feedback for subnets on BitTensor. Why do we need validators for that at all when the miners have the hardware to validate and the miners have to do work so the system can't be Sybiled?

They state that if a malicious operator takes over the operator set the system can slash him. I assume this refers to the EIGEN governance system above the AVS but they aren't explicit about this. All they say is that the only stake at risk within an operator set is the stake assigned to the operator set. I refer to stake voting schemes as subjective consensus. Ultimately, even with objective proof systems it still comes down to who runs what software e.g. Ethereum layer 0, but why involve local operator set at all at that point since the EIGEN governance system participants will apparently be required to host all the proof-validators for all AVSs since operators in every AVS will be allowed to appeal to them? If the goal is to reduce the computational load on the EIGEN governance system participants then I'd say you should first vote using PoW within an operator set then appeal to a contest amongst all the operator sets on the matter and every appeal should require slashable stake to initiate. That looks a lot more like the Colony governance design than what I just read. It's also worth noting that an operator only needs to be slashed in an eventually consistent way so zk-proofs that rely on repeated games are perfectly valid here. There's a long unlock period for validators to unstake from AVSs.

I also don't know what happens in this model if a staker undelegates to an operator. Which operator sets is the unique stake removed from? Is it proportionate, LIFO, etc? And how does stake affect rewards? Can an operator just forfeit their operator set consensus power but do honest work without any unique stake and still be rewarded? There's just a lot of undefined aspects to this system at the moment.

GM EthFam, I've got an idea, feel free to veto it, but hear me out first...

Premise 1: We are pretty well represented in many of the biggest DAOs: https://dailydoots.com/#delegates;

Premise 2: Those DAO's control treasuries worth over $20 billion: https://deepdao.io/organizations;

Premise 3: To successfully take over 50% of Bitcoin's hashrate (either by buying ASICs or setting up facilities to manufacture them yourself) would cost ~ $20 billion: https://blockchainbeat.co/how-much-to-hack-bitcoin-and-ethereum-study-reveals-price/;

Conclusion: EthFinance should orchestrate the take down of Bitcoin, then the annoying trolls that have been showing up here the last few days would be less obnoxious, mods would have less work to do, and the daily threads would be less cluttered.

<summary>u/benido2030 digs up a ZKSync delegate mystery</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ffmt2l/daily_general_discussion_september_13_2024/lmwbgz5/)

zksync governance went live yesterday. There are no proposals yet, but at least everything seems to be set up technically. Since I am one of the ETHFinance delegates, I had been visiting the page regularly to check for updates. That's why I noticed some interesting changes in voting power, some examples:

- Stani (from AAVE): 9M in August, 45M in September

- Baki Er: 12M in August, 61M in September

- polynya: 8M in August, 38M in September

2 of the top 3 delegates (syncswap, l2beat and olimpio) are more or less unchanged with the exception of L2beat. They have more than doubled in voting power (from 47M to 106M)

For Stani and Baki Er the changes are perfectly visible in the [chart on the right hand side here](https://vote.zknation.io/gov/zksync/delegates). For polynya I checked the "Received Delegations" tab in their [delegate profile](https://vote.zknation.io/dao/delegate/polynya.eth). All three profiles show basically the same, huge delegations on both the September 9th and September 12th. 

So where do all these delegated tokens come from? The biggest delegation to polynya is from [this account](https://vote.zknation.io/dao/delegate/0x3e371a236718417af324acefa6122f00f11750c6) which is basically non-existent onchain according to the [zksync explorer](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x3e371a236718417af324acefa6122f00f11750c6). It received the zk tokens 3 months ago from a wallet that received 6999999300 zk tokens and has been transfering the tokens to a lot of new addresses. I did a quick check and most of these accounts don't show any activity. The top delegations to both Stani and Baki Er from the past couple of days show basicalyl the exact same patterns...

With some basic maths we can see that 6.9B is basically 33% of the total supply - which makes me think, this is likely the wallet that distributes to team and investors, because according to this [blog post](https://blog.zknation.io/zk-token/) that's the only receiving party that makes sense? 

So are these changes in voting power just team members and investors delegating their (locked) tokens just before governance goes live? Did zksync just tell everyone to delegate? I don't see any other explanation, but maybe I am completely off? Any other ideas?

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fgelps/daily_general_discussion_september_14_2024/ln1uf9v/)

The US SEC backpeddled and finally admitted that cryptocurrencies are not "securities" but simply "crypto assets".

There were multiple articles that covered this yesterday:

* Be In Crypto: [SEC Clarifies What Crypto Asset Securities Means ](https://beincrypto.com/sec-crypto-asset-securities/)
* Cointelegraph: [SEC 'regrets any confusion' from dubbing tokens as securities: filing](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-regrets-confusion-dubbing-tokens-securities)

* Crypto News: [SEC backtracks on 'crypto asset securities' claim in Binance suit](https://crypto.news/sec-backtracks-on-crypto-asset-securities-claim-in-binance-suit/)

In summary, the SEC admitted that they didn't consider cryptocurrencies as "securities" but as "crypto assets". (Note that this only applies within the US, and many other countries never classified crypto as securities in the first place but as "digital assets".)

> "With its use of the term 'crypto asset securities,' the SEC is not referring to the crypto asset itself as the security," the agency said. Instead, a token‚Äôs status as a security "consists of the full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of the [crypto asset]," it said, citing language from an earlier filing.

Thus cryptocurrencies are not securities, but how they're offered along with contracts and expectations can be considered securities.

That's what Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and the entire crypto community have been saying all along, and it took the SEC this long to finally admit it in court.

Google is coming further and further into the web3 game. They started supporting ENS addresses some time ago and directly show a summary of the address in the search results. Today they announced that they provide Ethereum RPC endpoints for developers for mainnet and testnets: <https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/financial-services/introducing-blockchain-rpc-service-for-web3-builders>

I guess this is a continuation of what started a year ago when they becam part of the holesky genesis validators and they run 10k holesky validators: <https://
explorer.rated.network/o/Google%20Cloud%20Web3?network=holesky&timeWindow=1d&idType=nodeOperator>

This new announcement is in direct competition to Alchemy, Infura and all the other commercial RPC providers. Pretty impressive how these large companies enter the Ethereum ecosystem bit by bit. And this time it is definitely not because of a hype they have to sell to their shareholders but probably rather strategically to get a foot into the door of the Ethereum space.

Crypto is full of amazing heights and soul-crushing lows. The fact that there have been multiple 90% drops and it is still the best performing asset class in the last decade is incredible. However, you can't always afford to ride it out. The crypto highs and lows tend to follow the macro highs and lows. So when crypto is low you're also jobless, economic opportunities are scarce, and you're scared. If you invest more than you can afford to lose when times are good, you could very well be one of the millions who find themselves selling while the market is down only to watch it do some crazy 30x the next cycle. People not following this advice is the source of the bitterness every time crypto comes up on your Facebook feed or technology subreddit. The problem was never crypto, the problem was *they invested more than they could afford to lose*.

*Pay Taxes As You Go*

This is actually just a specific case of the above point but I think it bears special mention. It's one thing to be penniless. It's another to be in debt. It's another still to be *in debt to the government*. The first case is miserable but you can still live on credit. The second case is bankruptcy and homelessness. The third case is debtor's prison. You cannot afford to invest money you owe for taxes into speculative assets. Therefore, whenever you rotate positions you should take whatever sum you need to to cover the taxes out to safer havens.

The specific case that wrecks people has to do with a crash just after the start of a new year like happened in... well 2018 and 2022. Just before the crash everyone rotates their capital back into the blue chip coins. When this happens even though they are reducing risk they are now selling something and buying something else at near all-time-high valuations. Then the crash hits, they tell themselves it's just a bear trap and don't sell, and by the time the tax bill is due they can't even liquidate their entire portfolio to pay the tax bill. Seriously, it's just less stressful to *pay taxes as you go*.

*No One Is Giving Away Free Crypto*

Whenever anything of significance happens in crypto some scammer always replies to the announcement to say "To celebrate X event we're giving away free crypto. Send scamAddress some coins and get twice that back!". This is a ridiculously stupid scam that has gotten a ridiculously stupid amount of money. I seriously can't fathom how this bullshit has managed to pull in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto. Sometimes I feel like people who lose money to this type of thing deserve to do so. Mostly though I just feel sad for how this money is going to power the next wave of scams to be that much more prevalent and effective. They do this because it works and they are never going to stop.

Let me make this abundantly clear. I have been around awhile. I have been around for many significant events in crypto. No one reputable is **ever** giving away free ETH. For any reason. **Ever**. I don't care if their account name is Elon Musk and you think he's so eccentric he might actually be doing it. I don't care if they have a blue checkmark next to their name and it appears to be the same account as the one making the announcement. I don't care if it says its part of a fun new airdrop they are doing. **Ever**.

More generally, even in an ecosystem where 1000% gains aren't uncommon, if it looks too good to be true, that's because it is. If you see some 1000% yield LP position on some token you've never heard of it's almost certainly being fueled by inflation and you are gambling against the loss of value of your collateral. If you see some stablecoin position with unusually high yield that stablecoin probably isn't stable. If it actually is using a safe collateral and is on a safe platform and isn't a scam it's either a very new position and is about to be quickly diluted or it's being fueled by someone's marketing budget and is about to be quickly diluted.

Whether in web2 or web3, if you don't understand how you're adding value to an ecosystem you're the product. When you receive airdrops, you are being compensated for being an early user, taking early risks, boosting the numbers the team uses for valuations so they can get more funding, etc. Even legit airdrops that you can sell the day you get them are not free crypto. *No one is giving away free crypto*.

*Inflation Is Not Profit*

Every bull market in crypto has been marked by certain design patterns in tokenomics. I can mostly tell you a time range when a token was launched by its tokenomics alone like how an archeologist can tell you which civilization some ruins come from by pointing at architecture and art styles. One of those design trends in early 2021 was to launch highly inflationary tokens and then use high APR numbers to encourage people to buy the token and stake it for rewards. This was basically just a new type of casino. Your net worth would go down even as the number of tokens you hold went up 10x a year. This was basically preying on the ignorance of users who didn't really understand finance but it worked for a time while the profit the hype generated was able to expand the user base faster than the inflation rate. Once the model ran out of users to expand to the rest was history.[1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus)[2](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/klima-dao)[3](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemix)[4](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tokemak) Whenever you see a high APR in some LP or staking pool you need to slow down and investigate where the money is coming from. If it's coming from inflation you need to understand that *inflation is not profit*.

*If It's Good Enough For a Screenshot, Take Profit*

As volatile as crypto is there will come a time where you are massively up. You'll be up so much you will be in disbelief. You will refresh your portfolio checker every 15 minutes and the person sitting across the table from you will know you're doing it again because the green from the screen will reflect from your eyes. At this point, they will think you have a problem. At this point you actually do have a problem but that's besides the point. Here's the thing: you aren't a genius. Even if you actually are a genius you aren't up because you are a genius. It's just that time of the cycle.

At that time of the cycle everything you'll see in your media feed will reinforce how much of a genius you are. It's like the whole world just woke up and finally saw what you saw first. However, if you haven't heard this yet let me be the first to tell you: **sentiment follow price**. People love the investment now because it is up. If the price wasn't up, you'd still be waiting like you were when you first bought. 90% of those investments everyone seems to agree can't possibly fail are destined for the dustbin of history. Ever heard of Feathercoin? If you were around at the time you couldn't not hear about it. How about EOS? OmiseGo? Luna? None of these things are going to be top 100 again. When prices are up, everyone is a genius. At the end of the cycle when you're holding the bag you won't feel like it any more.

How will you know when the top is? If there was a numeric answer to that then we'd all just sell then and the top would come sooner. The game theory of that makes the price chart look highly chaotic at the tops. The best answer I can give you having lived through some unbelievable peaks and valleys is *if it's good enough for a screenshot, take profit*.

*Leverage Will Fuck You Up*

Leverage in crypto takes many forms. We have all kinds of financial gizmos you've probably never heard of and which you'll take years to acclimate to. Like, yes, we have options protocols but we also have rate stripping futures protocols, perpetual swaps, and leveraged derivatives. The leverage around here goes to 100x and it all seems to get more complicated and interwoven every year.

Regardless of the form of leverage though, the goal is to amplify the effect of a market change on your portfolio. This is all well and good when you're dealing with something like bond rates that adjust like 0.25% a month and you can just afford to wait to expiry if you're wrong. Waiting it out is basically what banks are doing right now and why their unrealized loss chart looks like [blood dripping down a painting](https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-09/qbp2-2024-chart7.png). Crypto assets are more volatile. You're not just playing with gasoline here; this stuff might as well be nuclear. I wouldn't advise you to play with the nuclear bomb without knowing what you're doing. I don't care if it has a red button that says "Press Me for Limitless Energy". I wouldn't advise you to play with crypto leverage either even if their website has a fun points system.

Applying leverage to crypto assets, means amplifying the financial effect of something that is already known to drop by over 90% and with rate swings in the thousands of percentage points over a year. If you aren't right, continuously right without any blips, you won't be waiting this out. You'll be liquidated. I have seen too many veterans fall to the hubris of thinking the price can't possible fall to X level. Then, for one brief candle of intense market fear it does and they've lost more than they've bargained for. Before you play with leverage you should have a forecast for what the market will do that justifies taking such a risk. You should have contingency plans to execute on if your prediction isn't coming true in the timeframe you expect. Don't let it linger on until you feel like it's a sunk cost. Definitely don't double down. Every time you sign a transaction involving leverage repeat this in your head: *leverage will fuck you up*.

*Get Rich Slow*

This last one summarizes the spirit of all the above advice. Thriving in this ecosystem is first and foremost about survival. Surviving is often a matter of having a clear head and assessing risks rationally when everyone else isn't. That requires having your emotions under control. Whenever you take any extreme action you are going to experience extreme emotions about it. Those emotions will cause you to act rashly. This is how you end up scammed, overexposed and holding shitcoins you don't honestly believe in, having missed the top of the cycle without taking profit because everything seemed so bullish, being liquidated at the bottom, in debt to the government, and joining the ranks of the disillusioned about what is otherwise a wonderful civilization changing technology. Life is a marathon. You are only racing yourself. Take the time to learn before taking big risks. Don't try to get rich quick here. *Get rich slow*.

<summary>u/vedran_ explains a new protocol which leverages ZK Proofs with identity</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fjkzpm/daily_general_discussion_september_18_2024/lnps1qu/)

Interesting news on the application front. I came across [Rarimo protocol](https://mirror.xyz/0x90699B5A52BccbdFe73d5c9F3d039a33fb2D1AF6/1JSk1fvRwpfUQhLZt1OlaBpVDkXIutVYYXdYgaukh0c), which is building **ZK passport-based voting**. In this post, I'll concentrate on proof of identity aspect of voting. Proof of identity is a stronger guaranty than [proof of personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood).

I've been intrigued in leveraging government issued documents as a proof of identity for a while. Yes, government issued.  Blasphemy! First of all, I've been disappointed with current web3 approaches to proof of identity. Ones based on monetary incentives - ‚ÄúIf the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.‚Äù Social recovery - not that I delved too deep - seems gameable. Dedicated piece of hardware to scan biometric features - maybe. Think about it, which entities have always had the problem with uniquely identifying a person? Who are the incumbent identity providers? Governments, banks, and lately IT companies like Google, Twitter, FB...("Sign in with Google"...).

Right of the bat, IT company's proof of identity is shit. You can easily sibyl it. Banks - much beater. Having a bank card pretty much means you are a person or a legal entity and not a bot. Nobody can take your money if they don't scam you. Thing is, banks rely on government issued documents. Who caries the burden of identifying a person from the moment they are born? Can they enroll in a school? Can they cross a border? Did they pay taxes? Are the eligible for health care? Important stuff, right? Governments have been doing this for a long time. They have institutions on institutions for making sure that you are who you say you are. The world works thanks to them having done a decent job.

As we enter the third millennium, machine readable government documents have become a thing. Biometric passports are standardized ([ICAO Doc 9303](https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303)). Almost [all the countries in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport#List_of_biometric_passports) now issue passports compliant with this protocol. 

Rarimo developed the [Freedom tool](https://freedomtool.org/#/) - opensource, ZK powered, mobile app which scans your passport and creates a user profile. It claims to preserve authenticity, eligibility, anonymity and uniqueness. The [whitepaper](https://freedomtool.org/#/doc) addressed security claims and assumptions.

Thanks to ZK proofs, you could prove claims about yourself, without giving away unnecessary  personal information. You could prove that you are of legal age, without giving away any other info, including your identity. Are you a resident of certain country? Are you human and not a bot? 

Proper digital identity unlocks a lot of applications web3 people have been talking about: voting, reputation systems, user profiles, social networks...These are the use cases which cannot be tackled with crypto-economics alone. What do you think?

Edit: grammar.

<summary>u/benido2030 makes a good point about hardware wallets and u/haurog builds off their comment.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fkd3pr/daily_general_discussion_september_19_2024/lnv4luq/)

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

I am bearish hardware wallets. Obviously smart contract wallets are getting way better, which is one reason. But if a nation state can manipulate 1000s of small electronic devices and people don't find out until it's too late, they can manipulate hardware wallets as well. 

This is just a general thought. But be aware of the risks.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

The only thing I can say is that when you become a target of one of the larger 3 letter agencies or equivalent governmental (emphasis on 'mental') agencies of some countries there is pretty much nothing you can do. They will get to you, get all your assets and only if you go to the most extreme lengths you might be able to prevent that.

We know since the Snowden revelations that the NSA has an internal catalogue where you can order 'replacement' parts which then get exchanged during shipment of an order to the target. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_catalog This is happening by diverting the shipment to a unknown location, replace part of the electronics device with an NSA produced one and then continue the shipment to the customer which obviously is not aware of any diversions or replacements. As far as I remember they also had ready made casing which included a spy device for the most popular laptops and electronic devices.

I guess the same thing could happen with a hardware wallet. But to be honest I expect it to be easier for them to monitor your used wallets, get a list of your addresses and get to the seed phrases afterwards when they arrest you. Most people will have it written down somewhere. Sure you can always just keep your seed phrase in your head (brainwallet) but I guess only a very small fraction of crypto users really go that far.

For them getting in your hot wallet will probably be easier than attacking a hardware wallet. So, a hot wallet is not safer at all.

If the goal is to attack the chain itself by compromising thousands of hardware wallets. I am pretty sure they could do that. Not sure what the legality of this would be, but hey as history and current events show these agencies have a different legal rulebook than most of us have to follow.

I still think having hardware wallet in some form is one of the best defense one can have. Normal hackers will not be able to get to the private keys as they ideally never leave the device (hello ledger).  If you pair it with a smart contract multisig wallet where an attacker would have to attack several hot wallets or even hardware wallets at the same time I deem it pretty much impossible that you will lose your ETH due to a supply chain attack.

<summary>u/Ber10 explains why the ratio matters</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fjkzpm/daily_general_discussion_september_18_2024/lnr0t2r/)

The ratio matters for me because objectively Ethereum is better at everything that Bitcoin does. There is no reason why Bitcoin is a better SoV. And this reality has to be reflected in the ratio at some point. BTC is very flawed and is not sustainable. A BTC failure without profound change is inevitable. It is absolutely perplexing that the market does not realize this. I dont care about Dollar price as much because I think the crypto space realizing whats important is the first step on the journey. I care about the ratio because it reflects the market realizing rational facts.

Its not about money. I care about the future of human society and about the improvement of our society.  And I honestly believe that only Ethereum can deliver a credibly neutral trustless financial system a bedrock for finance that can not be corrupted. I want this platform to succeed because it will improve the world. Finally a level playing field that can be set up in a way that empowers people and organizations and stops corrupt governments. Its can be a counterweight for fraud and corruption and government overreach.

That is why I am into crypto. That is my main focus. So I care aboout the ratio because Bitcoin is the wrong way. And Solana is the wrong way as none of them can deliver what is needed.

A financial system that is trustless and can cater to the entire planet. Ethereum is on its way to achieve this. Aslong as Bitcoin ratio is so bad it means people are not realizing what the purpose of blockchain technology is and people did not realize what tools they have at their disposal to manage their finances in a way that can not be tampered with.

Yes obviously we are not there yet, Ethereum has many many flaws, but we are on the path to it. And the ratio is an indicator for blockchain technology to actually fullfill its purpose.

Holding coins that can not be deflated (Bitcoin will fail at this btw) is just part of the equation. People using crypto for everything that banks usually do for crypto to replace centralized systems. That is what I want. I want traditional companies to be either replaced or reorganized on Ethereum rails. I want the upper people to slowly distribute their power to more people.

Blockchain did not achieve anything yet. Its just the start the very first day of a century long journey. And the ratio is an indicator when we are out of phase 1. Realizing why blockchains are valuable. We are still in Phase 1 where the people do not know why blockchain is important.

For me its not about money. Its about change. And the ratio is an indicator for that change.

If Ethereum does not flip Bitcoin. Then blockchains are useless and its really just a speculative meme coin casino. And nothing more.

Bitcoin for me is the nr1 meme coin. It has a strong narrative but it fails at real world utility and is not designed to be sustainable long term. It needs centralized entities to offer services thus the fact that its decentralized matters only in so far that it cant be inflated arbitrarily. However the security of the protocol is dependent on the inflation so the system is about to fail.

Ethereum flipping Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming the most expensive asset on this planet is when we will be able to see crypto change the world profoundly. And thats all I want. Everything else. Is just secondary. I do have enough money. I dont need a Bugatti. I do have a job. I want Ethereum specifically to be a guarantee for a free and open Internet/monetary system that can not be censored. I want entitities like EU China America Google Facebook Apple AGI to not have total control to have to deal with a platform that they can not censor and that wont be corrupted by them. I want Ethereum to be that strong. We are not there yet but we could be one day. And flipping Bitcoin is the first step on that journey.

Seems outlandish but this was the reason why I even got interested in Crypto in the first place. The prospect of that happening. And Bitoin dropped the ball by ossifying too early and just focusing on an unsustainable inflation schedule.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll made some cool new user flairs</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fhwp53/daily_general_discussion_september_16_2024/lnitff3/)

[A good while ago I told you all I am slow to get around to things but I wanted to add some default user flairs.](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e7nt2y/daily_general_discussion_july_20_2024/le2sqzp/) Well, as prophesied, I was indeed slow to get round to it. But lo and behold, ***we now have default user flairs!***

The new ones have some colour where the old custom ones didn't. Custom ones are still an option, they just won't be as colourful as the default flairs. Also, these default ones should give us a good idea of your vibe. if you're new, a TA guy, long term investor etc. Hopefully we can get a better feel for what angle you're coming from when you make a post here. At the end of the day we want less conflict and hopefully a bit of context as to your leanings might help a bit. If not, it's still just a bit of fun. Feel free to grab a meme flair if that's your style!

Finally, I'm happy to add some more, so let me know what you want to see added and maybe even a colour request (send me ur hex codes üòâ). Though I think we might reserve one colour for the mods. Maybe we can colour coordinate our flairs. Currently it's a bright ugly shade of blue so you're not missing out on much.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fbq2nu/daily_general_discussion_september_8_2024/lm37s8b/)

I recently got to feel like a whale, I sold a larger amount on CB, like 100k, on the USDC/EUR pair which is rather low volume. 

Here‚Äôs how it went:

I put it up in a single sell wall, shadowing over the puny trades of the mere mortals. Every bid and ask before mine paled in comparison. There it stood, a monolith, looming over the market. 

As soon as the order hit the books my counterparties must‚Äôve recoiled in shock. Who was the nameless entity, willing to dump a vast fortune in a single breath? Whispers filled the market - has a whale arrived? Has Megalodon decided to feast?

At this point, time stood still. I have become death, maker of the markets. A force to be reckoned with, altering the fabric of the order book itself. 

Who would be brave enough to challenge my creation? 

Eventually, all monuments must fall, but the battle was one for the history books. At first only a few daring souls nibbled away at the edges of my fortress. But after the market overcame the initial shock, larger buyers emerged, each of their trades echoing like hammer strikes against the stone of my stronghold. 

It should not go down easy though, over the course of 6 long hours and 211 individual fills, they relentlessly dismantled my towering order, brick by brick. An epochal amount of time in the fast paced crypto realm. 

Finally, when the dust settled, and the sun rose, only rumors remained of what once stood tall. Another testimony to the patience of the market, able to move even the biggest mountains, with enough time.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade spots the theme in the EF Dev AMA questions and expresses caution</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f9ef5k/daily_general_discussion_september_5_2024/lllo8ra/)

[Most popular questions in the EF AMA right now](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/ama_we_are_ef_research_pt_12_05_september_2024/):

1. Value accrual thesis
2. Lowering blob fee?
3. Driving value to eth
4. Blob fee pricing

The community push for increasing blob fees has me a bit worried tbh, I still think this would be an extremely bad move. Not going into the details again today but 2 weeks ago [I detailed why I believe free blob fees + zero rollup congestion are fantastic combo for institutional adoption](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1exh5g5/comment/lj70pey/). One that's needed.

Then a couple of days later Sony announced the launch of an Ethereum rollup. Our first non crypto native rollup ever. Fantastic news. This confirmed what future Ethereum adoption will look like: companies with huge user bases will bring millions of users at once. Just like Base brings us 4 million weekly active addresses. Not gaining users one at a time. Millions at a time. Millions per institution, millions per rollup.

And then, a few days ago, Solana makes a 180¬∞ pivot from calling L2s parasitic and announces it now supports L2s. [Rebrands them "network extensions"](https://x.com/Austin_Federa/status/1830570709900493293).

**Please take a second to wonder: why would Solana pivot to L2s right now?**

At a moment when overall blockchain activity is moderate at best?

Could it be that Sony made them realize Ethereum is about to onboard one institution after the other? That the only way they'll compete is by faking their way into L2 adoption partnerships?

This is why the community push for blob fees worries me:

The only reason Solana got any traction to begin with is because Ethereum L1 fees were way too high in the past. That's what drove users to less decentralized lands.

Do we really want to make the same mistake again and offer an opportunity to Solana's L2s to gain any sort of traction? Not because we needed to but because we got greedy with our own few L2s?

Ethereum should do what a market leader does: grow the market as fast as possible and cash in when the whole world is in.

<summary>u/haurog introduces us to EVM Object Format or EOF</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f9ef5k/daily_general_discussion_september_5_2024/llleobx/)

For people wanting to know what EOF is and does, this is the most comprehensive discussion I have seen about it yet:

<https://xcancel.com/uttam_singhk/status/1830526179105001771>

or

<https://twitter.com/uttam_singhk/status/1830526179105001771>

It was shared by a Nethermind dev who works on EOF a few days ago, so I think it is technically accurate. It is a 30 minute video going through the why, the scope, the improvements, the changes and also addresses some of the criticism. It is definitely worth a watch as it gets pretty deep into the weeds, but he manages to explain it reasonably well. Some things were over my head, but I definitely learned a lot.

In short EOF helps to better store smart contract code on chain by adding a header and ordering code and date sections. Interestingly this even reduces codes size by a few %.  EOF does many validation checks during deployment instead of runtime, which can prevent some DOS attacks and might also help to increase the max size of smart contracts again (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-170.md). It also contains many smaller quality of life improvements for solidity developers. Some new calls are also introduced to interact with external contracts which improve efficiency.
Overall the EOF improvements are rather complex and the disadvantage is that the legacy contracts still need to be supported which increases complexity by duplicating some of the logic. This means it will take a lot of testing to make sure things work correctly.

All in all most people do not really need to change anything for this upgrade it will all be handled in the background. I think if you are a solidity dev you will have to learn a few more call functions but otherwise there is also not too much to do. I personally think EOF improvements are a very good step forward for the EVM.

I've been thinking about [these words](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fbq2nu/daily_general_discussion_september_8_2024/lm86prn/) from /u/BuyETHorDAI:

> The longer I'm in this space, the more I dislike tokens in general, but maybe I'm just jaded.

It causes me to wonder: What are the vital constructs of web3? It's hard to set aside price and market performance and just consider this question. Right now they seem to be coins, tokens, and NFTs, and everyone hates tokens and NFTs right now because they're salty about prices being down, but the question remains - ARE these the three fundamental constructs of web3? Are any of them truly irrelevant and going to die away? Are we missing more constructs?

I really don't know the answer, I'm just running it through my own mind. I could easily be convinced that they are the only fundamental constructs, or that we have too many or too few.

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

I think on-chain governance software is and will be indispensable. Code needs to be upgraded. How do we do that with so much at stake as safely as possible?

Otherwise I think tokens just represent digital ownership and are one of the best product fits blockchains have found. It's hard to hate on the concept of ownership, even if you may not like the distribution of ownership amongst all people. Changes of ownership often use what we consider financial tools which is basically all of Defi. That's not going away either.

I think we'll continue to see the proliferation of personal digital spaces. You were just talking about the base profile system yesterday. I mentioned layer3 a few weeks ago. Guild is another one. I think curating a digital identity is something most people understand from Facebook and will be better served when done on a system that isn't explicitly manipulating you with the data you give it.

The last thing I think will become vital on chain is peer to peer services. Payment will often be part of this so it will be intrinsically linked to the chain but you'll be able to pair yourself with someone willing to do something for you using the chain as a matchmaking service. This is pretty much all DePin and AVSs to start but I see little reason these systems couldn't be expanded to non-digital services eventually.

I can see ethereum impacting so many facets of life, but here are some that I would love to see personally:

Transaction settlement becomes faster and cheaper, with more assurances. I no longer wait 3-5 business days for something to clear. I‚Äôll have the stablecoins in my account and know that it‚Äôs there. Cross-border payments no longer take a big % fee and several days to finalize (as someone who has lived abroad but been paid in USD this was very frustrating).

Tokenize the world. Deeds. Royalties. IOUs. Licenses. Securities. Tickets. I see tokens as a hyper-efficient form of a wrapper, much like ETFs are for the financial world. 

Reduced communication and coordination friction. Especially when coordinating across time zones or governments. Ideally DAOs take form, but even without DAOs the ability to coordinate digitally worldwide with effective anti-Sybil features (via introducing costs or incentives) is amazing. Got a taste of it with ICOs before regulators shut that down, and fledgling communities around NFTs hint at what is possible. 

Decentralized exchanges. If we indeed tokenize the world, exchanges allow free market forces to find efficient solutions. In fact I was not sold on Ethereum until I looked into smart contracts, and when I realized what DEXs were capable of I became fully on board. But more than just shitcoin roulette, I want to see a future where one can trade currencies, assets, community access, etc., with more freedom and less cost than currently possible. 

There‚Äôs a lot more that I‚Äôm excited to see implemented, like personal privacy and public transparency, freedom of expression, the digital empires that are built now that digital ownership is enforceable. But that‚Äôs enough rambling from me already.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fe29xd/daily_general_discussion_september_11_2024/lmomzq4/)

I just [read](https://x.com/niftynaut/status/1833951284111802552) a VERY cool NFT (Punk) story on X. While you can click on the link and read the tweets, I have assembled them all here!

> üìú
> 
> Today happened one of the biggest crypto punk heists of all time. Someone with a lot of patience and knowledge **just bought ape 2386 for 10 ETH.**
> 
> Once upon a time when fractionalisation was en vogue, ape 2386 was fractionalised and valued at like 450 ETH. This happened on a now dysfunctional site called niftex. The ape stayed fractionalised even after they shut down as it was in an escrow contract. 10000 shares were all distributed between loads of people. And a buyout was not possible. Until now..
> 
> The contract worked in a way that if you propose a buyout, a 14 day grace period was initiated where the rest of the shareholders had time to ponder and accept or reject it. 14 days ago someone made a proposal for .001 eth per share. It was not rejected and went through.. Buying price: 10 ETH (last apes sold for 620 eth, 3.3k eth and 2.69k eth)
> 
> ü§Ø

[Tech Dive here!](https://x.com/0xQuit/status/1833981559910850603) (pasting it below)

> Punk 2386, with a current high bid of 600 eth, sold for 10 ETH today. A combination of clever sleuthing, followed by an unfortunate miscalculation lead to a 7 figure payday for 0x282.  
>   
> This ape punk was fractionalized into 10,000 ERC20 tokens on 9/26/2020, and spread out among what is now 257 holders.  
>  
> This was done on a now decommissioned platform called niftex (the contracts continue to live forever).The setup is such that any shareholder can propose a "shotgun", whereby any shareholder can propose a buyout price, and if nobody counters, they can purchase the asset after 14 days.0x282 initiated a shotgun on 8/28 (14 days ago).  
>   
> Some people took notice, including at least two shardholders. One put it off because they thought they had more time, but the other (@gmoneyNFT)  made an attempt to block.. In order to block the buyout, you must effectively purchase the proposer's shares at higher than their proposed price.  
>   
> 0x282 proposed a price of 0.001 eth per share (10 eth for all shares), so a valid counter needed to be 0.0010000001, as defined by the shotgun contract. gmoney submitted a counterclaim of 0.000001 ETH (1000000000000 wei), just short of the requirement.  
> At this point, if any other shareholder had contributed 10,000 wei (two TEN TRILLIONTHS of a cent) to the counterclaim, the shotgun would have been blocked. But two ten trillionths of a cent was not committed, the shotgun was not blocked, and 0x282 walks away with the steal of the century: 1 of only 24 ape punks, for 70% under the global punk floor.

***Tough pills to swallow***

Throwing shade and vitriol at TA people won't make the ratio any better.

------------------------

I personally (not speaking for the mod team) would like to see less hate for certain users or types of posts. When JT and the other OG mods founded this subreddit they did a stellar job in fostering a positive and welcoming community, even in the darkest of times price wise. I would like to encourage people not to take out their frustrations on others. I get it, you don't think TA means anything and you're probably right, but that doesn't justify vilifying people posting TA here or a YouTuber who has been calling for the ratio to "come home" back to 0.03 or 0.04.

I wouldn't even say I'm siding with the TA folks here, in fact I've expressed not being super approving of some TA and also bashing on the semi-predatory paid private group model which folks like Ben Cowen use which has simply never sat right with me (but to be fair, it is better than shilling bybit leverage affiliate links etc). Anyway, I feel caught in the middle. I don't really side with anyone but I'm sick of the negativity of people picking on certain names and types of content. One side of this debate is constantly being angry and bashing people while the other just stays quiet and often times leaves altogether and that's not right. This is a subreddit which is welcome to all. So can we please just chill out a bit and keep it a bit more wholesome?

It's always personal attacks and bold claims about TA working or not working and never any evidence to back it up. Baseless rants just spread negativity and makes this place a lot less welcoming which is against the subreddit's ethos. If you must go on a crusade against TA, at least find some peer reviewed papers which prove that it is bullshit or something because I'm yet to see anyone do anything like that when talking about this topic and I say that as someone who is very much a TA skeptic. At the very least one could go back and review all the TA posts here and sum up how many of them were right/wrong and use that as evidence (albeit low-quality evidence).

<summary>u/CaptainLoud decided to build a cool little app</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f3uche/daily_general_discussion_august_29_2024/lkhqgln/)

**Introducing** [https://boasty.app/](https://boasty.app/) **- Schedule Your Ethereum Posts**

Dear ethfinance, special day for me today - after 7 years in the space, i get to show something small i built. Inspired by this u/benido2030 [post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ez4fxr/daily_general_discussion_august_23_2024/ljigy38/) last Saturday, i spent the last 5 days building Boasty. I always wanted to try building an app on Ethereum, and this idea sounded simple enough so i gave it a go and now it's live.

**TLDR Pay 1 USD in stablecoin and schedule a post on Ethereum, you get a https://boasty.app permalink to reference and share which contains your published message and transactions associated.** See an example [here](https://www.boasty.app/QTq8MoMKLV)

The app is an MVP but everything works as far as i can tell. It is currently permissioned, meaning the messages are stored in a centralized database and no smart contracts yet, but as you can see on the [roadmap](https://www.boasty.app/roadmap), I intend to introduce message storing on IPFS, smart contract(s), sha256 hashed messages with auto or user reveal, supporting more wallets (currently only tested with Metamask), L2 networks and hopefully more.

Last but not least, I'd like to make the app free to post for my fellow solo stakers and the /r/ethfinance community (EVM holders for now?). Happy to hear any ideas on how to make this happen!

Feedback appreciated, feel free to say it like it is and try to break the app. I am not on crypto twitter or any of those, so if you like it, please share it! Thanks u/benido2030 for the idea!

**Hi, what do you go by and what's your EVMavericks #?**

*Hey, this is [Etheraider](https://reddit.com/user/etheraider) and [I‚Äôm EVM 1209.](https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F00468a8cc121dbeffd734d3f50dadb56.png&w=1200&q=75)*

**Who or what introduced you to crypto?**

*My brother bought into ETH in 2015, held for 2 years, and sold right before the 2017 bull run. I didn‚Äôt know anything about crypto until I saw he missed out on life-changing gains, so I decided to learn from his mistake!*

**How and when did you find your way into EVMs?**

*Well, actually, I was there at the very beginning and helped bring EVMavericks to the blockchain!*

**So it's been a couple of years since the beginning; what made you stay?**

*I think we're one of the best communities of OGs on Ethereum‚Äîa lot of good people around with all sorts of talent, perspective, and experience in the space. It‚Äôs a good place to be.*

**What's your best EVMavericks memory?**

*There are a lot of good ones. But I‚Äôd say that first EVM podcast we launched, where many of us (who knew each other only on Reddit for years) ‚Äútalked‚Äù together for the first time. It was awesome.*

**What are you most excited about EVMs looking forward?**

*In the short term, I‚Äôm looking forward to us getting into the Octant funding round. In the long term, I‚Äôm excited to see future endeavors our community members will pursue!*

**What is your favorite hobby or way to spend time outside of crypto?**

*Well, this past year, I got really into going to the gym and living a healthier lifestyle. Decided to place an emphasis on taking care of my mind, body, and soul! As far as hobbies go, I‚Äôm a big fan of disc golf, tabletop board games, and ping pong!*

**What one piece of advice would you give to someone who's just getting into crypto?**

*Learn about why crypto exists, how powerful its impact can be, and how it can dramatically change all our lives for the better.*

**Any piece of alpha that you can share with us? It can be anything, not just crypto-related.**

*When you‚Äôre on your deathbed, are you gonna care about how much money you‚Äôve made or how nice your house/cars/etc. are? No. The only thing you‚Äôll care about is the people you love and the impact you‚Äôve had on them. Don‚Äôt wait until then to go all in on the people you love.*

**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share? Maybe a project you are working on? Latest accomplishments? Whatever you want! The stage is yours Etheraider!**

<summary>u/JebediahKholin highlights 3 issues for ETH this year</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f4n4q0/daily_general_discussion_august_30_2024/lkp52q3/)

It seems like ETH has 3 big problems this year.
  
1) Airdrop flop - the hype for eigenlayer and others was completely unreal, while the airdrops themselves were a terrible combination of stingy and overpriced. If a token launches at its best possible market cap, there's nowhere to go but down, especially if there are gigantic unlocks coming. Tokens were a lot more interesting when you had a real chance at making a killing at buying something that seemed like it had real fundamentals or promise. If some hyper-complicated protocol launches at an insane valuation, there are going to be very few buyers - it's too complicated for non-crypto natives, the upside is already priced in, and people are going to want to unload the tokens. So every new token has pretty much gotten crushed. tough way to build market hype.
  
2) ETF Flop - The BTC ETF set up some incredible expectations, but ETH matching it was always going to be an issue. BTC got huge early inflows from crypto-natives wanting to offload some of their unchain coins so they don't have to worry about custody. It makes a lot of sense from a diversification perspective, and there's basically nothing to do with unchain bitcoin, anyway. Institutions/financial advisors are much more slow moving, but the retail buyers disguised this. This was huge for bitcoins narrative and expanded its presence among the broader world. ETH, by contrast, will only be bought in the ETF by those who really can't interact with onchain infrastructure - basically, financial advisors, institutions, 401ks, which all take a long time to spin up. Holding ETH onchain is valuable, so there's a real cost to using the ETF instead. This makes sense to us, but makes ETH look bad to the tradfi world/retail, furthering the narrative that there's bitcoin as the main crypto, and then there's everything else. While this is disputed by the fundamentals, the fundamentals are complicated. Narrative is tough.
  
3) Solana meme coins - memecoins on Solana have been a retail incinerator. They look appealing - zero transaction fees that let you avoid extractive vc coins - but the reality is that Solana's centralized validator, sequencer, and MEV setup allows for colossal extraction, while the meme coins themselves allow for easily faked volume metrics and huge insider dumping. It's hard to imagine a worse market to participate in. However, the notable crypto influencers are some of the only people making money off this, so they pound the table about how great Solana is. VCs are (and have always been) huge owners of Solana, so they. ALSO pound the table on how great sol is/how bad etc is. So Solana is stealing retail mindshare while impoverishing everyone who uses the chain. It's a bad outcome.

So what does ETH need to re-attract retail? Yield farming and gambling. Onchain options that are actually liquid. New tokens launching quickly (as a quasi ico while avoiding being direct icos) at low valuations so that some momentum can build. Tokens that actually result in cash flow when staked, so that people have an actual reason to buy/speculate on them. 

What ETH REALLY needs is to capture mindshare from bitcoin as a pristine non-sovereign store of value. ETH should be fighting with bitcoin and gold, not with Solana. Solana as a network may be great (I don't think it is but ignore that for now) but SOL the token is complete garbage unless things change dramatically.

<summary>u/HSuke recaps Vitalik's impromptu AMA</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f5fiqc/daily_general_discussion_august_31_2024/lkus89q/)

**Vitalik Buterin started an unofficial AMA last weekend on Warpcast** after he posted about [stablecoin decentralization on X](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1827583576751181961)

TL;DR of the original X post:

* **DEX**: great
* **Decentralized Stablecoins**: great
* **Polymarket**: great
* **Semi-decentralized Stablecoin like USDC**: Not great, but they're a practical and convenient necessity. The issuer is centralized, but the rest of on-chain use is decentralized
* Anything that has **no sustainability** like "decentralized" liquidity farming or yield farming: Very bad. The key reason is lack of sustainability. These are just get-rich schemes.
* It's not enough to only have finance on blockchains. It needs more real applications outside of finance
* Useful related post: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html

---------------------------

These are the highlights from the Warpcast AMA response to that X post:

I've paraphrased the important parts of some of the longer questions and responses

* **Q**: Banana Milk or Chocolate Milk?
* **Vit**: Coconut milk is best, almond if I can't find coconut. I don't drink either independently, I put it into stuff, and that stuff in question ends up containing bananas and dark chocolate at roughly equal frequencies (usually both)

----

* **Q**: Do you have any heuristic for when compromises to decentralized principles go too far for stablecoins?
* **Vit**: My main worry is when they start entrenching network effects that become hard to undo. For example, if we start normalizing "sign in to this crypto social thing with Google", I think that's really bad, UNLESS it's done in an account-abstraction way where under the hood it's using zk-email and individual users can sign in with their ethereum account instead (and convert their account from one to the other). This way, it's not entrenching network effects of centralized web2 platforms, it's actually creating a bridge that lets users join the ecosystem with them, but then more easily migrate away from them.

----

* **Q**: Last TV series you watched? And if you liked it
* **Vit**: "Three Body Problem" was good
* **My opinion**: Hell yeah! Lots of Ethereum devs are "Dark Forest" fans due to its parallels with Ethereum MEV. Personally, I would recommend the Netflix adoption over the gigantic Chinese soap opera one, but neither series has reached the "Dark Forest" book yet.

----

* **Q**: Do you prefer ¬∞C to ¬∞F?
* **Vit**: I prefer C, but it's a weaker preference than all the other units. I would gladly take a trade of switching to F in exchange for never hearing about either feet/miles or ounces/pounds again.

----

* **Q**: How can we offer decentralized access to content? Http is not good enough any more. Ipfs feels unusable when it comes to normal users (without http gateways). Thoughts?
* **Vit**: We need browsers with IPFS integrated. Brave was supposed to be that, but unfortunately its IPFS gateway is quite slow so I never end up using it.
* **My opinion**: Agreed. I hate how difficult and slow it is to access IPFS gateways via browser extensions. IPFS is barely accessible unless you pay for premium gateway services.

----

* **Q**: [Pure decentralization is overrated] Farcaster, Base, and Telegram have a decentralized foundation, but were built by centralized teams.
* **Vit**: If the team behind Farcaster didn't build and market Warpcast, we wouldn't be here now. The use cases we want Ethereum to take on need the centralized approach to grow, but are placed on a decentralized foundation.
* **My opinion**: Agreed. Almost nothing we do in crypto is purely decentralized, and that would be an unrealistic expectation. We would never be able trust anything on-chain without prior off-chain trust for the teams that build those protocols. That is, unless user were a senior crypto developer with code-auditing expertise, which is ridiculous requirement.

----

* **Q**: Do you see usdc overtaking cashapp, apple pay and the likes as a generally acceptable form of payment
* **Vit**: I think we need to have easy to use ethereum-ecosystem-wide L2 payments first for that to happen.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f5fiqc/daily_general_discussion_august_31_2024/lkxs0gz/)

There has been a lot of posts of people feeling down recently. My honest response to this is stop looking at numbers and make something for the fun of it. If you can code write contracts that do something fun. If you can design then make mockups for weird fictional games. If you can write, publish an article about a future society where eth never existed. Start playing with apps. use things. break things. find the glitches, the edges. look in the mirror. uniswap backwards is pawsinu. What if the aave ghost is haunting the chain? How many times have people sent exactly 0.666 eth? What if we start calling them nifties again instead of nft? can we make bingo on base? 

there is so much for us to do. now it is september. summer lull is over. what is dead may never die üêô

At the same time [transaction count is near ATH and active addresses maintained pretty well throughout the summer](https://www.growthepie.xyz/). The main reason why blobs seem to go down is thanks to optimizations by L2s. 

Showing the market that Ethereum has room to grow is absolutely needed, [if we were near saturation today we wouldn't have institutional rollups tomorrow](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1exh5g5/comment/lj70pey/).

<summary>u/cryptrd285 doesn't see much space for competition</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f66n0f/daily_general_discussion_september_1_2024/ll2qd0o/)

This is like a vampire attack we used to see during 2020 - 2021 defi time frame. I kind of like this thought process 

<https://x.com/CloutedMind/status/1830405365898580245>

i take the stance that blobs being 0 fee is bullish

it chokes competition

DA is ultimately a race to 0 anyway, might as well weaponize DA as loss leader to expand ethereum GDP

not only does it tell all these DA layoors to go fk themselves like TIA etc, it chokes any ethereum L2 competitors

no longer can an alt-L1 use "cheaper" as a selling point, only "faster" and "more decentralized" (than an L2)

i think soon we see L2s that be "faster" like megaETH and then we get 2/3

then as the roadmap for L2s go along and they become more permissionless without centralization risks we tick 3/3 (cheaper, faster and more decentralized with the inherent security of eth)

then where does an alt-l1 compete ? it doesnt.. its just L2 vs L2 and its all on ethereum

and ETH is their money

thats moat

<summary>u/Kallukoras dodged a bullet and starts a conversation about risk</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f8l3t3/daily_general_discussion_september_4_2024/llgh79n/)

Yesterday night I was devastated, I have a big part of my funds in Penpie a yield aggregator for pendle and it was exploited yesterday evening. 

I saw an an alert on twitter and was hoping I would be not affected. But the asset rsweth that was my main holding in one of their LPs was part of it. I had the worst night. 

I found out today that only one of the two rsweth pools was exploited, the bigger one with higher tvl and apy, the smaller one that also gets swell L2 points(the reason I was in it) but less yield  was not drained and I was spared by pure luck, I guess the attacker focussed on the higher TVL Pools. I should be okay when withdrawals open again. I can still be part of ethfinance and all the crazy ups and downs.

I don‚Äôt want to experience that again, is there a safe way to get some yield at least? Or should I just stick by pure ETH on a ledger secured cold wallet? Or maybe rETH? 

Losing your funds like this would be the worst, it is worse then (controlled)leverage trading and shitcoin trading because everything could be gone without an error of your own , besides trusting a protocol you should not have trusted.

One small advantage I gained of that experience is I really don‚Äôt worry about the short term price action, I know we will be rewarded if we are patient and  ETH will come back and we will reach new ATHs at some point.

<summary>u/defewit also discusses risk taken on for a yield, but this time compares centralised vs decentralised yield</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f8l3t3/daily_general_discussion_september_4_2024/llgvbe0/)

Posting as a top level comment a reply I was drafting to a deleted comment regarding onchain vs. tradfi "yield farming".

No doubt a large portion of "yield farming" is circular nonsense. BUT, even in the world of circular nonsense, *the onchain version is transparent with respect to its risk profile* and that is a consequential distinction vs. things like FTX/Celcius.

As an example, if Bernie Madoff launched a classic shitcoin yield farm with copies of battletested smart contracts, participants can trust the contracts without having to trust the person.

On the other hand, if the Pope himself started a centralized "yield farm" where I have to send him money via Western Union, the risk profile is now comparatively opaque and a million different risks must be weighed, no offense to His Holiness.

---

Ponzinomics aside, it's worth highlighting that more sustainable sources of yield *do* exist on Ethereum, think of AMM liquidity providing for example. It's making money from market making, totally normal financial service, but onchain and therefore transparent/permissionless/non-custodial/always online :)

Of course, the question of which tokens are being traded and how many have sustainable value is important for the long term viability of the ecosystem. It's a complicated question. The Ethereum economy has a lot of bullshit (just like the "regular" economy), but I think it has already "made it", there's already real activity in payments, savings, tokenization of treasuries/corporate debt, collectibles, etc.

<summary>u/nagus 's Ethereum thesis has remained and strengthened since 2016</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ez4fxr/daily_general_discussion_august_23_2024/ljnmoik/)

1. Conviction.  Ethereum thesis from 2016 is unchanged; still the most decentralized blockchain, most trusted, energy efficient, second-most lindy, and the core developers have an excellent war chest even 9 years onwards as everyone here has noted today.  Also, for anyone who thinks Ethereum is too big or too boring to make great risk-adjusted returns - remember that Ethereum was the second-largest market cap cryptocurrency when it was trading at $6 in Dec 2016.
2. ETF flows are only just about to get started with major RIAs allowed to begin allocating in the coming months - only the very most sophisticated self-directed individual investors have begun allocating in US retirement accounts.
3. Market liquidity from rate cuts and dxy tailwinds incoming - send it.
4. Regulatory environment outlook in the world's largest economy is looking better than it has ever been.
5. Stablecoins remain the near-term killer app and the Ethereum ecosystem is still poised to capture most of this; the world's smallest economies are adopting first on the lowest-cost blockchain solutions but the largest economies will adopt last and they will choose Ethereum-based infrastructure for a stronger security guarantee due to the larger economic risk.
6. Medium-term the continued rise of AI applications will provide more tailwinds for crypto as automated financial agents leverage the machine-friendly interfaces of blockchains for banking and transactions.

This is a much easier investment thesis to make than it was in 2016 and consequently is the reason I've remained close to fully invested since then.

The short-term frenzy of memecoins and L1-of-the-year technologies will continue to be eclipsed in the long-term by the secular growth of cryptocurrencies with incredible value accruing to the leaders in the space.  The risk/reward profile of Ethereum is better than it has ever been..

Am I talking my book?  Hell yeah I am.

At it again today to fight misinformation in r/cc 

Anytime Ethereum is mentioned there will be someone to say it's not decentralized. I'd say half of them believe it, and many of the people who read them will believe them.

I wish Ethereum had armies of people fighting disinformation like other projects have armies to create it. But it's a frustrating way of spending time.

<summary>u/eth2353 shares some exciting new validator client news</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f29003/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2024/lk523rf/)

Today's finally the day I get to share something with you I've been working on for some time - a new validator client targeting Ethereum. It's biggest advantage is it allows you to use and combine the data from multiple beacon nodes. This allows us to use multiple client implementations at Serenita, combining their output and results in us being completely protected against single-client bugs! My hope is other operators adopt this too, resulting in a more client-diverse and resilient Ethereum.

I made an introductory tweet [here](https://x.com/SerenitaIO/status/1828329758851236232) , I would appreciate any likes/retweets since our Twitter presence is not that huge yet.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f29003/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2024/lk6hqhi/)

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

Makerdao rebrands as sky. The protocol is now sky protocol. You can swap MKR to SKY tokens, but you can keep your MKR if you want.

A new stablecoin called USDS is created it can be swapped from/to DAI 1:1. Not sure how long this is possible. DAI can still be used. The protocol gets officially launched on September 18.

USDS seems to have built in SKY rewards. SKY tokens will be distributed to USDS holders/protocol users.

More info on: <https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959>

Really curious how this relaunch will turn out in the coming years.

EDIT: As announced, the new USDS has a freeze function which makes it similar to USDC adn USDT: <https://xcancel.com/functi0nZer0/status/1828432650152935605>

[u/Stobie](https://reddit.com/u/Stobie):

Seems strong negative initial reaction to makerdao and dai upcoming upgrade, largely because it has a "freeze function". AFAICT from [https://github.com/makerdao/usds/blob/dev/src/Usds.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/usds/blob/dev/src/Usds.sol) there's no explicit freeze function for now, the issue is it's upgradeable which is equivalent to having a freeze function. I think to be fair to sky people should acknowledge basically everyone has exposure to upgradeable protocols already, including the major stablecoins. It was inevitable if the goal is to work with RWAs with sufficient compliance, should be no surprise.

Practically we can't avoid mutability exposure (use immut. silo and USDC or chainlink multisigs can still get you), key is how it's done. Is it a multisig that might be one guy with no time delay? Or is it a token vote which is very slow / is multisig behind a timelock? Seems likely in this case auth is DAO which is too transparent and slow to freeze anything, user can move before DAO adds them to pause map.

I think sky and usds will have their place, excited to see how it goes. But more so for "pure dai", we lost NM but he still talked to Rune about these things a little, maybe they can come up with something which meaningfully improves on RAI.

<summary>u/Detroitlions81 reflects on the Ethereum experience</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f29003/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2024/lkaaqjs/)

Something I miss from the bear market of ~2018-2020 are the inside jokes and the dark humor to get us through the rough times. EZPZ $324 that one rhino account mocking us as we slid further, the hodl messages. I look back at that time weirdly well. I guess I was so self assured that we were misunderstood or not understood at all.

The last bull run we were learning about maker, compound, uniswap, aave, yearn finance and it was this adventure to try all them out and exciting to try a whole new world without filling out forms, showing your identity or waiting on someone‚Äôs approval. It was fun to be an explorer and then it got even better because we got airdrops out of it. And from there it turned into something else where we turned into airdrop hunters. I didn‚Äôt feel incentives to try out something unless it had airdrop potential. Other protocols started getting hacked and it felt even worse to try things that weren‚Äôt battle tested. Our tolerance to take risks and explore was diminished by the two prong attack of protocol hacks and airdrop expectations.

All of this compounded with the idea that none of the l2 experience feels like the OG experience of eth. Trying to explain to outsiders how you found a new protocol to try out on scroll becomes an absolute chore. I.E purchase some eth on Coinbase, purchase a hardware wallet, send eth to your wallet, bridge to scroll, and from there trust that this protocol doesn‚Äôt have an exploit that loses your funds. 

Like yeah maybe it‚Äôs not all that difficult to figure out if you put in the effort. You take the time and learn. The logic is sound if you find the right places or people to guide you. But it‚Äôs too much to expect people that don‚Äôt share the passion to get into. 

I‚Äôm optimistic it‚Äôll get better truly. But to get to that next level I think a lot of these L2‚Äôs need to consolidate. OP or Zksync or Arbitrum need to feel just like Ethereum or build their own brand to Ethereum‚Äôs level. 

Thanks for reading. There just aren‚Äôt people I see in the world that understand or care about Ethereum.

<summary>u/pa7x1 speculates on future blob demand</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1f31zal/daily_general_discussion_august_28_2024/lkbmqp8/)

Three filled blobs are worth around 500 USD for ETH price in burn from blobspace alone. We are close to filling it up not even 6 months onto the upgrade. Ethereum's usage has grown up 700% in one year from 50-60 tps to 350-400 tps and is not showing signs of stopping here. 

Why I'm saying this... 3 years ago nobody had a fucking clue how to value Ethereum. So I wrote a little article explaining how you can value the network based on fee revenues, how to calculate a DCF, how the burn places a floor on Ethereum's long-term price, how you can view the burn as having an equivalent effect to the price as a buyback... 3 years later this understanding has penetrated deeper and now you have CT "analysts" calling ETH dead because they don't understand EIP-1559 fee mechanism and how it creates a fee market. And they are using the same arguments that were laid out on this subreddit first to price Ethereum, against it. 

They still have no fucking clue. Ethereum is gonna fill those blobs, and then we are gonna release more blobs and they will get filled again. And every factor of 3 is gonna bring another 500 USD in price to Ethereum through burn. And in a decade you will have something like 64 blobs and that's gonna bring you 10K USD/ETH just from blobspace. Not even taking into account L1 native blockspace. And not taking into account any monetary premium that will slowly form because ETH will become the most pristine collateral of all that economy flowing on top and has way lower issuance than USD and even Bitcoin. 


Here are the numbers...

`500 tps x (60 x 60 x 24) secs/day x 0.05 USD/tx x 50% (L1 value capture) / 2500 ETH/day`

There are 3 assumptions here, so I let you decide their uncertainty.

500 tps with 3 blobs: Based on estimates of current tps and blobs filled. Blobs could get denser with compression improvements. But likely not an order of magnitude denser.

0.05 USD average L2 fee: This should land the median fee in around 1-2 cents that is low even for very low added value transactions like buying a coffee. Therefore at those fees even the lowest added value transactions are feasible onchain. This is also close to Solana average fees, so at those fees you can outcompete the promise of cheap fees of alt L1s.

50% value capture: the hardest to estimate. I suspect it will be a tad higher eventually, 70ish%. But assuming 50% has the advantage of not being too far wrong in either direction. If L1 only captures 25% of value (which I consider very low) we are wrong by a factor of 2. If L1 captures almost all value we are wrong by a factor of 2. So I'm splitting the bill here. 

2500 ETH/day is just how many we issue nowadays. This is quite bounded from above given Ethereum's issuance formula.

<summary>u/superphiz shares the Guardians of the Ether upgradable NFTfor solo and home stakers</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ez4fxr/daily_general_discussion_august_23_2024/ljjmocf/)

This has been a LONG time coming, but /u/jtnichol, /u/nixorokish, and /u/logic_beach, and I met with Leo Glisic and Kyndle, founders of [Guardians of the Ether](https://www.etherguardians.xyz/) to share their project publicly.

Guardians of the Ether is an upgradable NFT for solo & home stakers that serves as a badge that can promote inclusion of stakers in governance.

These NFTs are non-transferrable, so there is no economic incentive to claim this NFT - only bragging rights. (Think twenty years from now!)

Every year, a few weeks after September 15, these badges can be upgraded to show another year of beacon chain participation.

With gas in the low single-digits, now is an excellent time to mint yours.

[Here's the video launch describing the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvFyIvgKmso).

You can also see the project on [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/guardians-of-the-ether).

<summary>u/eth2353 has the latest on Ethereum consensus timing games</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1esmtac/daily_general_discussion_august_15_2024/li7xbe2/)

If you're a home staker and were wondering why you're missing more head votes than a few years ago, at least part of the blame seems to be on Kiln, one of the largest Ethereum staking node operators.

Toni Wahrst√§tter (EF) published a new article yesterday:

> On Attestations, Block Propagation, and Timing Games

Kiln seems to have been pushing "timing games" to the very limit, "delaying block proposals to the 3-3.5 second mark within the slot." Blocks are supposed to be published 0 seconds into the slot. Publishing 1-1.5 seconds into the slot is still considered okay for various reasons but 3-3.5 seconds is really pushing it since the attestation deadline is at 4 seconds into the slot. Before that deadline, the block needs to be propagated globally over the P2P network, and fully processed by nodes. That gets quite difficult (read: impossible) when the block is proposed 3.5 seconds into the slot.

Some other quotes from the article, I tried not taking them out of context but still would recommend reading the full article:

> This chart shows the evolution of timing games. We can see that blocks from Kiln validators appear later and later over time.
> 
> the longer one waits, the higher the expected number of missed head votes
> 
> This comes with an impact on the network: for blocks proposed by Kiln proposers, the missed/wrong head vote rate is significantly higher:
> 
> Kiln shows outlier behavior. While most node operators‚Äô attesters correctly vote for the parent block rather than the local block, Kiln‚Äôs attesters appear to disregard this norm. Over 10% of Kiln attesters attempt to keep the local block on-chain by voting for it. If such strategies are adopted, they might justify the losses from incorrect head votes if they prevent the local block from being reorged. However, these tactics are generally frowned upon within the Ethereum community: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play with consensus‚Äù.

[Full post on ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-attestations-block-propagation-and-timing-games/20272)

[Tweet](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1823710182628602264)

So, are we ready to call Kiln a bad actor here? I myself am not quite there yet but I do think they're already way too big of an actor regardless of these timing games, managing almost 5% of all Ethereum validators ([rated.network](https://explorer.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=nodeOperator&timeWindow=1d&page=1&pageSize=15), may be even higher). I strongly dislike this behavior though, that's why I'm sharing it here with all of you.

I do like a few things that Kiln does, like their in-depth blog posts about client diversity ([1](https://www.kiln.fi/post/ethereum-client-diversity-part-1-consensus-finalization), [2](https://www.kiln.fi/post/ethereum-client-diversity-part-2-execution-layer-diversity), [3](https://www.kiln.fi/post/ethereum-client-diversity-part-3-consensus-layer-diversity)) and their [open-source validator monitoring solution](https://github.com/kilnfi/eth-validator-watcher) that we also use at Serenita.

Still I can't help but think playing these timing games causes unnecessary stress to the network, only resulting in short-term profits.

( For those that don't know the full context - these timing games are played in order to extract a bit more MEV. So as a validator you basically make a selfish decision to make a little bit more profit that hurts the rest of the network because they get a lower reward for the wrong head vote. )

Be wary when joining crypto projects from unknown people.

A notable Moon/Donut farmer was a victim of a spear phishing social engineering attack: <https://x.com/ZoomerXBT/status/1823438152394055994>

The attacker convinced the victim to check out the project to see if the victim would be interested in joining the team to create NFTs for it. The executable for the supposed game project turned out to be a Remote Access Tool.

<summary>u/Dreth educates us on wallet security</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1etgdqq/daily_general_discussion_august_16_2024/lidnkcl/)

I was going to reply to this in the chain of comments of the case of that moon/donut farmer (which /u/HSuke posted) that was targetted and drained but I will make this as a top level comment for more visibility:

Windows itself is a riskier system to use and was mentioned as an attack vector in the thread, however, it's also fair to say that there are several red flags here from the info i get from this chain of comments and it's that:

- Never use hot wallets for any significant amounts of money
- Never run unknown software (this can happen on any system)
- Be skeptical of crypto jobs which are a significant vector of attack for scammers (esp. gaming, moderator, or unspecified soft-skill based jobs)
- Be skeptical of anything passed to you through telegram, as telegram despite being an excellent piece of software also makes it extremely easy to wipe the chat likely doesn't pursue scams beyond simple bans 
- If you absolutely need to open software or a document, use a virtual machine, this person ran that binary no condom in his machine
- Gaming projects are especially prone to be represented by scammers as they often require installing software, so this should immediately be a red flag
- Treat random messages as scams outright, in any platform, from anyone, making sure to take extra care and question absolutely every single thing the person tells you, often assuming it's false and with intent to scam you. Especially if your wallets are out in the open and public or you're a well known farmer/social media person/community manager or member/have a valuable doxxed wallet or if your email or personal details have been in any data breach.

For data breach related things I suggest checking https://haveibeenpwned.com which has several tools to check this which are well known in the privacy community. Also consider using tools and taking measures recommended by https://privacyguides.org.

I also wrote an [article](https://dac.ac/blog/improving_your_privacy_security) about this on my website which I posted on here a while ago. I've learned a lot about networking and other things since I wrote this, so some things might be slightly off, but if you wanna check it out feel free. 

More importantly though, I highly recommend _software isolation_, which is the most important measure to take. Minimize your surface area for attack:

- Run unknown and potentially risky-to-use software in virtual machines
- Isolate your crypto activity to a different _CLEAN_ browser (only with your wallet software) or a different clean machine altogether
- Avoid using hot wallets as much as you can

For more technical folk and programmers in this community, or those interested: You should also learn to use smart contract testing software like brownie (python), foundry (rust) or hardhat (javascript) to automate transactions and use hot wallets in a programmatic way, though when learning to use these always use testnets first to try. Learning to use software like this and learning smart contract programming languages like solidity, vyper or others will absolutely help you in navigating the space in a much more careful way.

<summary>u/HauntedJockStrap88 is convinced that ETH's fundamental advantages will play out in time</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1etgdqq/daily_general_discussion_august_16_2024/lienfys/)

Besides ‚Äúeveryone and god hates us‚Äù, I‚Äôve yet to see a good reason why the fundamental advantages of ETH won‚Äôt play out in price over the next 12-18 months. 

ETH is the only smart contract platform that has the institutional/regulatory green light. 

ETH is inflating minimally/deflating forever since the merge and 4844. (Compare ETH vs SOL) 

ETH is the only smart contract platform that has a record of liveness that is acceptable for global settlement. (Again compare to SOL outages) 

L2 scaling is a wild success and is up only. L2 usage is up only. 

If smartcontracts/blockchain is a transformative technology there is no real competitor to ETH. BTC DOESN‚ÄôT DO ANYTHING. Sure, it might be a good investment since enough people think it‚Äôs neat, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs in competition with ETH. 

The ONLY reason I see ETH failing is if blockchain itself is rendered useless by some other unforeseen technology. But otherwise the instantaneous settlement, immutability, and resilience of a decentralized smart contract platform like ETH offers enough advantages over the legacy system that it can‚Äôt *not* be adopted. And if a decentralized smart contract platform is adopted it will be ETH. 

Regulatory clarity in the US is coming. 
Continued scalability increases are coming. 
Widespread stablecoin payments are coming. 
Institutional adoption has started. 
DEFI use will be up only. 

People are worried over 5 months of bad PA for ETH the asset and I agree it has sucked but narrative follows price- don‚Äôt let the bad PA make you think the ETH fundamentals have changed.

This has been mentioned yesterday, i think the ezpz etf might be very interesting for european users. An etf holding only one asset is prohibited in europe/eu as far as i know, thats why the current etfs are not available to buy.

Maybe someone more knowledgeable can elaborate further, but afaik you need a basket of assets to get an etf approved in europe. Lets hope the minimum is 2!

<summary>u/MerkleChainsaw brainstorms a possible way to fight MEV and u/cryptOwOcurrency builds off this by drawing parallels to email</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1evtl8k/daily_general_discussion_august_19_2024/liwdb4d/)

[u/MerkleChainsaw](https://reddit.com/u/MerkleChainsaw):

Would it be possible to defeat MEV with no protocol changes with smarter wallets?

1. Validators could choose to flag that they will avoid MEV and randomize transaction order in their block.
2. Their adherence could be observed by third parties and wallet providers to create a list of validators using and not using MEV.
3. Because proposers are known ahead of time, wallets could give users a toggle to transact either on "first available block" or "wait for first available MEV free block". Getting a MEV free validator wouldn't be guaranteed but could be targeted.
4. Assuming a critical mass of validators goes "MEV free" and enough users toggle to attempt MEV free transactions they could see a higher share of fee revenue to make up for lost MEV.

Besides the chicken-and-egg problem here, a problem I see with this idea is that if the "MEV free" validators captured a larger share of DeFi transaction fees this could be offset by regular validators getting a larger share of simple token transactions since their blocks would otherwise be emptier. Also for any really big MEV opportunities it would be worth it for any validator to just take the MEV, exit the pool, and re-enter with a new identity. If we could find solutions to these problems, it feels a lot cleaner to me than some of the currently proposed solutions like builder separation.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

To me this feels like the email reputation problem all over again.

In the early days of the internet, anybody's computer could directly send an email to an email server and it would get delivered. Then as email became widespread, the concept of spam email arose.

So email service providers (ESPs) started tracking reputation by IP address, which is what they do to this day. Each ESP keeps a small rotation of "clean" IP addresses to send mail from, and they work hard to make sure nobody uses them to send spam so that their IP reputation stays clean. And each ESP keeps a list of blocklists that contain tons of low-reputation IPs, from which they auto delete all incoming emails.

The result is a system where yes, technically speaking you can send an email directly, but it's largely impossible from a residential internet connection since they block the outgoing port (SMTP) to prevent spam, and it's largely impossible from a web host or VPS too because chances are that whatever IP you get, someone else has already sent spam and ruined its email reputation (if the web host doesn't outright block the SMTP port). So it's a technically open system where the only way you can send an email in practice is to hand your email off to an ESP like Gmail or Yahoo or iCloud or specialized "email hosting" products for delivery.

Trust me, email servers suck balls to maintain. It's a lot of writing blocklist maintainers to try to get off their lists - maintainers who only expect emails from email hosting companies. And the software is far less streamlined than web hosting software, since nobody hosts email servers anymore. It's a full time job.

All that is to say, if there's one or more independent parties certifying whether validators are MEV-free, the endgame is that it turns into another whack-a-mole reputation management scheme just like email. And I don't want running a validator to suck balls like running an email server does.

> Also for any really big MEV opportunities it would be worth it for any validator to just take the MEV, exit the pool, and re-enter with a new identity. If we could find solutions to these problems, it feels a lot cleaner to me than some of the currently proposed solutions like builder separation.

You have to track reputation *somehow*. And there are limited ways of doing so. You could track them by IP, which runs into the aforementioned issues and makes "clean" IP addresses expensive. Or you could track the coins themselves, which just means that every ETH on chain has a hidden reputation value, which makes "clean" ETH more expensive.

I believe the answer is "it fundamentally cannot be done in a fair way within the latest production version of the Ethereum protocol".

Edit: Of course, protocol changes like shutterization can help.

<summary>u/haurog educates us on staking with RISC-V chip architecture</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ewn8dw/daily_general_discussion_august_20_2024/lj2anr4/)

Warning, very geeky hardware topic ahead. 

In the last few weeks I have worked on running Ethereum nodes on RISC-V boards. RISC-V is one of the more modern CPU architectures besides the well known x86 (most PCs) and ARM (Apple and cell phones). RISC-V started being developed around 2010 and got published around 2014. Only in the last few years the basic parts got standardized and the they are still in active development to standardize some of the extensions.  

One big difference is than anyone can design and build CPUs on this standard and many companies actually do. This is in contrast to x86 processors where only 3 companies have a license to actually design/build them: Intel, AMD, VIA Technologies. 
For ARM CPUs anyone who buys a license from ARM Holdings can design and build ARM CPUs but these licenses can be very strict. For example, ARM Holdings is currently trying to force Qualcomm to destroy all ARM based Windows laptops due to a licensing dispute. 
RISC-V is open, which means anyone can design and build processors following this standard without having to pay anyone anything or follow any strict licensing rules. This means this is the most open CPU architecture we have. The disadvantage is that it is all very new and therefore the currently available Processors are not the most powerful ones. But the progress in just the last 5 years is quite amazing. Back then one could only get the most minimal boards which pretty much could only read some inputs do some basic calculations and control an output. There was no support to run any operating system on these boards. Linux support was pretty much non existent. 

Today, we can get boards which can easily run full Linux distributions even Ubuntu supports some boards directly and about every 9 months a new iteration of ever more powerful boards hit the market. The driver for this development is the openness. Companies know, that no one can take their licenses away and this gives them security to develop RISC-V based CPUs. This open competition will probably enable many more people to get access to affordable and powerful enough hardware to run an ethereum node. To get there however, the node clients themselves will have to be optimized for this hardware platform as well. 

That is why another node operator was asking in many discords if anyone else is interested to help in this effort. I obviously jumped on this opportunity and we have been working on it in the last few weeks. We now got Nimbus, Lighthouse and geth running. They can be built with some modifications and run reliably. Some of the modifications have already been pushed to the respective client teams and some more modifications will come in the next weeks. We are working on some other clients as well (grandine, Reth and prysm) but they have some more issues which need further investigation.

At the moment we have 4 different boards to test our stuff on. These are the HiFive Unmatched, the VisionFive 2, the Lichee Pi 4a and the Banana Pi F3. All of these are at most barely powerful enough to actually run a full node. Nevertheless, we managed to fully and reliably sync the sepolia testnet on the Banana Pi (Nimbus/geth) and we even managed to sync mainnet with lighthouse, but only for brief periods of time until it lost sync again and then it was behind the head for about 1-3 hours until it regained sync again. We even overclocked our board which slightly improved the sync reliability, but not by much. Looks like the current iteration of boards is a good basis to test nodes and get the clients ready but we need at least one more iteration to be able to run nodes reliably. 

In parallel, my colleague tries to incorporate as many improvements as necessary into eth-docker so that prospective node operators will have a very convenient way to spin up a node on these boards. It still is a very rocky road ahead, but I am pretty sure that when actually powerfull enough RISC-V boards will hit the market in 1-3 years or so, a good selection of clients will be ready to run on them.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi reminds us of the purpose of EIP-1559</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ewn8dw/daily_general_discussion_august_20_2024/lj2uzn0/)

It's a little complicated because EIP-1559 served multiple purposes, and the burn achieved multiple goals. You can read all about it in the github of the EIP (it's short, and really digestible - I promise!) --- [EIPs/EIPS/eip-1559.md at master ¬∑ ethereum/EIPs ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)

The short of it is, the burn was absolutely a stated part of monetary policy, to the point I'd argue it was past 'a nice side effect'. Honestly a fairly elegant solution IMO. And if you remember the narratives around BTC vs ETH at the time of it's launch, issuance/inflation rates were a very hot topic. 

I think where the disconnect came from was people misunderstood that it was an amplifier, not a driver, of price action. Meaning that in the event we saw a period of relatively little crypto demand combined with low fees the burn wouldn't be as impactful. Which we sort of unfortunately saw post-launch. 

>An important aspect of this fee system is that miners only get to keep the priority fee. The base fee is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol). This ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform and reducing risks associated with miner extractable value (MEV). Additionally, this burn counterbalances Ethereum inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee to miners. Finally, ensuring the miner of a block does not receive the base fee is important because it removes miner incentive to manipulate the fee in order to extract more fees from users.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll covers the pragmatic approach to privacy which many apathetic people may miss</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1exh5g5/daily_general_discussion_august_21_2024/lj693g9/)

I just thought I'd share a snippet I shared just now in yesterday's daily about why the defeatist attitude to privacy around "oh they have my data anyway" is actually completely missing the point of privacy. It's not about going off the grid, its about reducing your attack surface and if you hold crypto, then reducing your data footprint is not paranoia, it's prudent.

>One of the key things outsiders miss about the privacy community is the concept of the "threat model". Who are you trying to hide your data from? Most people can't hide from 3 letter agencies without hugely inconveniencing their daily life, but that's ok because there are some legal protections to stop some degree of government abuse (for example police need to get warrants to search your home etc.) But if you post all of your life details to social media then police can just buy your data, they don't need to search your home if they can buy info from tech companies. Stalkers and $5 wrench attackers can do the same and hackers have waaaay more places to steal your info from, making you more prone to phishing, burglary and much much more. Basically there are some super simple steps to make your digital footprint soooo much smaller. Things like degoogling, using uBlock origin and Firefox for browsing, avoiding cloud services in favour of physical backups or your own servers and not owning a car made after the mid 2010s which collects and sells location and converstional data ([some car companies reserve the right to sell your sexual data, no I'm not kidding, its right there in their terms and conditions](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/)). These things don't take much effort for tech savvy people and it gets 80 ‚Äì 90% of your data off the marketplace and out of the easy reach of government agencies beyond the most powerful ones which you don't really need to worry about if you're not a terrorist.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal shares their experience at EDCON</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ei1pba/daily_general_discussion_august_2_2024/lg5jqfg/)

(1/2)

I broke my no conference rule and attended EDCON in Tokyo this year. Didn't see any posts about it, but maybe I missed them, it's been hectic running around to try to attend everything (and missing most of it). Either way I thought I'd share my subjective experience as a normally privacy-conscious grumpy internet man.

First, the quality of that conference was impressive. On every aspect. Coordinating any event is no easy task, and here the organization was top notch. As someone who doesn't speak a word of Japanese and can hardly mumble coherent English, the EDCON team aptly corraled me and others wherever they needed to be.

Great venues too. Most days we were at the United Nations building. I think the whole building catered to the convention? One big conference room housing about ~400 people for the main talks, and side conference rooms for side talks/workshops. Then the main 2 days took place at the Yoyogi gymnasiums, which were OK for the more festive atmospheres they were meant to be, but a bit iffy on acoustics when it comes to listening to technical talks.

Of course this is what matters most, the quality of these talks. I have to say this did not disappoint. There's something to be said for being committed to an event and passively sitting there for hours, as opposed to surfing the Internet and actively seeking knowledge. Whether you want it or not, when you're physically present your brain starts to absorb knowledge like a plant does photosynthetis.

In particular, I found all the talks on MPC (Multi Party Computation), TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) especially interesting. Many of us have seen these terms many times, the most adventurous among us even try to read Vitalik's blogs on the topic. Personally it still failed to click for me. Until I sat in these rooms and saw the points explained and reexplained in a variety of different ways by various speakers.

Major props in particular to the panel between Guy Itzhaki (Fhenix), Zhen Yu Yong (Web3Auth), Chua Zheng Leong (Automata). Three guys who manifestly know their stuff and engaged with each other to make these concepts obvious to the crowd. The theme was MPC vs TEE vs FHE, but really it came down to them explaining where each solution makes the most sense. I don't know when EDCON will put the videos of these talks online, but if there's one panel I'd suggest watching, it would be this one.

In person, you truly get to see who's passionate and who's acting. Either that or there were some excellent actors. The aura of highbrained discussion shifts your perspective, you get caught in the enthusiasm. When I first saw Fhenix (which is a L2) online, my cynical ass thought oh joy, they took FHE and made a little play with Phenix, how "clever". Post conference? Oh, they took FHE and made a little wordplay with Phenix! How clever! (his frown and cynicism: gone)

Another protocol that flipped me 180 was Zircuit. Initially (online) their marketing as an AI-powered L2 made me scoff. But the talk by their CTO made an excellent case for the future of sequencers, differentiating themselves by subjective qualities rather than the objective increases of scale. I got to speak with one of their devs, who told me the AI is really used for data analysis, to classify the possible pathways for DeFi hacks we've seen in the past, and then identify transactions that look functionally similar and send them in quarantine before inspection. Which is entirely sensible when you think about it. So many exploits boil down to flashloans, oracle manipulations and high changes of volume in a single block, that it should be not only possible but practical to build heuristics to defeat most common attack vectors.

Needless to say, I'm now accumulating some Zircuit points...

Intmax people were on several panels, and then they featured proeminently at Plasmacon the next day as they were organizing it. Justin Drake had a pretty cool gigabrain (omegabrain?) talk about it. I won't even try to pretend I can explain, save that you can run pretty aggressive compressions for payment usecases. 

Justin also made the interesting case BTC as an asset could survive a 51% attack (which in his opinion will happen within ~10 years) by using one-shot quantum signatures and leaving the PoW chain behind. Right, I understand some of these words.

Adrian Brink of Anoma had several talks on completely different topics, all great stuff. He's a good speaker and obviously a smart man, if a little bit too smart as his presentations tend to end up too dense with information. I liked his hot take in Plasmacon the most, paraphrased: if we define scalability as the ability to retain fixed costs no matter the activity, then rollups are not a viable scaling solution, while Plasma can be. Personally I think the burden on app developers (who have to guarantee data availability or think of the right incentive mechanisms for others to provide it) is too large for the time being, and I would not bet on Plasma being big at scale before 2030, but what do I know?

The more relevant point, maybe, is that a whole lot of people are clearly building for 2030 and beyond. If you're ever looking for a fix of optimism to distract you from market trends or cryptotwitter feuds, I will wholeheartedly vouch for EDCON. This could not have been better exemplified than by Vitalik's keynotes.

Finally got to see the unicorn... scratch that, the horse... amend that, the man... on stage. There is a special sort of energy to his talks. You can tell he's exposing his concrete, factual vision for the space, which he makes accessible to the rest of us but doesn't massage, inflate, nor reduce, in any other way. But I also liked the energy of his body language. Always moving around, pacing from one leg to another, the frame of someone who speaks of a topic he knows in and out and wishes our input/output bandwidth as human beings could stretch to accomodate the full speed of his thoughts as fast as they come. It hits different when mr Buterin says we can scale, because it MEANS we CAN scale.
 
The focus was on the next 10 years of Ethereum, touching on where we were, where we're at and where we're going. Main idea: we got the fees down, now we need to get back to 2016 UX of a monolithic construction from the user perspective. Main pathways: gas auctions (you have ETH on any rollup, someone else broadcasts your transaction on the desired rollup for a fee, competition should push that fee down to negligible levels), chain prefixes (op:0x1234 and arb:0x1234 instead of 0x1234, handled at the wallet/dapp level, all you see and use is 0x1234 and everything is taken care of).

In closing, he suggested the infra is good and we should expect to see a shift in focus towards applications. Music to my ears.

(re: unicorn. On the final day, Vitalik came in a Bufficorn costume. Then removed it to reveal his secret identity as a humanoid horse holding Dogecoin. Then became human. I feel the genius in that costume is that he waddled around the conference for hours before, incognito. How do you attend a show when you're a rockstar billionaire? Without the suit he would have been crowded all the time, but as a mascot most people seemed to blissfully ignore him.)

(2/2)

So the main stuff was good. And there was a lot more to it! The hackathons were great, you get to see what people are building. Much of it was sponsored by zkSync. There was a funny dynamic to this. First you'd hear the zkSync guys describe their newest infra directions, the possibilities it allows. Then the hackers would show up on stage... and after their presentations, would be assaulted by technical questions from the very same zkSync people. "What do you think about this potential issue? Have you thought about using specific feature X in your app? What about..." All in good form, benevolent, but nonetheless you got the vibe of Infra Nobility questioning Application Peasants. If there ever was a need to illustrate this current reality in our industry, I think it was on display there, in those poor hackers' confused answers.

zkSync had the best swag. They brought their eli5 books (which you might have already seen here: https://eli5.zksync.io/ ), in Japanese and English. A 200-piece puzzle box. Their mascot "Zeek" was proeminently featured. They're killing it on branding, it's stuff you're happy to own because it looks visually pleasing, and it's appropriate for kids too.

They had this pretty slick zkQuest website too: https://zkquest.zksync.io

Which you activated by going to their booth. It let you do a bunch of developer quests, ranging from very simple to rather involved, and covered a large spread of topics in their ecosystem. You got real ETH for finishing those quests, and the amounts were rather generous! Doing everything could net you about 0.065 ETH.

(Most people didn't. I only managed less than half, and I'm in the top50 leaderboard.)

Oh, and finishing the first set of easier quests got you the coolest swag, a Zeek hat. It was genuinely cool to see people wandering around with theirs on, you could tell who's engaging deeply with the developer side of the conference. Status signals like this make for fun crowd dynamics.

The PSE research group (pse.dev) worked the same magic in their FHE panel. They demonstrated this app letting you connect with other people by tapping your NFC-enabled phone to a ring, to then let you make private groups and vote on various things anonymously. In the end everyone who participated got a NFC black ring. More subtle than a Zeek hat, it was neat to spot other ringbearers in the wild through the rest of the conference.

The entertainment was fun. Partly because there was clear confusion between the attendees and the shows. You hear stories about fans going ga-ga for Kpop, then you're here watching tripleS get on stage and half of the crowd is getting up and walking away.

(It was just after Vitalik's keynote. You could see the flow of the wave moving in for his talk, then moving back out. Half of the total crowd or so.)

I made it a purpose to approach this conference while revealing as little about myself as possible. I did not specify my job, my occupation, made it a point to say I was neither a developer nor an investor, didn't tell my name, never connected my Twitter or Telegram to anything. My goal in that was to see how open the culture is, to check whether reputation/identity are defacto requirements or if people are willing to engage with you regardless.

The conference scored highly on that scale. I applied to almost all side events, and almost everyone let me in. I didn't try to approach people, but several individuals came to me. Out of them only one I would qualify as a shitcoin shiller, and even then he was fairly respectful and didn't try to push beyond giving me the swag. Everyone else was insightful, loved to trade ideas and talk about what they were doing. I'm not a particularly charismatic person, so to come in anonymous and get this amount of positive sentiment and friendliness freely extended... truly suggests, at least to me, the community has done a good job translating the "permissionless" concept to real life.

There was a good spread of side events. Whatever it is you wanted to do. If you wanted to go deep into some technical topic, there was a side event for that in a crowded classroom somewhere. If you wanted to watch Japanese idols sing some songs about smart contracts being the next hope of humanity, there was a side event for that too. I went to everything I could, if only because as a first-time Japan tourist it made for a guide to discover the hot spots in town. It was a good reminder blockchain leans young. You could count the people with grey hair on your two hands, if not two fingers.

Subjective conclusion to subjective experience. I had a blast. In life it's easy to nerd out and it's easy to have fun, but it can be hard to find a crowd doing both. I'm also flabbergasted this value is delivered essentially for free. As the EDCON tickets were given to anyone who applied near the end. There was a healthy mix of foreigners to locals, maybe about 60:40. Most of the talks were in English with some AI real-time translation in Japanese.

Strangely enough, it only reaffirmed my belief going to conferences is a tricky path. As in, you can lose sight of the "real" users, onchain. Free tickets to attend or no, the guy from Serbia who makes ‚Ç¨600 a month is not hopping on a flight to Tokyo anytime soon. The attendance was definitely biaised towards rich, and it's easy to feel optimistic when you're here either because you're financially independent or because your well-paid job foots the bill.

There's a counterpoint in that the Ethereum community goes through significant effort to diversify event locations and to make things accessible. At this point there's probably something somewhere anyone could attend, given a reasonable effort.

It's hard to stay objective when you're having a good time. I now have so much positive bias towards several protocols based on my people encounters. There's a reason many societies have strict anti-bribery laws, most of us get swayed easily; and man do I feel bribed out in the abundance of free stuff thrown my way.

But you know what? Maybe objectivity is overrated. Brings to mind a certain WEF video: "welcome to the 2030 roadmap. I own all the things, I have some privacy, and life has never been better."

If you ever feel down about this space and have the opportunity to attend, do yourself a favor and take the plunge.

<summary>u/pa7x1 speculates on future blobspace price and demand</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ei1pba/daily_general_discussion_august_2_2024/lg4xqgc/)

Estimating the late game economics of blobspace. This is just a quick back of the envelope math, to get a taste of the numbers. Feel free to tweak the assumptions as you see fit. With current blobspace target of 3 blobs (1 shard):

500 tps x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 secs per year = 15800M transactions per year

Say average transaction fee is 5 cents. Which would make the median even lower, around 1-2 cents. Making even the lowest added value use cases (e.g. pay for coffee) perfectly viable. This is likely extremely conservative because if we start having serious financial applications on top of Ethereum (i.e. tokenized RWA) those fees are ridiculously low. Your broker charges you easily 5 USD per transaction. And registration of car titles, houses, etc... is even more expensive. So it could push the average much higher easily.

15800M tx per year x 0.05 USD per tx = 800M USD per year

Say Ethereum captures 80% of that. This assumption is based on the current burn %, which has typically floated around 80% of the tx cost. This is the trickiest assumption, I don't have a good way of estimating how much value will be captured by Ethereum from the L2 transaction fees. This is dependent on the attractiveness of data availability on Ethereum vs all other options. So feel free to tweak this value. If we assume 80%, that gives us 640M USD per year with 1 shard.

With full danksharding we will go up to 64 shards. So that would puts of the order of 40B USD per year of burn just from blobspace. That gives you an implied price of ETH of 30-35K USD just from blobspace alone. Add to that Ethereum's proper blockspace which in the past has been able to capture a similar figure of burn and you get to a price of ETH around 50K to 100K USD. The price estimate is simply a consequence of assuming ETH cannot be absurdly deflationary, if it were it would cause a supply crunch and the price would go upwards resulting in less burn until it estabilizes around the price that gets us to close to 0 inflation.

Mind you, this is a long-term view of the roadmap. It will take us still years to deliver Danksharding and 64 shards and onboard all the use cases. But it serves to illustrate how the ETH late-game economics could look like.

Disagree with any of the numbers? Change them! The point is not so much to derive a specific figure, but to get a sense of the order of magnitudes we would be dealing with.

<summary>u/SeaMonkey82 has a warning for all validators</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ejnbk4/daily_general_discussion_august_4_2024/lgjezl6/)

Word of warning to any validators out there - I recently updated all of my Linux Mint 21.3 systems to Linux Mint 22, and every one of them that had chronyd configured had it removed during the upgrade process.  My one Ubuntu 22.04 server also didn't have it after upgrading to 24.04, but I'm not certain that one ever did, so I don't know if this is par for the course for *any* Ubuntu-based distribution or if it's specific to LInux Mint.  
  
In any case, if you aren't running chronyd for timesync, I recommend it.  There's [a CoinCashew guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/archived-guides/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/synchronizing-time-with-chrony) for setting it up, but I recommend relaxing the frequency settings to `minpoll 2` and `maxpoll 10` to avoid KoD RATE messages.

<summary>u/MrCatFace13 shares a memo from Bitwise</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ekfjb6/daily_general_discussion_august_5_2024/lgnetn9/)

The most recent Bitwise memo from Matt Hougan is pretty great. Here is the relevant section:

*The last time the market melted down like this was March 12, 2020. That was the day the world realized that Covid was a big deal.*

*In case you‚Äôve blocked it from your memory, let me remind you: It was chaos.*

*The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 2,353 points on March 12, its worst day since 1987. Tech stocks were in free fall, as were commodities. We all thought the global economy was going to end. The president would declare a national emergency the following morning.*

*Among all assets, bitcoin crashed the worst, falling 37% from $7,911 to $4,971. It was a breathtaking one-day move, wiping out a year‚Äôs worth of gains in 24 hours.*

*It felt as if we might never recover. The media claimed bitcoin had failed its test as a hedge asset.*

*And then something spectacular happened. As global leaders stepped in to stabilize the economy‚Äîcutting interest rates, printing money‚Äîbitcoin began to rise. A year later, it was trading at $57,332, up more than 1,000%.*

*In retrospect, March 12, 2020 wasn‚Äôt a time to panic. It was the best buying opportunity for bitcoin in a decade.*

*It‚Äôs easy to see why with the benefit of hindsight. Nothing fundamental had changed about bitcoin because of Covid. The maximum number of bitcoin that could exist (21 million) was the same on March 11 as it was on March 12. You didn't need to rely on any bank, government, or company to store wealth in bitcoin on March 11, and that was still true on March 12.*

*At the same time, Covid supercharged the reasons for bitcoin‚Äôs long-term rise. It showed that central banks would bail out the economy at the first sign of trouble. It demonstrated the limitations of centralized institutions. And it reminded us that the future is more online and digital.*

*The changes all pointed in favor of bitcoin becoming more important, not less. And in the long term, that‚Äôs exactly what happened.*

*I see the same setup today.*

Edit to add this:

*But, in brief: Weak economic data in the U.S. on Friday sparked concerns that the global economy is slowing. This prompted a panic in Asia, where a rapid unwind of the yen carry trade‚Äîa strategy aimed at exploiting interest-rate differentials between currencies‚Äîpushed Japanese markets sharply lower. Things weren‚Äôt helped by rising concerns over geopolitical risks in the Middle East, where Iran is threatening to attack Israel.*

*These events collided with idiosyncratic negative developments in the crypto market, where a large market maker (Jump Trading) ran into trouble and faced forced liquidations of large positions in ETH.*

<summary>u/Dreth fact checks their own comment from a few days ago and u/pa7x1 also has some great input on the macro topic at hand</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1el99as/daily_general_discussion_august_6_2024/lgqvde3/)

[u/Dreth](https://reddit.com/u/Dreth):

Yesterday I made an (apparently) well received [lengthy comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ekfjb6/daily_general_discussion_august_5_2024/lgktwts/) of disorganized thoughts regarding the stock market crash that ocurred this week. I want to correct some inaccuracies or imprecise details I explained regarding the particular events in japan.

The immediate cause is the carry trade, but some corrections about it and the situation in Japan:

> The first immediate reason why this happened is because while the FED and the ECB raised rates to control inflation, the BOJ kept rates at 0. This lack of coordination with other central banks, which is entirely within the rights of the BOJ as a central bank of an independent nation, but not ideal, has made a very profitable trade: borrow money in japan, sell JPY, buy USD or EUR and put that money to work in public debt or other yield bearing instrumnets, or if you prefer a riskier trade, buy stocks denominated in other currencies. So both the FED/ECB and BOJ are at fault because they kept rates high for too long and keeping rates low for too long respectively, creating a very profitable trade. Hence why central bank coordination matters in large markets.

And also bad data from other directions causing more drawdown in the market in the days prior to yesterday's crash: 

> The market had already been pricing in a slowdown in the economy, with unexpectedly low job creation in the US and less than ideal earnings from US companies, though the most concerning figure was the job data. This is likely what caused that first drawdown that brought us to 2700-2900 in the past couple days. But other markets have also been slowing down, not just the US, China too apparently, and Europe we already knew was weak economically from several different directions. Just an example of Europe's weakness at the moment could be seen through [Germany's GDP growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth), which shows a contracting or stagnant economy, rate hikes most definitely affect this by reducing demand and making credit more expensive, and Germany already had had a weak 2022 with [lots of noise in its trade balance](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/balance-of-trade) as a result of the sanctions to Russia, though this is old news.

Some inaccuracies I layed out that I want to rectify/correct:

> I said the BOJ had had near-zero or zero % interest rates for almost a decade, but it's way more than that. [The BOJ has had interest rates at zero for MOST of the past 20 years](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/interest-rate), with short periods of increase that never went above 0.5%.
>
> Hence this trade being not just _recently_ profitable, but _historically_ profitable, especially because this monetary policy from the BOJ was intended to remain for as long as possible. Even now the rates are extremely low, at 0.25% despite increases. The higher the difference between the BOJ rates and the FED/ECB rates, the more profitable this trade becomes, especially because the JPY was particularly weak vs these currencies, so the profit is double, you earn from shorting JPY relative to USD or EUR and you earn from having high interest rates, so the JPY weakness came from a lot more people taking this short position in JPY. Though this was especially profitable recently.
>
> I said that the BOJ wanted to end the carry trade. This is not necessarily true, the BOJ only wants inflation in japan and purchasing power to remain static or to increase (currently [Japan's economy has been contracting](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/gdp-growth)). The carry trade had been hurting the JPY causing loss of purchasing power because (one example) e.g. commercially, if their currency is lower, their exports are cheaper, but imports are more expensive. Generally this hurts citizens, so the BOJ increased rates to reduce this disparity and give a little more strength to the JPY.
> 
> Given that many traders expected the rates to not increase in any meaningful way, and especially expecting the _intent to increase them_ from the BOJ would remain the same, many traders took recent short positions on an already weak JPY, which caused a large cascade of margin calls on JPY borrowers performing carry trades, resulting in that immediate large rise in the JPY.
> 
> I won't get into why the [Nikkei crashed](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EN225/) harder than it ever had in history, it could be due to several factors, but I haven't done any profound research on it. It could be margin calls due to shares being collateral to loans, it could be due to bad earnings, idk, there's probably multiple things at play here.

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

Pretty good content, both yesterday and today. Some quick complementary comments.

BOJ cannot raise substantially interest rates because Japan's debt to GDP is a ridiculous 263%. This ties their hands, their interest payments would go through the roof. Yes, their debt is issued in Yen. They could always print more but you are just trading one evil for another one.

Nikkei went down because the Yen is strengthening to reflect the new conditions. Japan's economy depends a lot on exports. If the Yen goes up their exports are less competitive. This compresses earnings of their companies. Markets try to see into the future and price that. Plus minus any short term market turmoil, liquidations, etc... But this is short term noise. 

The carry trade is not ending here, it has started to unwind. The yield differential is going to keep existing for quite a while as it's related to point 1. Because of that yield differential the Yen should be weaker and devaluing over very long time horizons (decades). What we have seen is just the tip of the iceberg, the most degen of the degen levered to their tits, getting exposed when the market moves a bit against them. And having to close down positions in a disordered manner. Seems some liquidations must have happened but nothing is publicly known yet.

<summary>u/ProfessionalNoiseX opens up about their recent liquidation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1el99as/daily_general_discussion_august_6_2024/lgqfz2w/)

*/rant, skip if you don't like sad stories but I need someone to hear me out for my sanity*

These are the hardest days for me ever.

The other day I got liquidated on my ratio long on the scam wick. It was not a very aggressive position (actual breakeven ratio for collateral/debt was at 0.0355) but I guess it got to 90% LTV on the protocol anyway.

I did not expect the ratio to drop that much that fast and I was stubborn and did not reduce it in the coming hours when it was at 0.045.

This is where I don't know if I can ever get closure. The protocol that I have used (which I don't want to badmouth but it definitely has some design issues) leaves the difference between liquidation threshold and actual value all to the liquidator. All this to say that the guy liquidated me at barely 90% LTV and actually got a 27ETH payout on a 225 ETH position because it probably actually bounced back in the time it took for him to actually exchange the BTC for ETH.

If I had not been liquidated, that position would be worth something like 40 more ETH than I have now. Had i kept most of that 10% it would have been 25ETH. Instead, I have zero left from that position. I feel like I got robbed.

So, for me that's it. I am back at my initial ETH stack after all these years of working to increase it (I was at my record just over a month ago at 2x the current ETH amount) and now I'm just left with years of stress for nothing.

I can't honestly bounce back from this, I don't have the mental strength nor the stack to risk it anymore. I know that I would probably blow the rest trying to get it back quickly.

I don't know how will I ever overcome this, I have missed real life goals and have been stressed constantly trying to increase my internet coins and now I have lost all that I had built.

I will stick around and follow the progress for Ethereum for which I truly believe in, just with a different outlook for myself and a bad memory of all these years. Hopefully I will be able to partially forgive myself for the mistakes I have made, because right now I am unable to.

Thanks r/ethfinance, you truly have been a beacon of light in all these years and that will be always a nice memory for me.

Damn, I'm reading comments from overleveraged people after yesterday's events. It's a trip down memory lane (2018-2020), where plenty of people lost their precious eth. The biggest ethfinance loss I'm aware of was an 8000 eth position that got halved (back then we were talking about a couple of million $ iirc).  

There are no "big lessons" imo. You just have to go through these events to learn, or at the very least, treat much more carefully than you think.  

To those who have lost a lot yesterday (and the prior weeks), I hope you find your way out of it. It's not easy. At least the tech is "proven" right now and eth isn't going to zero.

<summary>u/NeedlerOP shares some reasons to be bullish</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1em3ca0/daily_general_discussion_august_7_2024/lgydx2j/)

Things to be bullish about :

* ETH ETFs & positive flows
* +ve YOY M2 supply after 16 months of contraction (in layman terms, Powell is printing)
* We just had a black swan one per 10 year VIX event comparable to COVID crash and '08 financial crash
* ETH Retail is shitting the bed due to poor risk management, and is selling now to institutions
* Bitcoin Dominance & Altcoin Dominance Cycle theory points towards alt capitulation and a Q4 Alt-season. I'm under the belief we have experienced the last flush accelerated by the BOJ black swan, instead of mid Q4.
* ETH is underperforming all assets within the space currently
* As an example, in 2019, after the Mid-cycle top, we saw crypto markets & ratio bottom after 75 bps of cuts, which will be 2 FED meetings in our case (Early Nov)
* The time to be bearish was last week, you're fucked now and it may be too late to be bearish

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll talks about mindsets after a setback</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1em3ca0/daily_general_discussion_august_7_2024/lgx301z/)

I just wanted to share a bit of a mindset change I've had over the last couple of years in this bear market which I discussed in response to a fellow EthFinancier at the end of yesterday's daily who lost a lot of ETH (but not their whole stack) to a liquidation this week. I'd love to hear how everyone else who is quite far into this game has had their mindset change over time. I also hope it doesn't come off as pretentious. I'm not some zen guru who is holier than thou for being grateful for what I have. Far from it. I just stress a lot less and chase that calculating my net worth dopamine hit much much less and I hope others can achieve that too.

> Hey friend, I can relate. I lost about 30% of my stack to shitcoins and another 20% I have cashed out because I let my lifestyle adapt based on a price movement (last bullrun) which didn't stay around and which I didn't take anywhere near enough profits on but still had a lot of taxes to pay. I recognise that your story probably stings a lot more than mine ever did with the scam wick, but I think the important difference here is I am 2 years further down the line after taking a big L than you are.
> 
> After the my big sudden L with a couple of shitcoins which basically went to 0, I went cold turkey on the bullshit. Anything risky is out of my portfolio. No shitcoins, no leverage. Not even "blue chip" or darling altcoins like LINK or RPL. At the end of the day they're all about taking on risk to get more ETH. But that's just a form of gambling. So all that's left is DCAing (which is out of the picture for me as a student) and staking. So I've just been comfortably holding and staking for the last two years. As time has gone on, I have come to terms with not being able to attain my more lofty price targets and bullish financial goals. Instead I have focused on what I do have. And holy fuck, I'm only sitting on one home validator but my god, this still puts me way ahead of anyone else my age that wasn't born into the 1%. This bear market has been humbling for me in a good way. I'm no longer trying to gamble for more ETH, so I have had time to reflect on what I have and how much freedom it can bring me, how much less it makes me stress over tough financial situations on a daily basis.
> 
> My friend, hang in there. You have not lost it all. In fact, if you're patient and responsible, you're right about to find what it is you have and it's more than you think. Just give your mind time to adapt as it moves away from a dopamine filled moon chasing, ETH gambling mindset and towards a more grounded and grateful one. I hope it doesn't sound cheesy or pretentious. But losing half of my stack has been good for my wisdom, financial responsibility and mental health. Try not to stress about it all too much and just let it be. From the sounds of it you're still in this game and I don't want to lose any more EthFinanciers to liquidations and high risk plays.

>I know it is painful now, but it will get better. You've just got to focus on the right things.

> <sub>Forgive me for my liberal use of the word gambling. You know what I mean though. It's taking on risk with large sums of money which really shouldn't be at so much risk.</sub>

They asked Ray to flippen

But he just kept on dippin'

Mayhaps life can't be judged by this criterium

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ecfslx/daily_general_discussion_july_26_2024/lf17lnb/)

When discussing crypto, and comparing ETH with BTC/alts online and offline, I can easily refute all points against ETH. Ethereum is so well thought out and designed, that it seems there are literally no weak points, and you can easily debate its superiority.

But I'm wondering about one point that I don't have the technical knowledge to easily counter. Many altcoiners say that ETH suffers from "spaghetti code", and a large technical debt that is going to be a big issue going forward, either by eventually causing a huge bug and collapse of the blockchain, or by just slowing down its further development and letting other, better written coins come on top.

So I'm asking anyone that's more into Ethereum's technicals/developement than I am. Is there any truth to this claim? My answer would usually be that Ethereum was mostly accused of slow development, which would indicate prioritizing quality over speed, but this isn't concrete proof that the code is *actually* good quality. How would *you* reply to someone that claims that Ethereum's code is bad code?

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard has a warning for all Compound users</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1eer8s9/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2024/lfjd5u5/)

Regarding the recent [Compound governance attack](https://x.com/azflin/status/1817659068967768555?s=61) the real danger here isn't that they rugged the treasury. However much they stole there isn't enough liquidity to exit that amount. The real danger is they went from having outsized control of the governance to do something like this to defacto ownership of the governance system to do whatever else they want soon.

I'll remind everyone that Compound doesn't use isolated lending pools. Every depositor/borrowable asset is at risk against price losses of every collateral asset. So the real risk here is that they mint a token e.g. LogrisShitCoin, seed it against a tiny amount of liquidity to give it a price while owning 100% of it, vote to enable use of that token as collateral, borrow all the assets in Compound, and let the liquidations rack up bad debt behind them.

If you have assets in Compound this is your cue to switch to an isolated lending pool strategy. We used to have more of these but some like Rari and Euler have gone the way of the dodo. Euler v2 is just around the corner but given their history I'd probably give that a year before trying it. Otherwise I can recommend Silo, Gearbox, Ajna, or Llamalend.

<summary>u/HSuke brainstorms scam prevention techniques then like 2 peas in a pod u/Dreth shares a book chapter they wrote on avoiding scams</summary>

It's really cool that I was able to traverse back one day at a time [a whole year](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15dcqqy/daily_general_discussion_july_30_2023/ju2784k/) via Daily Doots without encountering a single broken link. Great job, u/Tricky_Troll and Substidoots!

----------

Anyways, I was looking for a list of scams techniques that our community has encountered. Here's a short summary of the scams and how to avoid them, if even possible.

####**Google Ad links**

**How it worked**: User searched for polymarket and clicked on a google sponsored ad link (right above the actual link) directing to an identical page with a 1-character domain name difference. User then signed a permit Tx draining user of a specific token.

**How to prevent**:

1. Be extremely careful with Google ad links.
1. Also be careful with domain typo squatting. Entering "Umiswap" instead of "Uniswap" is all it takes to get drained.
1. Test with a small amount first, and don't do unlimited approvals/permits on the test transation

A wallet guard or advanced-security wallet like Rabby wallet can prevent some of these kinds of attacks.

####**Bridge hack**

**How it worked**: DeFI protocol LI.FI's L2 Bridge got hacked. Contract was drained. (User narrowly avoided hack by using good practices.)

**How to prevent**: Don't approve more than you need to use. Try to use official bridges when possible. Be careful with DeFi bridges. 

####**Persistent spear phishing attack + Homoglyph attack**

**How it worked**: Attacker called and emailed multiple times about a known recent hack of specific account belonging to the user that got its info leaked (the leak part was true). They had the user's account due to the recent leak. The domain was indistinguishable from the official domain, but it used an identical-looking foreign character instead of the real English character (**a homoglyph**). User didn't fall for it, but attack was convincing due to its persistence and professionalism.

**How to prevent**: Remain skeptical about calls and emails. Always be wary of ayone who tries to rush you into making hasty decisions. Always check email and website domains, though in this case that wouldn't have helped since the domain was practically indistinguishable (homoglyph). In this case, don't click on the email link. Instead, retype the link in the address bar.

####**Home break-in with armed attackers**

**How attacked**: Crypto dev with 10k followers had a home break-in with armed attackers

**How to prevent**: Well, this is really hard to prevent if you already have your info public due to a previous mass data leak. Everyone has already had their data leaked multiple times. If you're rich, maybe get good security and have a throwaway wallet. Honestly, I don't really have a good way to prevent this. On the other hand, this attack is not specific to crypto.

####**Address poisoning a test transaction**

**How it worked**: User made test transaction (which is good practice) in preparation for a bigger transaction. Immediately got address-poisoned by an attacker monitoring whale addresses. User then used the poisoned address from the account's transaction history. (Story seems a bit fishy since the user should've been an expert at avoiding common attacks.)

**How to prevent**: Use an address book with whitelisted addresses. Be wary of address poisoning attacks. Don't copy addresses from the transaction history.

####**Liquidity Pool was hacked**

**How it worked**: Self-explanitory. Liquidity Pool was hacked. User's LP wallet was drained.

**How to prevent**: Be careful when joining LPs. Some of them have bugs or exploits. User was able to avoid heavy damage because he kept his LP wallet separated from his main wallets.

####**Warpcast frames**

**How it worked**: Blindly trusting a mint via a Warpcast frame

**How to prevent**: Don't immediately assume that people on Warpcast are trustworthy. Treat it like a slightly-safer Twitter.

####**Supply-side attack**

**How it worked**: 2 separate reports for this kind of hack. In one, a hacker pulled off a BGP hijack (compromises routing protocol) of a crypto platform's service provider. In another, hacker compromised a github account of a library the a wallet software used.

**How to prevent**: If you're the end user, there is no practical way to prevent this kind of attack. It doesn't matter if it's crypto or traditional finance, a supply-side attack can destroy you, and there's very little you can do about it. Stick with wallets and platforms that have good security practices to minimize the chances of this happening. Realistically, if some infrastructure's DNS or BGP gets hijacked, even crypto security experts can get screwed.

####**Fake revoke scam**

**How it worked**: This got reported multiple times, though I don't think anyone on the sub fell for it. Basically, after a large hack, scammers would link to fake revoke_dot_cash sites hoping to trick careless users who were rushing to revoke their approvals/permits.

**How to prevent**: Don't fall for schemes that try to rush you into doing something and making a careless mistake. Type in website addresses manually.

[u/Dreth](https://reddit.com/u/Dreth):

In 2022, I started writing a book on crypto, that I intended to self publish to help complete beginners get a head start on the philosophy of crypto, how to get into it, how to self custody funds and how to avoid scams. 

I never quite finished everything, I had a little over 30 thousand words, but I did ask for help for scam examples in this subreddit at the time.

Today I decided to publish the 'identifying and avoiding scams' section because the longer I wait to ever publish this, the more outdated it'll be. It's likely already outdated. It was still missing some examples I wanted to show, but I believe it's already valuable enough to at least post here.

Here it is in case anyone wants to take a look: <https://dac.ac/blog/identifying_and_avoiding_crypto_scams>

Feedback is appreciated too, just bear in mind that not even I have given it a full re-read in a couple years.

There's an acknowledgements section at the bottom giving credit to those who helped me out, but I want give a shout out to them here too:

- u/alexiskef for many of the discord DM 
- u/busterrulezzz for his writing tips and his narration of the experience he had on a crypto startup that turned out to be a scam narrated on r/CryptoCurrency (don't worry I didn't copy it or anything, I know the post is deleted now)

- u/pocketwailord, u/excellentpantschoice, u/datacruncha, u/actualbadger, u/sinnU2s, u/lawfultots, u/RedPillInjester, for all the examples they sent, all quite distinct from one another which was really helpful

<summary>u/AElowsson discusses the proper way to present home staker yield</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1efl096/daily_general_discussion_july_30_2024/lfo5bbt/)

[Tweet](https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1818285735591419963) where I highlight how to present yield distributions for non-pooled stakers. Some webpages and researchers rely on things like the median across all validators over some minuscule time period, averaging these medians over time. This fails to capture the probabilistic outcome facing the solo staker. Half of the validators will never propose a block during the same day, yet half will still propose within a few months.  Order statistics are instead relevant on a per-validator basis over longer time.   
  
*To check if it is raining, do not extend your hand and measure the median number of fingers impacted by raindrops every millisecond. The result will always be zero; yet it might still rain.*

The figure shows how distributions vary with pool size after one year. This is a more appropriate way to communicate order statistics. The tiny vertical black line segment is the solo stakers that do not have a block proposal or sync-committee duty over a year, presented as the ‚Äúall-time median‚Äù on sites such as Rated. The real median outcome facing solo stakers after one year is indicated by a black arrow, fairly close already to the expected yield.

The context of this discussion is the modeling assumptions in the post on [maximum viable security (MVS)](https://ethresear.ch/t/maximum-viable-security-a-new-framing-for-ethereum-issuance/19992).  
  
The modeling and the same figure can also be found in my [latest response](https://ethresear.ch/t/maximum-viable-security-a-new-framing-for-ethereum-issuance/19992/5) to that post.

Ethereum came a long way:

When I joined prediction markets and decentralized social media were concepts people pointed at when discussing potential use cases of the network

Today both concepts are implemented (polymarket, Farcaster) and show how it all makes sense. The teams that implemented them were not the ones which people initially thought would but that‚Äôs the beauty of decentralization

Both of these are early and have lots of growth ahead but we‚Äôre at a stage where we‚Äôre beyond imagining with live apps in production. We‚Äôve came a long way so far

ETH is an asset I feel comfy holding for the next 20 years+

I can not say the same about any other crypto asset. The ones that are mostly VC hyped are the ones that get dumped at the end of the cycle so I would certainly not recommend to hold these for the long run if your objective is to take home profit

<summary>u/MerkleChainsaw asks about the realities of tokenization and u/pa7x1 explains how they think tokenization will work</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1egeu6r/daily_general_discussion_july_31_2024/lfsuo87/)

[u/MerkleChainsaw](https://reddit.com/u/MerkleChainsaw):

How would Blackrock (or anyone else) actually implement tokenization of real world assets?

They'd need to maintain some centralized control even if KYC whitelisting wasn't required, just to reverse transactions of lost or stolen coins. North Korea wouldn't actually get to be part owner in Lockheed Martin because they stole some shares and "code is law". That's not too big a deal because RWAs will always require trust in the issuer anyway, and Blackrock is of course more trustworthy and regulated than crypto startups like Celsius were.

I don't think Blackrock would be comfortable using existing L2s for the token smart contract. They wouldn't control the governance and any breaking changes could be catastrophic with billions (or trillions?) of dollars worth of assets at stake representing claims to real world things. I know technically this governance argument could apply to Ethereum itself, but I think Ethereum governance will always be more reliable since validators with ETH at stake are the ultimate approvers of any changes. L2s will either be centralized or have changes decided by cash grab governance tokens. If Blackrock or an industry consortium designed their own specialized and controlled L2 then wouldn't we lose most of the benefits of the openness of DeFi?

At some point it's just easier to just build an API with specifications for transferring ownership between accounts when a trade has happened. They could even have an address / signed transaction scheme similar to blockchains so that any exchange could instant settle a trade, but that would still just be tradfi.

I've sold my ETH, but the possibility of RWAs coming to Ethereum gives me some FOMO because the opportunity could be absolutely massive. I'm trying to visualize how it would actually work in a way that accrues value to ETH.

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

I suspect BlackRock, Nasdaq, etc... will run their own permissioned L2s. I.e. you cannot execute orders directly, you won't have the private keys and a wallet to create your orders directly. Your experience as a user might be exactly the same as it is today, through your broker app. These L2s will be the underlying infrastructure where the trades are executed.

What's the advantage for them? Running their trading on their systems already works and is likely cheaper in terms of infra, so why bother? The answer is composability. They will be all interconnected by Ethereum, acting as the infrastructure backbone for finance. Moving assets from one L2 to another is trivial, immediate, auditable, cryptographically secure and you know the assets are truly there. Finance works currently with D+1, D+2 settlement. During that 1 or 2 days, your assets are in the limbo. And that settlement is costly, in terms of resources and delays. Sprinkle these with a bit of zk magic, based rollups, pre-confirmations... and you will have global instant settlement.

For trivial stuff, like small trading, they give us the perception of immediate settlement. Your MSFT stock appears directly in your brokerage account when you click buy, but it's not really there yet. But for big money, you cannot really trust the money is there until it's settled. The financial world was on the brink of collapse during the 2008 crisis as nobody could trust anybody else's balance sheets.

So, during that little dip, I said to myself, Solana‚Äôs very likely going to outperform ETH because everyone‚Äôs retarded. 

I went to hit the buy button, but my body started convulsing and I threw up in my mouth. I physically could not do it. 

I bought more ETH instead.

If you're a Rocketpool operator and haven't yet, please initialise your voting power as described here: <https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-protocol-dao-governance-a3c3e92904e0>

If you don't care about participating in governance, you should still initialise your voting power and then delegate it to someone from the delegates listed here: <https://delegates.rocketpool.net/>

You can always override your delegate's decision on a particular vote if you desire. 

This setup just takes two minutes and ensures the on-chain voting system can fully launch soon (they're waiting for 50% initialised voting power).

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll needs some help brainstorming some flairs</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e7nt2y/daily_general_discussion_july_20_2024/le2sqzp/)

As per [a suggestion](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dnxzmo/daily_general_discussion_june_25_2024/la9fdas/) from u/stablecoin a few weeks ago (yes I'm slow to get onto things), us mods would like to put together a default list of flairs for users to choose from. Stablecoin suggested that this may help in discussions by providing context into the perspective through which someone is probably coming from when we are having discussions. For example, if you see a permabull flair, then maybe their hopium should be taken with a grain of salt or with a long timeframe in mind. Or, if someone has the developer or tradfi flair, then they may have some extra credibility when discussing those topics.

So, anyway, please help us brainstorm a list and we will get them on the default flair options!

Starting off, this is me borrowing from what u/stablecoin put:

- DeFi Power User

- Home Staker

- Value Extractor/Mercenary

- Trader

- SocialFi & NFTs Enthusiast

- Here for the societal revolution

Please brainstorm away! Cheers!

<summary>u/pa7x1 is out there fighting the good fight</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e8ely9/daily_general_discussion_july_21_2024/le7jj6c/)

I have continued the "educational battle"/"fight the misinformation campaign" on /r/investing. It's really amazing how poorly Bitcoiners understand their own investment.

<https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e7mbip/for_the_same_amount_of_money_is_it_better_to_buy/le7g2rg/>

Here I explain that Bitcoin is, in fact, not unstoppable. On the contrary, it will stop itself in the year 2038 due to a time overflow bug. The fix to this requires a hard fork. The issue is that they have pinned themselves into a corner by making hard forks taboo. A hard fork is also what you need to change the issuance schedule of Bitcoin, if you fix this bug it would be implicit recognition that 21M is not a feature of Bitcoin code, but of social consensus and it can be changed through social consensus.

When you have been in this space long enough you understand that people that approached Bitcoin over a decade ago through an ideological lens, are not Bitcoiners anymore. Those that approached this space with the intent of removing the monopoly of money from the State and giving back the rights that governments had been eroding for decades from their citizens, have left and moved on to Ethereum. And likely this will remain the case for as long as Ethereum keeps fighting for those principles through math. 

Ethereum's development resembles much more the discovery process of science, Ethereum is not the way it is because of capricious choices. It's the way it is because the constraints you have to work with are so binding that it cannot be in many other ways if you want to maintain security, decentralization, credible neutrality, censorship resistance, scale to the serve the world needs, inherit those security properties on the upper layers of the financial world, etc...

These properties alone have lead us to PoS, EIP-1559 burn mechanism, the roll-up centric roadmap. These choices are a result of these constraints, and there really is very little leeway around it, as far as we know.

In much the same way Einstein's theory of relativity is not the way it is because scientists decided those were the equations. It's the simplest solution that respects relativity, respects the equivalence principle, reproduces Newton's gravity in the low energy/low speed regimes, reproduces the gravitational curvature of light, the precession of perihelion of Mercury. Those requirements are binding enough to give you Einstein's field equations. 

There are some higher order details that can be tuned in both General Relativity and Ethereum, but the core principles become rather constrained to the point there is a single theory that meets all those in the case of General Relativity. It's unclear to me yet if the case is as constraining for Ethereum, but we are progressively getting there as we understand better this problem space.

<summary>u/HSuke teases their big post about blockchain resilience</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e8ely9/daily_general_discussion_july_21_2024/le96j60/)

I made a post about blockchain resilience to bugs in a separate thread between PoW and PoS:

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e8a62w/pow_vs_pos_and_safety_vs_resilience_why_ethereum/>

It's quite long, so here are just the Preface and Summary sections. Use the link above if you want to read the rest of it.

---------------------

##**Preface**

I originally wrote this piece after [Ethereum lost finality](https://www.theblock.co/post/230723/ethereum-beacon-chain-patches-finality-issues) back in May 2023 twice when both the Prysm and Teku minority clients encountered bugs. Around then, Vitalik also dicussed the possibility and concerns for **staking bailouts** in his ["Don't overload Ethereum's consensus" article](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html) if a catatrophic bug were to happen.

I'm updating and reposting this in light of 2 recent events:

1. Vitalik's [Keynote speech at EthCC 7](https://ethcc.io/archive/a-keynote-with-Vitalik-Buterin) where he warns that Ethereum protocol design needs to be careful of other vulnerabilities besides just the typical 33/50/67% consensus-level attacks. It's a great, humble lecture from Vitalik, and I highly recommend watching it if you haven't already done so.
1. Geth client developer Marius van der Wijden [making it very clear](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ethereum-all-core-developers-execution-call-192/) that he [wasn't ready for including EOF in the Pectra update](https://mariusvanderwijden.github.io/blog/2024/07/12/EOF/)

**This is a reminder that there is a reason Ethereum updates are slow and methodical** and use multiple testnets.

It only takes one unlucky bug to cause catastrophic damage to the blockchain and cause a **mass-slashing event** where the majority of stakers will lose their Ether. We got lucky back in 2023 because the bugs were in minority clients and it only halted finality. A bug affecting the majority of clients might not happen now or even in the next decade, but there may be one day where another catastrophic event as damaging as [the 2016 DAO hack](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/coindesk-turns-10-how-the-dao-hack-changed-ethereum-and-crypto/) causes the chain to split again.

---------------------

##**Summary**

> Historically, successful PoW attacks have been numerous, but successful PoS attacks are virtually non-existent.

History has proven that **PoS** consensus is a more secure alternative to **PoW** consensus against Sybil attacks like the 51% attack. However, this is at the cost of PoS being less **resilient** than PoW for disaster recovery. This is because PoW by design allows for miners to re-attack/reorg the blockchain to revert mistakes.

While client bugs are exceptionally rare, they do occur, and most PoS blockchains have no on-chain method to revert past finality. It's important to avoid reorgs in the first place because any transations that finalize off-chain through DEXs, bridges, and CEXs are often irreversible even after the blockchain is reverted.

* **Security** is the ability to protect against malicious attackers
* **Resilience** is the ability to restore the chain after an attack or catastrophic bug

Similar to the Blockchain Trilemma where there are trade offs between Security, Decentralization, and Scalability--**Resilience is also a tradeoff of Security**.

Even the 2 biggest blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum (when it was still using PoW), have encountered 51% attacks. Bitcoin (in 2010 and 2013) and PoW Ethereum (in 2016 and 2016) had both been successfully 51% attacked twice each in order to fix catastrophic bugs and issues. It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to accomplish this in reasonable time under PoS Ethereum and most other decentralized PoS blockchains today.

Past finality, it usually requires a DAO-hack like chain split or bailout to undo a catastrophe: i.e. through Layer 0 community consensus and off-chain governance.

<summary>u/betterluckythengood has a warning for ETHE holders and u/Brent_the_Adventurer educates us on how ETHE works</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e960uq/daily_general_discussion_july_22_2024/ledqmoy/)

[u/betterluckythengood](https://reddit.com/u/betterluckythengood):

ETHE rotating FYI

The NAV price of an ETF corrects at the end of the day, but can deviate a bit during trading hours because of supply and demand forces.

Nobody likes the high ETHE fees, but it might be worth waiting a couple weeks before switching to a different ETH ETF as the ETHE sell pressure early on may push it below NAV during the day. If you sell ETHE and immediately buy another ETH ETF, you may end up with slightly less ETH value than you had before.

This was evidenced during the first week or so for GBTC when the BTC ETFs started trading. Immense sell pressure during the day took GBTC below NAV and strong buy pressure for the popular BTC ETFs may even have pushed them slightly above NAV during trading hours. Those that quickly sold GBTC and immediately rebought another BTC ETF early on often lost a bit of their value.

Best of luck, may the ETH ETFs help take us to the promised land.

[u/Brent_the_Adventurer](https://reddit.com/u/Brent_the_Adventurer):

Here's my understanding of how it works. Let's say you have 1000 shares of ETHE purchases at $20 each, and these shares represent 10 ETH for easy math.

Since settlement for shares is T+1 and the "Record Date" is today the 18th at 4:00 PM, any shares purchased before today will be included in the spin off to the mini ETF. Now if you fall in that camp this is what will happen.

You still own 1000 shares of ETHE but they only represent 9 ETH now, so your cost basis on those ETHE shares is now $18/share. You will also own (on a later date to be determined, the "Distribution Date") 1000 shares of mini-ETH representing 1 ETH, or a $2/share cost basis.

If you sell your ETHE shares today or beyond, you will still receive your 1000 shares of mini-ETH because of the T+1 settlement. This also means that if you buy ETHE today, you will *not* receive any mini-ETH shares.

So, the 10% "discount" is not really a discount and is pricing in the new NAV, meaning it's basically at fair value.

<summary>u/Dangerous_Coast just had a massive wake up call</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e960uq/daily_general_discussion_july_22_2024/leerbxm/)

I'm a longtime follower who primarily lurks the daily since finding Ethereum in 2017. I want to share my story about my massive wake-up call on the importance of account security and backups after becoming complacent due to my time spent in the space. You never think it could happen to you...

For 3 weeks, I believed I lost access to all my crypto savings and cold wallet / validator withdrawal address. I travel extended periods for work and have some large life expenses right now, so I brought my Ledger with me. Not the first time I've travelled with it, but it is the first time I had a bag stolen. I was frustrated but knew I had my seed phrase stored and could recover when I returned home.

I've recently bought my first house and moved in with my partner. In the confusion of moving 2 apartments into one, my recovery sheet and other old 2017 financial records were missing. I was feeling pretty despondent knowing that my carelessness and non-urgency about prepping for disaster recovery were starting to bite me in the ass. I fully believed that I lost access to my cold savings and minipools.

It's not like I couldn't afford my mortgage, but all hope I had for early financial independence were gone. That planned 2 year maternity leave, funded by ETH, for my pregnant partner wasn't financially feasible anymore.

I did eventually find my ratty old college notebook with my Ledger seed phrase scrawled in the margins from 2017 when I originally set it up. The euphoria and relief on that day was enormous. I got lucky, I restored everything and have it all secured now. But I feel the need to share my near miss with others so that no one has to feel that rollercoaster of emotion going forward. I made plenty of mistakes to put myself in this situation.

My advice learnt from this; Setup an annual recovery method testing reminder. If you have a trusted partner, teach them about how to access things in the event you pass away. Keep your position records up to date, it also makes me less inclined to toss ETH into various flavours of the month that inevitably crash and burn. Pull the trigger on that Eversteel and set it up properly.

I made my mistakes but got lucky. Dont let complacency and one moment of misfortune ruin multiple years of making the right decision to invest and hold Ether.

<summary>u/decibels42 thinks that the clock is now ticking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e9zgce/daily_general_discussion_july_23_2024/lel5o9p/)

The clock started today my friends.

The trifecta will burn from today forward of: (1) 1559/merge tokenomics, (2) growth of L2 usage/competition and the ETH ecosystem and dapp creation (enabled by cheaper transaction fees and a growing developer base), and now (3) tradfi and retirement account access (ETFs).

Cry all you'd like about the ratio bleed until now. I remember 2019 well. We bled until the eventual lows in the fall even through the optimism and fake breakout of BTC and crypto in the first half of the year. If you were there, you know how things went. If you weren't, open the charts.

I shook my head often over this year as I see ratio complainers or people impatient for a golden bull. There's never been a crypto bull run in history short of a 3+ year bear market. I'm not saying it can't happen from here forward, but until it happens, we should exercise caution with our impatience.

I'm one of the people who thought we'd ratio gain throughout this year. I was wrong. But, zooming out, and overall, the ratio has held stronger and better than anyone could have imagined in 2018-20. Now the games begin as we have the banks and tradfi financially incentivized to explain the benefits of ETH, as the ecosystem itself continues to improve itself and expand/grow. Make no mistake, this will still take some time to percolate. Enjoy the ride.

Happy ETF launch day. Our first future bull with all the pieces align. It only took 7 Lubins and I still pray nightly for Vitalik to not turn off the master node.

<summary>u/Revanchist1 poses an important bigger picture question</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e9zgce/daily_general_discussion_july_23_2024/lejxx4k/)

Here's something that's been bothering me for years. As Ethereum continues to gain adoption, I cannot see a future where Ethereum is left to be a neutral settlement layer without having it's fair share of battles. 

How will large financial institutions excercise control over Ethereum? As centralized stablecoins increase in size and gain adoption, and large TradFi institutions accumulate and stake ETH, the economic and social power will shift towards them and away from retail. 

How does the community ensure development of Ethereum doesn't get co-opted by these institutions?

Centralized Stablecoin liquidity and support is a huge social attack vector. While I doubt the ETH devs and researchers will care about that, the social pressure from the community may become to loud to ignore if coordinated propaganda is used. 

Large TradFi institutions may also begin funding client teams or even create new clients themselves. I've already seen questions of conflict of interests raised proposed ERCs and upgrade proposals. I can only imagine what would happen as larger financial players enter the scene. 

Creating troll armies are easier than ever and can quickly flood social forums with coordinated messaging. These social attacks would be the most impactful as they would cause the most confusion in discussions. The discord from bad faith actors could put a stranglehold on development and research.

Anyway, that's my half baked doom and gloom. Haven't been posting here since reddit got rid of the 3rd party mobile apps but I'm trying to get used to the Reddit app now.

[u/VbV3uBCxQB9b](https://reddit.com/u/VbV3uBCxQB9b):

Guys, I'm kinda freaking out, if someone could help me understand what's happening, I'd be very thankful.

I have a Compound position that I intend(ed?) to leave running for the long term, managed with Defi Saver, on the Base Layer 2 network. It supplies cbETH and boosts by borrowing ETH, buying more cbETH and supplying that etc.

So I wake up today to find that my APY, which last I saw was 15%, is now at -40%. This caught me by surprise, as you can imagine. The reason has to do with the price of borrowing ETH, which went up from 1% to around 8%.

I had a CDP position back when it blew up, in 2019 if I'm not mistaken, so at first I thought some kind of problem like that, but I come here and no one seems to be talking about anything related to this, no crisis, no liquidity problem on ETH or anything like that.

So can anyone shed some light on this? Should I liquidate this position right now, or is this a temporary thing that will normalize soon?

[u/nikola_j](https://reddit.com/u/nikola_j):

Hey, good ser, so a person from defi saver here, as u/TheCryptosAndBloods mentioned below (thanks for the tag once again!).

These kinds of spikes in borrowing rates are common in all pool-based money market protocols (i.e. protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue) where rates constantly change based on current overall utilisation of the used pool.

I wouldn't panic about it and would rather wait it out for a day or two to see how the rates change further. Usually there'll be new (ETH) depositors quickly that have noticed the high available APY for supplying, which is usually considered one of the lower risk opportunities for yield on ETH when it comes to tier 1 protocols such as these.

Hope that clarifies things?

And p.s. the net APY specifically is calculated based on your position balance and how it would change in one year from now based on current supply & borrow APYs, if that wasn't clear.

I'm kind of fed up with all the negativity around #Ethereum and Rollups when the whole ecosystem is shipping out of its mind right now. People who look at what we have now and still think Ethereum should have scaled L1 first... are you all out of your minds?

Let me tell you what approximately would have happened if we scaled L1:
- Maybe 50-100 TPS now on L1... wow... I'm sure all the skeptics would have jumped on Ethereum L1 and done all their stuff there.
- Rollups that were previously aligned with Ethereum would most definitely have chosen alternative solutions for DA to meaningfully scale (which is now possible using Ethereum as DA).
- We would not have hundreds of Rollup teams contributing back to the Ethereum and EVM ecosystem.
- Minimal marketing for the Ethereum ecosystem... L2s would just end up doing their own thing, because why should they stay if Ethereum chose to abandon them in the most critical of times?

Ethereum would have essentially pushed the most valuable allies away despite funding a lot of the ZK and rollup research in the past (even 5+ years ago).

We now get so much more back from L2s, and with PeerDAS and full proto-Danksharding on the horizon, there will be no argument left for why those rollups should even think about doing their "own thing" or choosing a different DA. I mean, look at what is happening with $TIA... Ethereum is basically eating their lunch right now.

We now have:
- Multiple Consensus and Execution Client Teams making Ethereum the most decentralized public Blockchain to ever exist by a large margin. AFAIK no other Blockchain even has 2 meaningfully adopted clients... Ethereum has 7 clients with >10% distribution, that's just incredible if you think about it
- Multiple Rollups that are among the most active chains right now
- Both @base
 and @arbitrum
 breaking their own records every few days, attracting billions in TVL and millions of users, shipping out of their minds, having meaningful traction, and a growing app ecosystem
- Multiple more theme-focused, Ethereum-aligned L2s like e.g. @Immutable
 onboarding hundreds of game studios and eventually millions of gamers
- Account abstraction wallets that wouldn't have been easily possible on L1 (at least not so soon) via @Immutable
 passport or @infinex_app
 offering sponsored meta transactions
- The cheapest L1 gas fees we‚Äôve probably ever had. Introducing blobs with EIP-4844 made room for more meaningful transactions. At peak times, L2s made up for up to ~30% of the Ethereum blockspace (this most likely still is temporary and also bought us some time to give L1 some love)

I have no doubt in my mind that what Ethereum did has led to the absolute best outcome for the protocol we could have hoped for in the last 3-4 years. 
Of course, L1 could have used some love, but that critique is on such a high level that it feels like we're just coping because the price is not catching up with fundamentals.

If you had told me where Ethereum would be right now 3-4 years ago, I couldn't have imagined a more solid position for it to be in.

Now we can discuss what should be next and that going further down the Rollup path might be a bad idea, or that we should focus on fixing fragmentation, etc., and that delaying this and that in favor of some L1 love is a good idea. I'm totally into that, but please stop with all the coping when we basically just shipped an upgrade that gave @base
 and other Rollups <1 cent fees ~4 months ago...

\#Ethereum and its whole ecosystem is still winning, and nothing can stop it from winning even more, as the whole behemoth that is thousands of ecosystem teams all shipping in parallel is just getting started.

I know I've been woefully non-reporting my ARB delegate updates the last month, but for those who want to check voting records I did make a reporting thread a few months ago if people want to follow for the links to all my votes + rationale

[https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/bob-rossi-delegate-communication-thread/23653](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/bob-rossi-delegate-communication-thread/23653)

Beyond basic duties, notable projects I've taken on recently. Which if people want to discuss / voice opinions about I'm all ears.

- I'm on the interim oversight committee for the ARB gaming project that passed. There is a vote for the actual oversight committee soon, but they wanted some of the prominent delegates on there for between period where the program was approved but no oversight board voted on. I was partially chosen since I was no voter, and they wanted representation from dissenting opinions. I am not running for full time council, if anyone was wondering. 
- I'm also (hopefully) going to be on another oversight committee for a separate project relating more to theory-crafting how to more efficiently run the DAO. A little up in the air at the moment, but have said I'd do it if it goes forward. 
- HOP related, but they are starting a grant committee. Which I've applied for... I do need to get voted in but if elected I'll for sure be reaching out to people here. It is small given the project, but might be a good thing for those who are looking for that type of funding.

Also don't forget ARB is still running the LTIPP incentives so there are likely some good projects out there to earn some extra APY, or simply getting rewarded for using. Here is the list of them all if your curious - [Powerhouse Connect (arbgrants.com)](https://www.arbgrants.com/d/Arbitrum%20LTIPP/Grants%20G-L). May I suggest checking out the "H" section as well, although forgive me as i've been busy and a little behind on what I need to update (I will be this weekend)

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra discusses Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins and moneyness</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dvpzvb/daily_general_discussion_july_5_2024/lbs70hi/)

**On Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Altcoins**

Many people might have noticed that I'm one of the most vehemently anti-Bitcoin people in here, and also very often diss Altcoins. They are not wrong. So I will attempt to explain why there's a world of difference between a Bitcoin Maxi and an Ethereum Maxi.

It's strange, because I was really, *really* late on Ethereum, and *really* into Bitcoin. Not only was I completely oblivious to its existence until 2017, I even initially dismissed it as another altcoin that's going to zero. Up until 2018, I was essentially a Bitcoin Maxi. After a few short months or reading up on several coins, getting heavily rekt in the 2018 crash betting on NANO, and educating myself about crypto, I had completely converter to Ethereum. And I left Bitcoin completely behind.

Why is that?

Gresham's law states that bad money drives out good money. The good money that is driven out is hoarded, so if it is scarce, it increases in value. Many people understand this as "Crypto will always outperform Fiat because it's better money". But there's another angle to it. In my opinion, this applies even more strongly **within** the highly liquid and interconnected crypto ecosystem, sucking value out of *every single Altcoin* and giving it to the leading crypto, which is the one that has the most "moneyness". During this process, the leading crypto builds even more status as *money*, and altcoins are dismissed as bad investments at best or scams at worst.

Every cycle, once the speculative frenzy dies out, and it eventually does, every single crypto ends up being valued exactly as a company stock: according to the current and future profits it can bring to the holder, taking into account the potential for its future growth. For most altcoins, that means following an asymptote to zero, since they don't really have any profits.

Why has Ether escaped this fate for a couple of cycles? After all, Ethereum is constantly regarded as one of the *most undervalued altcoins* not just by Ethereans (of course we would think that) but even by neutral Altcoiners. "Ethereum can only dump after good news" is a meme in most crypto subreddits. But somehow Etherum persists. In my opinion, this can be explained because even though in the minds of the majority Ethereum is still an altcoin, it's again valued as a stock: according to its profits. It's seen as undervalued precicely because a lot of speculative value has evaporated due to it having been around for a couple of cycles. The fact that it's not only profitable, but the **only** profitable altcoin (OK there's also BNB and maybe TRON with some light profits) is the reason it is not following every single other crypto to oblivion.

Every single crypto... except one. The one that in the minds of the majority is the best money. The one that every single cycle, without fail, will be the safe haven that's not going to zero, because it has a hard support of rabid acolytes that see it as the best money on Earth. Bitcoin.

So, sometime during Ethereum's development, I think some very smart people realized that this is the game. As a result, Ether is the only crypto that has worked and fought to be seen as a better money. Ultrasound money might or might not be the best attempt to communicate that to the general public, but in my opinion is very apt.

Ethereum is an absolutely unique altcoin in this regard, because from the moment it was created, its scope and capabilities exceeded Bitcoin's by such a huge margin, that it could legitimately claim to be the money of the crypto ecosystem, superseding Bitcoin.

Many of you think there's room for both BTC and ETH on the ecosystem. Sure, there's room for both, if BTC is the money and ETH keeps being valued as a stock. If BTC reaches $1M and ETH reaches $12K.

But if you want a $150K Ether, then you just can't have Bitcoin being seen as the better money. And if Bitcoin ceases to be seen as the better money, it's not even going to be in the top 20 on Coinmarketcap.

So, when you people try to be moderate with Bitcoin Maxis in order to drive a civilized discussion you miss the fact that this is impossible. The smart Maxis *know* that Ethereum is a **mortal threat** to Bitcoin. There's no civilized discussion that can happen in light of this fact. They can only dismiss Ethereum as the worst shitcoin, because acknowledging it might lead some moderate Bitcoiners or people that are on the fence to jump ship. And when you've build a personal brand and an entire livelihood on Bitcoin being the best money, you might not be able to do the same. But even though you might know that Ethereum is objectively better money, you do have some very strong weapons to fight back. The early Bitcoiners are some of the wealthiest people in the ecosystem. They can help launch "Ethereum killers" and pump them 2000%. They can spread FUD. They can go on podcasts and shit on Ethereum non-stop. The vitriol and dismissal I've seen against Ethereum from smug Maxis is not even *close* to other altcoins.

Because they realize the fact that you can have many cryptocurrencies and a thriving ecosystem, but not all of them can be money. Crypto needs a King. And so far,  this Maxi strategy is working, because it keeps Bitcoin's network effect intact and damages Ethereum's. And the network effect is the **only** thing that gives money its value.

So, I am an Ethereum Maxi. But here's the difference: I am not an Ethereum Maxi because I can't move to Bitcoin. I am late enough to be neither rich or have buit a business around Ethereum. I'm a Maxi because Ethereum is just better. So, unlike Bitcoin Maxis, I don't really have to resort to arguments found at the lowest levels of Graham's argument pyramid. I can make intelligent points, refute Maxi's stupid arguments, *and* be an Ethereum Maxi myself. It's easy, because there not even a conflict. The world benefits *along* with my bags, which I think is pretty rare.

So be a Maxi, because what Ethereum is trying to do is neither easy nor certain.  We are coming for the King, and we *definitely* best not miss.

ACDE 191 Recap posted by ralexstokes in the ETH R&D Discord:

ACDE 191 Recap

Started with Pectra updates  

* Clients moving ahead with devnet-1 implementations  
* Waiting for a greater number of clients to be ready before we launch devnet-1, but expect to be there in the next week or two  
* Got an [update on 7702 progress](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8677) that will likely go into devnet-2; please take a look as the intention is to merge in the next week  

\*\*   Note: devnet-1 will reflect the current spec of EIP-7702  

Then turned to discuss EIP-7212 

* There‚Äôs support for the feature as it brings a lot of nice UX improvements around key/wallet management with a widely supported cryptographic curve  
* We discussed the point around formal inclusion in Pectra, but will wait till the next ACDE to make that decision. While the EIP in isolation brings a nice set of features, it needs to be weighed against the already large scope of Pectra  
* There are a few minor things to address around the EIP itself, including mirroring the precompile address across L2 deployments and L1. These will be resolved over the next two weeks to tee us up for an inclusion discussion on the next call

Next, [we discussed a proposal to add events](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7002-execution-layer-triggerable-exits/14195/13) to the predeploy system contracts for cross-layer communication with EIP-7002 and EIP-7251. Consensus was that this change makes sense and the corresponding contracts will be updated.

Then, we had a call to [deactivate EIP-158](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8712) to simplify the effects of deploying EIP-7702 and the Verkle migration. In light of the latest updates to 7702 we no longer need this proposal and decided to ignore it.  

And to wrap the call, we had a discussion around making progress on other protocol improvements like history expiry and changes to the blob mempool to streamline usage of blobs by users like rollups. We jumped across various concerns here so check the call for the details. In short, there was a call for more regular updates on EIP-4444‚Äôs progress, and a call out to various things both rollups and clients can do to more intelligently handle the pipeline from blob producer to blob inclusion on-chain.  

Reminder: Goerli has been deprecated and so clients will (or have already!) dropped support for this testnet.

200 sustained tp/s and still only 1-2gwei gas fees

<https://imgur.com/a/05zT8vK>

we are severely over capacity 

the infrastructure currently in place is able to support so many more users

it will destroy all shred of doubt whether or not blockchain can scale to support the entire world as it was intended to

the next bull run will be like nothing we've ever seen

and the etfs going live might just be the linchpin

cba for the flippening

I want to see the great supply crunch as the economic beast awakens and is firing on all cylinders

on to the next cycle of new tech --> new users get interested --> eventually current tech limits are hit --> users face frustration and lose interest --> technology improves and readies itself for round of user adoption --> repeat

It's safe to say we've at least x100 our user capacity since the last big bull run

now let the users come back and see what happens

I'll never forget this time I was waiting at a bar for my btc transactions to be confirmed, had to wait over an hour to get the needed confirmations, PoW RNG be damned. The UX experience is crazy much better compared to back then.

At some point, we're all going to realize this technology isn't going anywhere and is not a ponzi, or at least, not any more than all other fiat is.

Except that this is money by the people, for the people.

How did you find your way to ethfinance?


My story was that I was a semi active user on r/silverbugs and r/pmsforsale. Around 2016 I noticed more people accepting "crypto" as payment. I remember someone selling about $50 worth of silver for something like 10 eth. Once the boom of winter 2017 happened a few friends brought crypto back up and we all bought the top (btc, eth, ltc). That's when I found ethtrader and became a lurker. Once ethtrader dissolved into whatever the hell it is now, I followed dcinvestor, jt and a few others here where I still am someone active.

[u/baggygravy](https://reddit.com/u/baggygravy):

Adding to the staking posts below (or above if you're in Australia) - I have also been onboarded to NodeSet recently, and my first testnet validator went live today and is chugging away just fine. The Gravita project looks good, but Constellation is the one I have my eye on - basically staking for and on behalf of others via RocketPool, taking a cut of their earnings for running the node - hopefully coming by next year.

I've also just signed up for the Stakers Union, and have been having fun with Heroglyphs the last few weeks, and there is Etherguardians coming up soon too.

This has been the best and most interesting few months for a home staker like me, at least since the excitement of Genesis - it's great to see community efforts to encourage and reward home staking that are supported by the ecosystem as a whole . A big shout out to u/superphiz for his ceaseless efforts, as always.

[u/TheHansGruber](https://reddit.com/u/TheHansGruber):

A few months ago I was onboarded as an operator with nodeset. I have been running a few thousand genesis validators alongside a dozen or so other techno-acolytes that coalesced in the rocketpool discord, so I threw my hat in as I thought I had some qualifying experience in and around the college ball level. 

Well, the first validator I have spun up using their hyperdrive software stack goes live in about an hour on holesky, and I am looking forward to spinning many up on mainnet when the opprotunity to do so presents itself. The software stack is straight forward and does require some registering on their website to finish things off, but overall the process was painless and left me feeling good about the whole thing.

There already are some lucky operators attesting on mainnet permitting the existence of Gravita Protocol's LST, gravETH which is a part of the Stakewise Vault ecosystem. I haven't kept up with stakewise recently, but I did lose some eth trading their token like, a year or more ago. Not a knock on them or anything, I am just a bad trader.

Gravita does have a points program running (they call them marks) and while I don't know *too* much about their roadmap, I do think the space/time dilation art style and theme is kickass. It's hard to launch  an LST in this already crowded market, but I wanna take a minute to remind everyone that every additional LST out there helps decentralize the entire network a little bit more. Which is overall good.

Diva/Nektar staking development is coming along, as is Lido's CSM which is also currently operating on testnet with some early permissioned adopters. I am on this list, but have not yet gotten around to spinning up another VM. Will try to find the time today or tomorrow but several *big-ass* tree limbs came down in a storm yesterday that I have to bust out the chainsaw to deal with unexpectedly...and as much as I enjoy a hard-days work outdoors...I am doing all of this keyboard clacking and button clicking in an attempt to not *have* to do as much manual labor.

It's 3am and Gary hasn't been home yet. He's sweating, gently waxing his red stapler for the last time over a bottle of Jim Beam. Elizabeth Warren said he could only keep the stapler, which he stole from the strange man in the basement, if he destroyed crypto. After glossing over the TPS reports on his desk in a bourbon-daze, Gary picks up the phone. A smokey Eldritch voice answers.

"It's Gary," Gary says, wondering if any other color of stapler will ever fill the vessel of his soul like the red one has. "Drop the investigations against ETH."

He pours himself and his red stapler a snifter of whisky; then he simply weeps.

<summary>u/suburbiton explains why the long tail of assets hasn't pumped yet</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dfiz4n/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2024/l8jlorf/)

From twitter:

People don‚Äôt understand why markets pump. How the flow of money works. The first tier of money goes to top tier stocks and government bonds. Then to high level private equity private credit etc .. Then it flows to higher risk bonds. Then to higher risk stocks‚Ä¶to top tier corporate bonds. Lower tier private equity‚Ä¶ alternative investments like bitcoin. Then‚Ä¶.

After everything is filled ‚Ä¶ money flows to high high risk like Altcoins etc and alt stocks penny stocks what not. The reason no Altcoin or even Ethereum has hit a new ATH or broken or even come close to breaking 2021 highs is because there isn‚Äôt money to make it that far. 

You need liquidity events in market to reach the far depths of risk. That far depth gets touched once everything else is full. Similar to money flowing bucket to bucket. The liquidity event that happened in 2008 and 2020 has not happened yet. Liquidity events are lower rates, or stimulus. Without it you cannot have high risk products pump. In January 2024 market was pricing in a huge liquidity event for 2024. 7 rate cuts. This is why everything hit 3 year highs. This along with bitcoin etf got us a new high on BTC and saw many alts climb several 500-1000% from 2022 lows. That liquidity event never materialized. We went from 7 cuts, to 3 cuts to a shock 1 cut now for 2024. The only way for market to go back up to all time highs accross the board is for liquidity event. Unfortunately if we get a shock event like Covid , or something else black swan that forces the Fed to cut rates quicker or a hard recession it‚Äôs usually too late. Market will crash ahead of it. That crash you buy and ride it back up into the liquidity event. 

Fed has decided they don‚Äôt want to cut aggressively. They going to cut in December this year and then next year. This will possibly result in a recession or maybe we just see soft landing and gradual cuts over next 2/3 years. I. That scenario market will slowly grind up over next 2-3 years and we might see altcoin highs during that time. Market is forward looking so it can always change. If we approach a recession worse than expected and say u employment ticks up to 5% then Fed will cut but by then we will see a big dump in market on recession or stagflation fears. 

It‚Äôs always a tough battle. The last 15 years of bull markets were on the back of liquidity events. This is the first time we have no stimulus. It‚Äôs a diff ball game. It‚Äôs a much tougher grind market for high risk assets in such scenario. That‚Äôs why all money is flowing to easy tech stocks that are giving better returns than crypto. Nobody wants to risk anything because there is no liquidity event. Ofcourse things can change but that‚Äôs the state of the market.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade looks at the difference in usage between Ethereum and Solana</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dfiz4n/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2024/l8kpagn/)

Remember that Solana chain everyone was so worried about a couple of months ago?

[Solana currently has a 4.24% TVL market share over defi](https://defillama.com/chains). Ethereum has a 60.8% market share. Include L2s and it's closing on 70%. Include EVM chains and sidechains and it's over 90%.

A part of me used to wish for eth to remain king on all fronts, including memecoins. 

My worst case scenario used to be *"even if everything fails, there'll still be demand for Ethereum to be the internet's casino, which will require eth for gas (more demand) and this usage will burn eth (less supply). So even in the worst case, price goes up over time".* 

But memecoins have migrated to Solana. Is it a bad thing? Well, not anymore.

Given the recent surge of L2s, the tx cost drops, the ETF, and the institutional demand for tokenisation, the worst case scenario is far better than it used to be. The complete vision seems to be happening, green and scalable. Ethereum becoming the world's settlement layer isn't a pipe dream anymore, it's becoming a realistic scenario. 

Today solana is alleviating Ethereum from scam, grifters, and hopefully regulator attention. It's taking the garbage that didn't require decentralization to function out of our ecosystem. 

Ethereum is taking everything else.

In case you didn't see it yesterday:

- The [Wall Street Journal figured out](https://x.com/reptar258/status/1801644699188351236) that stable coins help the american dollar to stay relevant (because everyone in any country can/do hold and use USDC or USDT) and provide the american state with buyers for their debt (indirectly, in the sense that Circle and Tether convert the USDs of their customers into bonds).
Guess which blockchain hosts 70% of the TVL of stablecoins?
- [BlackRock reiterated](https://x.com/matthew_sigel/status/1801342560977190937) that public blockchains are more secure and offer more opportunities than the private ones.
- A commissioner of [the SEC stated](https://x.com/BSCNews/status/1801626710380556328) that tokenisation is the future of financial markets.
- [ETH ETFs candidates informed journalists](https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1801725292404261308) that the SEC gave them feedback on their S-1 forms and the feedback is light, and asked them to update them within a week.

Meanwhile, information sources do business as usual: Coindesk, Cointelegraph and The Block ignore Ethereum-related news or turn them into "blockchain news",
Crypto Twitter and YouTube shill the shaky and declining Solana, BTC cultists and Solana moonboys repeat outdated propaganda against Ethereum over and over.

Why? Because they know. They are worried.

<summary>u/696_eth reflects on the ZKSync airdrop from a farmer's perspective</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dh06hm/daily_general_discussion_june_16_2024/l8u6eh4/)

Farmer's POV: $ZK takeaways

My personal insights and experience from farming $ZK airdrop.

‚Ä¢ Variety of strategies.

It really paid off using different strategies and although medium and small wallets basically got nothing, it was a good bet to try it out. Focusing on more than 1 big quality account was really smart and that's one of my main takeaways: have 5ish big juicy legit farmor accounts with a deeply rich history and previous qualifications and go at it. It also allows for easier and more pleasant farming because it's not that tedious to repeat.

‚Ä¢ Giving up small sybilling accounts.

ZKsync had 9M+ wallets and only ~696k qualified. It makes no sense to continue using low-value and quality wallets while spending one's time and energy. Farmers are not going away, thus you'd still need to stand out in the sea of hopeful airdrop chasers.

‚Ä¢ Farming can be ze wei - great risk/reward.

Airdrop farming can be profitable due to great R/R. You have a capped downside of how much money you will burn on gas fees, NFTs, and what not and you have quite an unlimited upside. Yes, zksync had a cap at 100k points but that would have been more than enough to guarantee an insane upside. 

‚Ä¢ Sybilling is a must.

Due to the upside being capped sometimes, we have to hedge ourselves or, like in the case with $eigen, lower value accounts are rewarded for being too low of a value lol. For those reasons, it's important not to whale projects unless there's a transparent structure of unlimited upside that aims clearly to not forego whales.

‚Ä¢ Overview.

I've heard and been told that it's too late to start farming yada yada but a decent chunk of $zk considering that I started late with no prior knowledge is a great accomplishment. Airdrop farming was and still is one of the most lucrative ways to gain the edge. However, I would argue that the edge lies in whaling some metrics or in the ability to access those resources to pump up your stats, and lesser accounts without that capital are unable to compete, therefore missing out on the great R/R play which in turn makes it worthwhile for lower value portfolios. Time and effort is no longer enough not just to outcompete but to even have a decent chunk of making it. 

‚Ä¢ $ZK price speculation.

At current premarket prices of $0.3-0.35ish, it would open at $7ish bn FDV given the 21bn of the total supply. To me, that would be a hold. As always I expect a dump at the open but being realistic even if I am not that skillful to be one of the first to dump, I won't be able to buy back lower. Historically, it has also been true to wait for a pump within days or a week, sometimes up to 16ish days or in rare cases for up to 1.5 months. With those things in mind, I can see a dump, a post-dump pump and I'm personally hoping for a cope pump - you know, that type of pump that TIA had. Ideally, I'd get ~$0.7ish+ and exit.

What are your takeaways?

<summary>u/benido2030 shares our ZKSync delegates while u/_WebOfTrust discusses his delegation experience</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dh06hm/daily_general_discussion_june_16_2024/l8vple4/)

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

I just played around with the zksync dao tool / delegation portal and the search is... not optimal. I wanted to add an ENS after not having one when setting up the profile and I did, but you can't find my or any profile via ENS. I think starknet used the same tool (Tally) as well I thought it didn't work because starknet has different addresses. You also can't search for usernames, it seems to be not working by default. 

So a quick summary for tomorrow in case you're not dumping on day1: 

- u/haurog: [https://vote.zknation.io/dao/delegate/haurog.eth](https://vote.zknation.io/dao/delegate/haurog.eth) or copy paste this address: 0x1c0AcCc24e1549125b5b3c14D999D3a496Afbdb1

I guess searching for the address is the easiest since I expect claiming and delegating to be one process. You probably can skip delegating and then go to the profile and delegate manually, but doing it in the claiming process is more comfy... 

  
I'll repost tomorrow morning as well!

[u/_WebOfTrust](https://reddit.com/u/_WebOfTrust):

Claim is still not working for me; I changed to custom RPC, but Rabby is not responding. However, there is some hope on a related topic. Every time I used to look at DAO governance, I would see the same faces as delegates with only token-based governance, which never motivated me to contribute or participate. Everything changed when Optimism governance was announced (plus few other things).

I just looked at the ZKsync delegate page. The Ethfinance delegate combined has a voting power of more than 10M ZKsync (Benido + haurog + Liberosist + smol amount delegate to me as well). This might be a fraction compared to Syncswap or Olimpio, but the point of my rambling is to highlight a change, a positive change that I wanted to see. New faces, views, opinions, and ideas- not just projects representing themselves as delegates, but also community members. Even though they are invested directly, they care about the ecosystem and want to drive it in a positive direction. 

Haurog DM'd me on Farcaster to create a profile as they could not see my profile there, and time was running out. Benido took this initiative to form a sort of delegation council emerging from Ethfinance. To me, I don't see any financial benefits they might be getting for doing this apart from their belief in helping, improving, and contributing to this evolving ecosystem.

So, my dudes, thank you, and I look forward to reading more from you outside of this forum.

<summary>u/haurog summarises an article on why stakers sometimes miss attestations</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1djb287/daily_general_discussion_june_19_2024/l99u2wt/)

Lighthouse devs released a blog post about attestation misses. It goes into a lot of details on the path from attestation creation until it is included in a block and discusses all the possible ways an attestation might not get included due to failures at any of the intermediate steps. It also shows how to analyze the origin of possible misses in the logs and their grafana dashboard. This part is obviously focused on how to do it with lighthouse. All in all it is a great read.

The take home message is that quite often attestation misses are outside of the users control. To minimize attestation misses the user can make sure that their clock is synced, has opened the necessary ports to get enough peers and have a hardware setup which does not have a bottleneck (SSD, CPU and bandwidth) to make sure to get attestations out as efficiently as possible.

<summary>u/Ber10 shares some thoughts in light of the ETF approval</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cyksus/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2024/l5engzh/)

Now just in case people are starting to speculate about other crypto currencies getting an ETF. Only Bitcoin and Eth have embarked on this journey. There were several milestones that took years to achieve.

Namely CFTC Futures and Futures ETF. For CFTC Futures there needs to be a sufficiently liquid market of a certain size before that is going to happen. I honestly dont see any coin following Eth quickly at this stage. 

Other coins do not have that nor is there any application or similar filed for this. So even if we assume an expedited process for the next coin. We wont see it any time soon imo. If FIT21 gets approved in the Senate there will be finally clear rules to see what constitutes a security and what a commodity in the crypto space. Decentralization IS important and the entire point of crypto. The market being to dense to realize this doesnt change the fact that this is the reason why crypto exists and why it is valuable in the first place.

I am really happy to see america moving towards clear rules when it comes to crypto. Being a crypto security should also not be a death sentence because if the SEC does their job their will be a clear path ahead for exchanges and security tokens to be traded.

Removing uncertainty from crypto is a great step. It will help the market mature and also will kill many needless CT discussions.

Next fight is uniswap legal precedent there will be very very bullish for ethereum and defi. Defi could finally become part and replace parts of traditional finance forever.

Ethereum is the future.

<summary>u/haurog stumbled upon a cool tool for some exploit victims</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cyksus/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2024/l5ag1w4/)

I stumbled upon hackedwalletrecovery.com, which helps you recover funds if your wallet has been hacked and a drainer is observing your wallet. It helps you build a flashbots bundle which moves ETH from a non-compromised wallet to the hacked wallet and then moves the desired token out of the hacked wallet address. This happens all in one bundle which is sent to the flashbots RPC to make sure it never hits the mem pool. The wallet drainer monitoring the wallet cannot steal your funds as they do not see the transactions and it will happen in one big transaction anyway.

I learned about this project from a presentation by Austin Griffith who works at the Ethereum Foundation. This is a project from the BuildGuidl which does the 'speedrun ethereum' course. I personally have not tested it as I do not have a hacked wallet available, but I clicked around a bit and it overall makes sense even though some steps leave me a bit puzzled. It is a very limited tool, but maybe it will help someone recover some of their funds in case of a hack.

So, what will ETF flows be? Obviously significantly less than the BTC ones IMO but let's look at what happened in Canada with their ETFs:

CI Galaxy:

- [ETH](https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-ether-etf) .47B (CAD)

Evolve ETFs:

- [BTC](https://evolveetfs.com/product/ebit/) 240M (CAD)
- [ETH](https://evolveetfs.com/product/ethr/) 92M (CAD)

3iq:

- [BTC](https://3iq.io/3iq-bitcoin-etf-btcq-2) 326M (CAD)
- [BTC](https://3iq.io/ca/the-bitcoin-fund-qbtcu-qbtc) 615M (CAD)
	- Total 941M CAD

- [ETH](https://3iq.io/ca/the-ether-fund-qethu-qethun#section_4) 366M (CAD)
	- Total 438M (CAD)

I'd say 20-30% is the benchmark, though many of these Canadian funds are staking which the new US ones will not be.

[u/15kisFUD](https://reddit.com/u/15kisFUD):

Some sobering thoughts:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx4pwSXycck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx4pwSXycck)

James Seyffart makes a pretty good case for why he thinks ETH ETF inflows will amount to around 20% of Bitcoin inflows. His argument: Market cap is around 1/3 so base case would be 33%, but you lose more with putting your ETH into an ETF compared to Bitcoin.

1. You lose staking yield.
2. You lose utility of using ETH in defi etc

Makes sense to me. Bitcoin was made to put in an ETF and it's core to its value proposition. The entire ETF narrative just fits Bitcoin better. On the day of the Blackrock BTC filing, the ratio was 0.065. Given that I think ETFs are more bullish for Bitcoin than ETH, I think the ratio should even out around 0.058-0.061 now to fully price in ETH's ETF.

For ETH to improve on the ratio and take the spotlight away from Bitcoin it needs something more, something that is core to Ethereum to take off. This could be real adoption by institutions like with the BUIDL funds, a new mania like with ICO's or NFTs or the breakout consumer dAPP that we have been waiting so long for. Perhaps the improved regulatory climate is the catalyst for this, I hope it is. If such an event does happen, the ETH ETF will allow a pathway for a lot of net inflows making a flippening more possible. So it could end up getting more inflows eventually, I just think that the mere existence of an ETH ETF is not sufficient to take significant market share from Bitcoin.

That being said. I am extremely happy that ETH got it's own ETF, mainly so it does not start falling even further behind Bitcoin in the zeitgeist. It's back to "Bitcoin, ETH and the rest" instead of "Bitcoin and the rest" and that is extremely bullish

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1czcy7e/daily_general_discussion_may_24_2024/l5ft4h0/)

Had a first round interview at one the biggest crypto media companies in the space on May 6th. And was asked what my most controversial take was. I said I think the ETH ETF would be approved by the end of the summer. The interviewer strongly disagreed and said there were not any signs pointing towards that. They decided to pass on me after the second interview. Oh well I will just keep building.   
   
In other news I have been collecting a bunch of data to start to look into the correlation between price/price change/market cap/market cap change and social media/GitHub metics. My first shallow dive into some of the data showed a Pearson correlation of 0.72 (which is pretty damn good) between market cap and twitter followers. After dropping meme coins (often have bought/fake followers), CEX tokens (they have a bunch of followers because they are well known, but most tokens are not valuable), and pure BNB ecosystem tokens (the theory here is that Chinese users probably don't use crypto Twitter much, which I would assume are a large percentage of BNB buyers and users). Going to test the correlation going back historically next, and see how this changes during bear/bull. Will also look to see if month over month changes in market cap are correlated with month over month Twitter follower count change. Finally I want to use all this to build a index / watch list for coins that are gaining momentum, tying in trends that indicate a coin in the say top 200 to top 500 by market cap is on a trajectory to the top 100 by MC. My theory is two fold, one is network effects, the more followers a page has the more it gets shown to other users via the algo and second coins are the ultimate marketing tool as buyers are likely to talk about a project when they buy, trying to get others to buy, others will follow the project to learn more before potentially buying then repeating the process. Plus most projects get more useful with more users and liquidity/TVL.
   
Any feedback or thought ideas are much appreciated.

Hey ethfinanciers, I want to warn about a very sophisticated scam that I was targeted with (unsuccessfully, of course). 

If you get contacted about some kind of job at a very legit looking (at first glance) project called UNI APT, it is A SCAM.

Seems obvious to some of us, but it is a rather elaborate and above all expensive social engineering scam.

If you want more details about it check this tweet: <https://x.com/iknowgoodthings/status/1790737051219845562>

Every single person claiming to be a member of this whole UniAPT or UNI APT project is a SCAMMER, so please please beware. Their twitter account is @uniaptio, PLEASE BE VIGILANT AND STAY SAFE OUT THERE.

This is not the first scam of its kind, there are plenty like this, so be careful, doubt everything they say, DO NOT DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE FROM RANDOM ENTITIES ONLINE and NEVER give deeply personal information to them.

Every time I venture out into other crypto subreddits I am always disappointed. They are either ghost towns or filled with mostly bots/shills.

I was worried that this community would fall apart when ethfinance forked from ethtrader. Instead, what happed is all the knowledgeable and engaged people came here. While ethtrader became completely filled with bots trying to earn money on donuts. Forking ethfinance also had the side effect of purging most of the bots/shills that ethtrader had accumulated over the years, so the signal to noise ratio actually improved too.

While I hope our community will continue to grow, the fact that it smaller and less known has actually been a big blessing, since the bots and shills go to the largest subreddits to chase the largest audience. With ethfinance being outside the top 25 crypto subreddits, we manage to fly under the radar of many bots/shills. The main downside is that it makes it harder for ETH newbies to find good information about ethereum, but it also preserves our unique culture here.

TLDR - Thanks for being such a great community ETHFinanciers! Crypto and ethereum wouldn't be the same without the high quality daily discussions here.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade has a grounded take on the Mt Gox repayments</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1d2bjkm/daily_general_discussion_may_28_2024/l61hrwl/)

Ok reading several posts on the daily insinuating that the latest Mt Gox news are FUD.

It's not FUD, repayments are coming soon. It's been a decade long saga but it's close to certain that it's about to end.

Cash repayments already happened, **I'm one of the creditors and I received cash about a month ago**. I'm sure others here are creditors too.

[I wrote in here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/q31rj5/comment/hfrqn85/) about the rehabilitation plan 3 years ago, which is the point at which it had been determined what to do with the remaining fiat, bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Deadline to vote on the plan was then extended two years to make sure all creditors could fill all required documents, [I wrote about this in ethfinance too](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11lo2v3/comment/jbfjyso/?context=3).

Then in April 2023, [I wrote here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/comment/jerl582/?context=3) that the deadline was most likely not going to be extended this time. This was confirmed a few days later, no deadline extension, [I've informed Ethfinance too](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12eagbz/comment/jfaro68/?context=3).

Cash repayment started in December 2023 with a fuckup that later got solved, I[ was sharing the info too](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18rth8u/comment/kf3z0bs/?context=3).

Then in February 2024 [I told you guys that I believed the bitcoin repayment was likely to happen in 2024](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1alov71/comment/kphhigm/?context=3), and everything points at this.

Today [$2.9B of bitcoin belonging to creditors and expected to be paid this years were moved to a new wallet](https://www.theblock.co/post/296922/mt-gox-moves-at-least-2-9-billion-in-bitcoin-for-first-time-in-five-years). This is in preparation to repayments that are likely to start soon.

Close to 1% of all bitcoin in existence are expected to be reenter circulation.

This will clearly have an effect on the market, and there's going to be some btc selling. But I expect a significant portion to be reallocated to eth. Even if it's far from statistically significant, [a post in the Mt Gox insolvency subreddit today](https://np.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/1d2doxj/diversifying_into_eth/) asked members if they intended to diversify in eth, most popular opinions were yes.

Regardless of price action, this post is just meant to say that it's not a rumor, it's not FUD, Mt Gox repayments are most likely happening within a few months.

I don't normally write huge blog posts, but I am very passionate about getting EOF and PeerDas, among other upgrades included in an Ethereum upgrade sooner rather than later. I started writing, and it became a blog post.

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1d1yce1/why_we_should_ship_eof_peerdas_and_other_upgrades/>

[Google Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yp6jpmOLxwtIqwGppMrzwVHuPItJX8aZT0vX17cAmhw/edit?usp=sharing)  

Part 1 gives educational background of how Ethereum upgrades work and gives definitions.  

Part 2 gives my long form reasons of why I believe that Pectra should either be a large upgrade --dubbed Mega Pectra, or split into Pectra 1 and Pectra 2 to make testing easier. Either way, I think EOF and PeerDas should be included before a year+ upgrade that will see the database structure of Ethereum transition from Merkle Trees to Verkle Trees.

Hi everyone!

Thanks to Tricky\_Troll for pointing out an error on [kollit.ai](http://kollit.ai) . the issue was related to some math issue, which stemmed from my parallel development of a new and improved website for Kollit. Anyways i am like 95% sure it's fixed now :D

Despite the lack of recent updates (i think the last update was more than a month ago), I've been thrilled to see so many of you continuing to use Kollit. It's the best feeling ever!

Since you guys brought it up organically, I want to give you a sneak peek of the new website: [here's a preview](https://imgur.com/g8uv3xX). I'm working hard with another developer to bring you the best version of Kollit possible.

once it's ready, I'll be looking for around 10-20 alpha testers. If you're interested in being part of this testing group and providing feedback on the new platform, please leave a comment below or send me a DM.

Wishing you all optimal trading!

It looks like Biden's crypto about-face is complete and they go back hat-in-hand to the crypto industry they spent a whole presidential cycle persecuting: [https://www.theblock.co/post/297504/biden-campaign-shifts-crypto-stance-engages-crypto-industry-presidential-elections-2024](https://www.theblock.co/post/297504/biden-campaign-shifts-crypto-stance-engages-crypto-industry-presidential-elections-2024)

If I was a crypto lobbyist though, I would expect way more from the administration than an eth ETF approval before I open my purse for the Dems (albeit it was a welcome first step): (1) approval (not just pocket veto) of the SAB-121 resolution, (2) Gary Gensler at least announcing that eth is a commodity and dropping their most egregious anti-crypto lawsuits, if not retiring for family reasons :-), (3) Elizabeth Warren not just sulking in the background but eating dirt in public or, even better, Biden appointing one of the high profile pro-crypto Dem politicians in her place as the political crypto policy head honcho. She had three and a half years to do damage, that should be enough. In fact, (4) a presidential speech praising the crypto industry as a beacon of American innovation and worthy of support, enumerating such concrete measures would not be amiss :-). Cheap talk is cheap.

It is a tale as old as time. In the days of yore it was the exploitation of serfs and the indentured servitude of the layman for the few pulling the strings at the top. Nowadays it is venture capitalists going public once market saturation is reached and multinational corporations squeezing the last drop of profits through shrinkflation and enshittification so that they can buy up all of the family homes in western nations.

It was said, that one day the tables would turn. Some thought that was the communist revolution in Russia, but we all know how that turned out. Other more shrewd folks have been saying that the wealth flippening has yet to come and is almost upon us. The time is nigh. I can feel it in my loins.

From 2009 onwards, for the first time in history, the little guy could get access to new financial primitives from the very beginning. Following Bitcoin's unprecedented rise, there was a second opportunity with the Ethereum ICO which launched in 2014. Open to all, the gateway into a new financial system had opened. Sometime in 2017, I somehow stumbled my way onboard this movement and that's despite being a broke university student. But that didn't matter. That's just how big this opportunity was. Shortly afterwards, the long rumoured flippening was supposedly on the table ‚Äî no, not the ETH/BTC flippening ‚Äî the flippening which the lower and middle class have been waiting for since the dawn of time. The flippening of financial opportunity.

For once, the incumbent, antiquated systems designed to entrench wealth amongst the upper class was holding them back from the latest opportunity. The gatekeepers of TradFi tasked with keeping the everyday man "safe" from the best wealth building opportunities now found themselves gatekeeping the rich and powerful out of the biggest opportunity yet. At first they laughed. Such an opportunity couldn't be anything other than a bubble! But the bubble showed no signs of popping. Soon, they realised that they had to fight it or else it would become entrenched on its own, outside of the existing system. Knowing better, the grassroots community building out this new paradigm did not yield. With every line of code and every battle fought in court, their new system became stronger, more resilient.

And so here we are. Sitting on the precipice of this long rumoured flippening. The cycle is nearly complete. Upon realising the inevitable game theory of a superior technology in an adversarial and capitalist world, the Finks of the world made their intentions clear and the gatekeepers could no longer stand in their way. The future is tokenised and the future is public. The big gates are opening. For the first time in human history, the people have had the opportunity to front run the establishment. The established has become the exit liquidity. The institutions are coming.

It has been an honour being on this ride with you, gents. Not only has this opportunity been once in a lifetime, it has been once in an aeon. Gentlemen is imminent.

Lol just kidding. Larry, you can pry my ETH from my cold, dead hands. This solo staker ain't going anywhere. If you're lucky you can have my staking rewards for a pretty penny.

<summary>u/Belligerent_Chocobo shares some reason for optimism</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ct57il/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2024/l4cjk33/)

Okay you debbie downers, here's some small bits of optimism:

1) [Article highlighting growing tokenization push by TradFi,](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/16/dtcc-chainlink-complete-pilot-to-accelerate-fund-tokenization-with-jpmorgan-templeton-bny-mellon-participating/) this time in the form of a pilot project involving some TradFi heavyweights (bonus - in article, note the image referring to DTCC's Ethereum network... every time I read about tokenization, it always seems to be riding on Ethereum's rails)

2) Yesterday, BTC [broke out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1sQsHDua/) of its downward trend since March, and is also just over its 50 day SMA. Yes yes, I know many here love to shit on TA, and Bitcoin for that matter, but a rising tide lifts all boats, and this *could* be telling us that the worst of the pain is over (which isn't to say we won't go sideways for months). Concurrent ATH's on the S&P and Nasdaq don't hurt, either.

3) Look, ETH ETF denial is priced in. And not only that, I'd go as far as to say that if the main reason for denial is some bullshit like 'weak correlation between spot and futures', ETH's price is likely to see a nice bounce. And *even if* the SEC goes the 'it's a security' route, I'm still not even convinced that it'll be bad for price. After all, the market has already been digesting this possibility for months, and there will at least be less *uncertainty*, something markets loathe. Anecdotally, back in January 2017 when the the Winklevii BTC spot ETF got rejected (right around halving time, not unlike now), BTC briefly spiked down before rocketing up throughout the balance of the year. I'm not saying it's an exact analog, but rather--it always seems darkest before dawn.

Now quit yer bitchin!

Not sure if this was posted here already, maybe I didn't spot it between all the whining. 

Coinbase published a [research piece about their Ethereum outlook](https://www.coinbase.com/en-de/institutional/research-insights/research/monthly-outlook/monthly-outlook-may-2024). 

tl;dr: they're as bullish as ever

>We think that ETH may yet have the potential to surprise to the upside in
the coming months. ETH does not appear to have major sources of supply
side overhangs such as token unlocks or miner sell pressure. To the
contrary, both staking and L2 growth have proven to be meaningful and
growing sinks of ETH liquidity. ETH‚Äôs position as the center of DeFi is also
unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the
EVM and its L2 innovations.

>That said, the importance of potential spot US ETH ETFs cannot be
understated. We think the market may be underestimating the timing and
odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside.
In the interim, we believe the structural demand drivers for ETH as well as
the technological innovations within its ecosystem will enable it to continue
straddling across multiple narratives

<summary>u/eth2353 covers the appeal of the Alexey Pertsev Tornado Cash case and u/Defacticool shares their take as someone involved with European law</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ctx7h5/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2024/l4hbfdw/)

[u/eth2353](https://reddit.com/u/eth2353):

In the interest of keeping you updated on the Tornado Cash case in the Netherlands against Alexey Pertsev, his legal team [filed an appeal with the local court of appeals](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/16/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-appeals-guilty-verdict/) right away, on the day of the verdict. It is not yet clear whether the appeal has been approved, but the good news is, according to some sources Alexey is free on bail for the time being.

Since I'm not a lawyer I didn't feel qualified to objectively judge the court's verdict, I like to leave these things to subject matter experts. Thankfully, today a local Dutch law firm published [an article (in English!)](https://hertoghsadvocaten.nl/en/kennisbank/tornado-cash-the-developer-as-co-perpetrator-of-money-laundering/) analysing the verdict and concluding: "From my perspective, the judgment fails to address these questions adequately, indicating that it is ripe for appeal."

Here's what I found most interesting:

> **The role of Pertsev in Tornado Cash**
> 
> The court asserts that Pertsev, alongside co-suspects Roman Storm and Roman Semenov‚Äîwho are under prosecution in the US‚Äîare the creators of Tornado Cash. They engineered the system to function autonomously and immutably. Since the system‚Äôs basic operations were unalterable from the outset, the court holds these individuals are and remain accountable for its functionality.
> 
> In December 2020, the governance of Tornado Cash was transferred to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), meaning its governance structure was by then overseen by the community. However, the court concludes that the foundational operations of the system were unchangeable and, therefore, the original setup by the founders remains a critical factor.
> 
> **Co-perpetration Concerns**
> 
> The court‚Äôs reasoning on co-perpetration seems flawed to me. It suggests that Tornado Cash, let‚Äôs call it a digital platform or system, independently enacted the acts of hiding and concealing cryptocurrency with a criminal origin. This implies that a system can engage in criminal behaviour on its own‚Äîan unusual and potentially problematic interpretation, as it shifts the criminal conduct itself from individuals to systems. [...] This could have significant implications for software developers if tools are perceived as independently capable of criminal actions, making the developers responsible for the tool‚Äôs ‚Äòactions‚Äô.
> 
> **Questioning criminal intent**
> 
> Another aspect open to criticism is how the court motivates Pertsev‚Äôs criminal intent. [...] The court‚Äôs assumption that the general knowledge that mixers could be used for criminal activities was enough to establish Pertsev‚Äôs intent for these specific transactions is questionable.
> 
> The court argues it is common knowledge that mixers are used by criminals, citing a report by the Financial Action Task Force and the classification by the Financial Intelligence Unit in The Netherlands dated August 15, 2017, that the use of a mixer is a money laundering typology. [...] Does foreseeing that your software might be used by criminals make you criminal liable for their actions? And what did Pertsev know at that moment in time, as the assumed common knowledge in 2019 is highly debatable? The case file might indicate Pertsev was aware of criminal usage of Tornado Cash at some point, but this does not necessarily relate to his actions at the time he set up the system or to the timing of the specific transactions.
> 
> I believe the judgment for Pertsev‚Äôs criminal intent was poorly motivated, and the legal intricacies remain underexplored. An appeal will be necessary to address these issues thoroughly.

[u/Defacticool](https://reddit.com/u/Defacticool):

As someone in a legal field in a different EU country (Sweden), I cant say anything about dutch law necessarily.

But if our system is any indication of their system, it wouldnt at all be surprising if the lowest courts is a coinflip of whether theyre reasonable and rational or batshit. 

And it also would surprise me if their lower courts (in this case and in general) defer to the "common sense" conclusion simply because this case is so novel, and leave it to higher courts to delve into the nuances if they deem it reasonable to do so. 

Stupid as it may sound a lower court (so less authority, lowest hierarchy, little to none precedential power) may well decide to err on the side of simplicity because it recognises the complicated nature of a novel legal question is above their paygrade and they could throw a wrench in the gears by trying to "properly" deal with the complication. 

At the same time a universal legal principle is that for criminal law the courts should side on the benefit of the defendant, where the law isnt entirely clear. So its not like I'm happy with the situation. 

Also I will say that a reason for why the lower courts being tolerated for what they are here in sweden is because we have an automatic right to appeal (it cant be denied) to the second level courts. So a criminal case will always be tried at a second instance if the defendant wants it to. 

I cant find online if the dutch have a similar systems, but if they do it would also go a long way to explain why a lower court may be less hesitant to be more stringent to a defendant. 

The dutch also seem to have a more professionalist second instance of a tribunal of 3 judges, so the risk of the important questions simply being ignored is significantly lesser than in a trial with a single arbiter.

<summary>u/interweaver explains the 2022 MEV theft exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cupmmt/daily_general_discussion_may_18_2024/l4m90l4/)

So Ethereum processes lots of user transactions. Those transactions are submited to many places, but commonly the public mempool that is maintained by all the Ethereum nodes. Validators propose new blocks to add to the blockchain, and they are the party that gets to decide which transactions, and in which order, those new blocks contain. If they do this themself, it is called "local block building"; but in practice, most validators use a piece of software called MEV-Boost (more on why it's called that shortly) to receive built blocks from external builders, who pay the validator for the privilege of selecting the block's contents. Those blocks are passed to the validator via a "neutral" third party called a relay.

Now, many of those user transactions "leave money on the table" in one form or another, and clever third parties can take that money, which we call MEV, for themselves. They usually do that with the use of bots.

A common (and relevant here) example of MEV would be sandwiching, in which a user submits a transaction for a dex trade, but with a relatively large slippage set, which means that the market can move by that percentage from where the user saw it, and the trade is still valid. A MEV bot that is able to see that transaction before it goes through (which is easy if it was submitted to the public mempool) can come along and frontrun/backrun the transaction, by taking a large amount of money (often VERY large) and making their own trade on the dex, moving the price in a direction disadvantageous to the victim, then letting the victim's trade go through (losing some money due to slippage), and then going back in with the backrun tx and recovering all their starting money, plus some extra that came from the victim's slippage.

It is of extreme importance (for the MEVer) that that sequence of three transactions (frontrun, victim trade, backrun) happen in exactly that order, without any other transactions in between, because potentially those other transactions might also trade on the same dex, and might do the "wrong" thing versus what the MEVer wanted, i.e. trading in the opposite direction from the victim transaction, which would result in the MEVer losing money instead of the victim. So these transactions are submitted in "bundles" by the MEV bot to the external block builder; the block builder promises to keep those bundles in exactly that order and without anything in between. That allows the MEV exploit to successfully take the money the victim transaction "left on the table". It is essential that the MEVer can trust the builder to leave their bundles alone.

An excellent question at this juncture: the validator has to sign off on blocks that they submit. Why couldn't the validator see all of the transactions in the block and mess with the MEV transactions themself? The answer is that MEV-Boost is designed such that the relay just passes the validator the *header* of the block, which is the thing that needs signing. The validator has no idea what's in the block, or if it is even valid, when they sign it. This is a fairly trusting thing to do, but the ecosystem has accepted it. Back in 2023, as soon as the validator signed the header, the relay would send the rest of the contents of the block to the validator (who could now see the MEV transactions, but has already signed that version of the block, and so cannot change the block, at risk of getting slashed), and the validator would broadcast the block body to the network, and everything is hunky dory.

So that's all necessary context for what happened. These smart brothers from MIT realized that in some cases, it's actually worth it to get slashed. They set up their own validators, got some bot code ready to go, and waited.

When it was their turn to propose a block, they received the block header from the relay via MEV-Boost, signed it and sent it back, and were sent the block body (with all the transactions) like usual. But instead of broadcasting that block, they looked at the transactions, and saw that there were some juicy MEV sandwiches going on inside there. (In fact, they had made sure of that, by putting their own 'victim' transactions into the public mempool to bait the sandwich bot, once they knew they were going to be proposing.) And their bot unbundled those MEV sandwiches and did the thing the MEVers assumed no one could do: they inserted their own dex transaction in between the sandwich frontrun and backrun, going the "wrong way". They did this in such a way that essentially all of the sandwich bot's money, which again can be a LARGE amount, and in this case was around $25M, was eaten up by their inserted transaction. Basically the MEVer got MEV'd.

After *very quickly* doing all this, they took their modified block, signed *that* block, and broadcast it to the network as quickly as possible. Now there were two versions of the block floating around, one the original that they had to sign in order to see the block transactions, and one the modified version that they also had to sign. The modified block won (they made sure of this via another clever trick outside the scope of this post). Of course, signing two blocks is grounds for getting slashed on Ethereum, and their validator did indeed get slashed, losing the usual 1 Eth. 

But the brothers were able to take $25M of the MEVers' money, which they thought was completely safe, but due to this loophole in the way MEV-Boost worked, was actually not. (The loophole was subsequently patched by having the relay broadcast the signed block body to the network for several seconds before sending it back to the validator, so the validator doesn't have a chance of getting their own version of the block accepted).

Was this a crime? I honestly don't know haha. A lot of us were cheering for them at the time, because it was a case of one of the Dark Forest inhabitants who regularly preys on normal users, getting eaten by an even bigger and darker denizen of the Forest. On that battleground, I think a lot of us assume that everything is fair game; if you play that game you'd better be ready to watch your back. But it would appear that the MEVers that got taken advantage of are both wealthy and pissed off, and that's a recipe for lawsuits. We'll see what happens. It will be a fascinating case from the "code is law" perspective - the MEV people will have to argue that this was a crime without also implicating their own entire business model in equivalent crimes haha.

That‚Äôs impressive! The huge worries of Geth and Lido are gone, which ones are the worries now?

Again, another great example of how the ethereum community got  proactively started involved into keeping the health of the ethereum ecosystem.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

The following is my current understanding

They have split up the staking into two tokens now. ETH and EIGEN. Before that the goal was to only use ETH. In my understanding, the problem with the old approach was that all the slashing would have happened on ETH, but most slashing conditions for the current round of AVSs are not verifiable on chain. This necessitates that one has to come to an agreement among AVS operators that one of them has to get slashed. Most of the time the conditions are pretty clear and they can come to an agreement. But in the case of malicious majority for a certain AVS, they can slash other operators, steal their ETH and there is nothing one can do, even though it is obvious that they are malicious actors. The only recourse is to make an irregular state transition, which means forking the ethereum chain like for the DAO hack reversal. It would be messy it would hurt Ethereum and is not something one would like to have again. This is in my understanding the issue with overloading the consensus layer. 

In the new system these kind of not fully objective slashing conditions are moved to the EIGEN token. If AVS operators collude to take away EIGEN from one operator, the community will most probably see this as an attack and can just fork away into a new EIGEN token. If the social consensus is that it was a malicious attack, the forked away EIGEN tokens will retain the value and the 'original' EIGEN token will lose its value. This takes a lot of power away from AVS operators and especially allows forking the value and security of the Eigenlayer protocol without forking the underlying Ethereum chain.

This greatly reduces the amount of ETH that is needed in the Eigenlayer protocol which will also reduce the amount of ETH staked in it which again helps with the resilience of Ethereum. Before that change there was the concern that every single ETH will be restaked. I do not see this happening anymore.

As said before, this is my current understanding of Eigenlayer and I am sure I missed some issues the protocol still has. I am definitely happy to learn about them.

<summary>u/Syentist covers some bad news for keeping Lido dominance at bay</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cw7lio/daily_general_discussion_may_20_2024/l4uwj1h/)

Some bad news on Lido staked ETH dominance: [https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/14/lido-co-founders-paradigm-secretly-back-eigenlayer-competitor-as-defi-battle-lines-form/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/14/lido-co-founders-paradigm-secretly-back-eigenlayer-competitor-as-defi-battle-lines-form/)

Paradigm and Lido plan to ship a restaking competitor to Eigenlayer. As you can imagine, Lido stETH deposits would be heavily incentivised in Symbiotic (ironic new name for the product), which will likely shoot up dominance higher.

On a side note: Cobie was a Lido co-founder (dont ask me how or why). Lido obviously foresees the social layer being another cock block for their new product when it ships. Cobies tweets in the past 48h would make more sense with that context.

A word of caution to everyone, old and new here:

Yes, this is one of the most bullish things that has ever happened in the Ethereum ecosystem and for crypto in general. The ramifications are huge. Legistlation was probably the biggest obstacle to the vision of Web 3.0, and now it seems like (and you feel like) the price is going to $5k, $10K, or $150K. I feel like that, too.

So you think to yourself: *Why shouldn't I leverage?* Maybe just 2x? Or 3x... or 10x. Your eyes are flashing with dollar signs. This rocketship can only go straight up, right?

Well, no. We are going up, yes, but the longs are piling atop of longs. A small rumour could move the needle *juuust* enough for a liquidation cascade. Don't let a sudden flash crash destroy what you have been patiently waiting for months, or years.

I can pretty much guarantee that this will happen as we go up. We are going to have 15%-25% red wicks. The volatility just demands it.

I have been burned by these crashes *a lot* when I didn't know better, and I believe I have learned my lesson. Don't do the same mistakes I did. You are not only going to lose money, you are going to fuck up your mental health and sleep, too.

Here, Bitcoiners have it right. The only thing you need to do is ***HODL***. Don't leverage. Don't try to trade the tops and bottoms. You will only give your money to the same whales that made your life miserable this past year. You want to get back to them, and those that fucked with us? The crypto influencers on twitter? The miners that paid to FUD PoS? The haters and shitcoin peddlers? Deny them the chance to have your Ether. Make them beg for it. Make them FOMO like they've never FOMO'd for any coin. Make the market go crazy.

***Fucking Hold On for Dear Life***... spot only, preferably in self-custody!

<summary>u/haurog dives into an interesting observation by an EF researcher</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cxsana/daily_general_discussion_may_22_2024/l54x11k/)

Yesterday, Toni Wahrst√§tter, an EF researcher, had an interesting talk at Dappcon about block sizes in Ethereum and how the size is distributed. Apparently some builders do not include as many blobs as others because including blobs gives little rewards, but could increase the risk of the block not propagating fast enough in the network and getting re-orged. As far as I understand beaverbuild, the largest builder, does include fewer blobs than Titan builder, the second largest one. Currently this is not a big deal as L2s can just increase the fee tip to make it more attractive to include the blob. But this generally hints at a mispriced resource within the Ethereum protocol. Similar with very large transactions that do not pay a high enough fee due to the very low priced calldata in the EVM.

As far as I see it, this needs to be fixed before increasing the number of blobs per block and probably also before increasing the block gas limit by a large amount.

And he also talks about how he broke sepolia with his super large transaction.

Definitely worth a listen:

It is late 2026, total crypto market cap reaches $50T after 10 consecutive memecoin seasons, all cyclical rotations in the cryptocurrency market have been replaced by memes.

Top 10 - all memes. Dogecoin and pepe replaced BTC and ETH, both receiving an ETF while the ETH ETF is still awaiting approval due to volatility and underlying utility concerns.

BTC and ETH linger at the low end of the top 25, just under recent newcomers: SkibbidyToiletInu69420XL, Kek, and Gamestop (unrelated coin, not the stock)

A soft hard recession that doesnt land is forecasted by JPow, whose forward guidance is expected to reduce some of the froth and risk seeking behaviour in the markets.¬†

<summary>u/eetherway thinks that fully on-chain games are now possible</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cnp6qx/daily_general_discussion_may_9_2024/l3cdmmd/)

*Posting directly here, as I was informed people don't like clicking through to Twitter links:*   
  
Building a fully onchain game is stupid, and you could just do it with existing infrastructure without needing the blockchain... at least that's what I'm told.¬†¬†

After spending 3 years building a FOCG, here are some of the least known and most impactful reasons to build them:üßµ

**1. Peer-to-peer infrastructure for gaming**

To create a player driven world, that enables play to flow between players without an intermediary requires significant infrastructure.

Traditionally this would be a set of servers that are rented/bought, maintained, and tooled by the gaming studio.¬†

While possible it is exorbitantly expensive, time consuming, and requires engineers to maintain. For an indie studio it's likely not a great use of resources, hence why we likely haven't seen it in traditional gaming.¬†

Building fully onchain significantly reduces cost and maintenance for teams which would otherwise make it prohibitive to build such games.¬†

Cost down, efficiency up

**2. Blockchains give us a world computer**

Blockchains like Ethereum have revolutionized the development landscape by enabling the creation of decentralized, peer-to-peer systems without the burden of maintaining costly infrastructure.

Teams no longer need to find independent solutions to develop applications that are universally accessible online without acting as intermediaries in transactions.¬†

This additionally helps eliminate many of the issues with "money exchanger" laws, as seen with platforms like Uniswap, where users transact directly, rather than something like Venmo that holds your funds.¬†

Reduces operation cost and maintenance needs ‚úÖ Helps avoid potential legal issues ‚úÖ

**3. Free Market & Asset Exchange**

Blockchains enable more efficient markets by allowing users to own and control their accounts and assets separate from the game itself.¬†

While traditional companies can support the buying, selling, and trading of items within games, these activities are usually centralized and restricted.¬†

By fostering open markets where players can freely transfer items without fear of bans or deletions by the game studio, we empower players to determine the value of their goods.¬†

This model also supports asset trading across different games, enabling players to use their collected items to access new games through trading. Players can do this without needing to download new launchers, software, third-party applications, or create new accounts and spend additional money.

Free Markets ‚úÖ Unrestricted trading ‚úÖ Trading across game titles ‚úÖ

---

We could make cars powered by steam, but we don't. We do this because it would be impractical.

Building fully onchain creates a new way to build games, and with recent advancements to scaling, blockchains have become incredible efficient in enabling this new way to build.

Lastly, these types of games whether built on traditional rails or with blockchain still need to be fun.

So even if one day we all believe building onchain games for specific game types is the best solution, it's up to the studio to craft experiences players want to play.

Curious to get your thoughts :)

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency tells a clever story to explain why Ark Invest may have intentionally put staking in their ETF only to remove again</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cohjve/daily_general_discussion_may_10_2024/l3jlr96/)

There once was a famous interior designer who served many high value business clients. She noticed her clients always wanted to have a hand in the design - after she laid out their place, they would always want to change it a little. They‚Äôd want it to ‚Äùpop more‚Äù, or ‚Äúfeel more chill‚Äù, or ‚Äúmore cozy‚Äù. This slowed down the designer‚Äôs job significantly, as she had to make a costly and time consuming second design pass to appease the client. 

After a pattern of this happening, the designer realized that her clients always felt like they needed to make at least one change to her designs, to convince their bosses that they added value and weren‚Äôt just standing around and letting a contractor make all the big decisions.

It was upon this realization that the designer had a brilliant idea. From then on she added a wooden statue of a duck to each of her new interior designs. Her new clients, when shown these designs, would say ‚Äúthat looks good, just remove the duck statue.‚Äù As this was an easy fix to make, it saved the interior designer a considerable amount of time and effort in redesigns. Her new designs were always approved, minus the duck, and she never had to do a second design pass again.

ETH ETFs are the design, staking is the duck, and the SEC is the manager who needs to feel like they had some input.

<summary>u/KuDeTa gives us an update on Aestus</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cohjve/daily_general_discussion_may_10_2024/l3h7ye1/)

I wanted to give a short update on the EigenLayer Aestus AVS Operator - especially since the $EIGEN "stakedrop" *(lol)* went live earlier today. Over the last 3 weeks or so we've attracted about [\~3000ETH from \~100 participants](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x30eafe8869a1528660a97b7a7e8e2d0037dcb922). This is a pretty reasonable(!) start and we're obviously tremendously grateful for the continued support from members of this and the wider solo-staker community. That said, we're also keen to grow this significantly over the next 6 months. 

u/AustonSt and I have been pretty focussed on onboarding with all the AVS that will have us. The vast majority require explicit whitelisting so communication is essential. Many of the teams have been very straightforward to deal with, but there are others who make contact very difficult, or will only accept KYC'd (institutional) capital. I'm not surprised by this, but it's kind of depressing, and it's important we push back against this as much as we can. 

While slashing isn't live (and it looks like it will be some time before it's developed) - the risks to Operators and re-staked capital is pretty small. But it will grow, and we've been having conversations with a few neutral participants who are interested in figuring out how to manage this. The independent development of a risk framework seems important and we hope to be able to share some kind of plan in the near future. 

For now, we're publishing a [table](https://www.notion.so/aestusop/Aestus-AVS-Status-2df3147bbcb044289e1a5fe7e3fb24aa) with an overview of our status and progress with various services. We'd eventually like to be able to share a proper dashboard with live data, but this is some way off. We're also opening a Telegram [channel](https://t.me/AestusOp) for those of you who want to help us coordinate, receive updates or just want to ask us questions.

<summary>u/Syentist shares some thoughts on a recent thread by hasu</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cp9ldj/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2024/l3joj4j/)

This recent [thread by Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1788944317782114496) has a lot of great points on what Lido has been doing to better align with the ethereum ecosystem this past year. One [specific comment](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1788944375160213742) - which encourages Lido to participate in Ethereum roadmap research has received some negative comments from community members which makes me scratch my head 

a) "a player with a financial interest should not take part in Ethereum research and governance". Wut? We literally built a monetary coordination platform, Ethereum, where every single user has a financial incentive. And then we say that if you have a financial incentive, you can't take part in governance? Makes no sense to me

b) "a large player should not be allowed to take part in Ethereum governance". If that view is normalised, that large players - who are by definition successful players in the ecosystem - are discouraged from contributing to ethereum's future, who does that leave? One could make the argument, via the process of elimination, that then we are encouraging unsuccessful players, people who never had the competency nor the courage to spin off their own project or to do it in a successful manner at scale - we instead encourage them to exert their voices. That is instilling a negative selection process which leads to a poorer quality of discussion within the Ethereum ecosystem. Besides that, large players have a wealth of information and experience pertinent to our ecosystem, and it's unwise to exclude their voices.

The key point I think we should be mindful of, is that success isn't a bad word, having financial motives isn't a bad word. *Using your protocol dominance to arm twist other players to get your preferred outcome*, or *using your financial competency to bribe other players to get your preferred outcome*, outcomes which are at odds with the long term good of Ethereum - these are what needs to be focused on. But if a protocol isn't engaging in such behaviour, they certainly should have a seat at the governance table.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll relates the recent auroras to Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cq04yl/daily_general_discussion_may_12_2024/l3oo8k7/)

I saw auroras from mainland NZ last night. They weren't exactly spectacular without a long exposure photo to bring out the colours, but it was still pretty incredible. Now before you say this is off-topic, yes, this is related to ETH.

It would seem to be something which doesn't get much attention, but likely since it is a developing thing which may just be noise and not a sign of things to come. However, there is an increasingly alarming trend which started about 150 years ago which has gone exponential in the last 20-30 years. This is the shifting of Earth's magnetic poles. Now this isn't unprecedented. It has actually happened hundreds of times in Earth's history, but it is the first time since we have had advanced technology. Now, if the trend continues and Earth's magnetic poles shift, we could be in for a few hundred years of a reduction of Earth's geomagnetic shield which protects us from the sun's damaging radiation. What this means, and what we have already seen, is that the solar storms which have recently hit Earth are causing more electromagnetic disruption and auroras than storms of their size historically have because our shield is in a weakened state. This can result in localised blackout and infrastructure failures across the world. While a global outage is very unlikely, these localised impacts can be very disruptive to the global economy. This weekend alone dozens more platforms and services have had outages than usual and if any of these services are core infrastructure like banking or credit card services then the economy can grind to a halt.

This is yet another reason why we need Ethereum. We need resilient payment and settlement networks. Otherwise, our ever increasingly unstable world will perpetuate more instability. Especially as we constantly increase our reliance on a larger number of infrastructure systems from roads, to power, internet, AI and beyond. We have a unique chance to solidify one of the flimsy legs which hold up society and replace it with a rigid, decentralised and resilient system.

Edit: If you want to watch a good YouTube video on the ongoing pole shift and what it might mean for us, I highly recommend this one:

<summary>u/TheCryptosAndBloods nearly fell for a phishing scam</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cqr9e8/daily_general_discussion_may_13_2024/l3u6uch/)

All these years in crypto and still *just* barely avoided falling for a phishing scam toda

These guys are so incredibly good it's scary - I had my Ledger in my hand to sign the fake transaction and there was *juust* enough friction to drop me out of autopilot and make me think "what is actually going on here". 

I have some liquidity in Reya Network - it's a (legit) new trading optimized L2 with a "shared liquidity" model for all DEXes on the L2 and some major backers. It's launching this week but liquidity deposits for points have been open for some weeks. 

I went and checked my rank on the Leaderboard on the (real) reya.network site, and then I thought "Oh they are launching today - better go check their Twitter to see what's going on"

So I checked their Twitter update, and at the bottom of their (real) thread about the new Session and points etc, there was a final tweet saying something like "check your position on the Trading Leaderboard for Session 1 here" and I thought "Oh, is this a separate leaderboard to the liquidity leaderboard I am on? Better check it out"

[NOTE: the final tweet was of course from a phishing account but I only noticed when I checked later - the language, wording, PFP etc, were all perfect except for a one-character difference in the username]

So I click over to the [FAKE - DO NOT CLICK - "Reya Labs" site]. 

- Cognitive Dissonance 1: I remember thinking "Huh? Reya Labs? I thought their site was Reya Network?" - but I *did nothing* and went ahead
- Cognitive Dissoance 2: The site *looked* like the real site, but it said the current "boost" for early depositors was 5x - but the actual boost is 2.5x I think and has not been 5x for weeks - again, I noticed but thought "oh well, maybe if you do some social media tasks they will bump it up to 5x" - that does actually happen on the real site so it was a reasonable thought. 
- Cognitive Dissonance 3: There was some text, but not a lot of explanation - just something about "connect wallet to find out rank" - again, this is fairly normal so I did connect my wallet
- Cognitive Dissonance 4: It auto-switched me to Blast on Metamask and for the first time I was like "What? This is a new independent L2 and anyway it hasn't fully launched yet - why is it switching me to Blast? What's the connection?" But I still allowed it - we're still running on autopilot at this point. 
- Cognitive Dissonance 5: I *hate* it when dApps force you to sign a transaction just to sign in - it's understandable when you want to *do* something but it annoys me when it is necessary to just view your dashboard or rank - but again, it is unfortunately common, so I wasn't surprised when the popup came up and asked me to sign - but then I noticed that the text wasn't the usual English text string you see in this kind of thing but some very long string of numbers and *finally* got a bit suspicious and thought "I'm not signing something I don't understand especially just to see the Leaderboard and hit "Reject"
- Cognitive Dissonance 6: As soon as I hit "Reject", the popup just came up again with the same transaction to sign, which is behaviour I have never seen before - to keep the popup repeating without me triggering it again, and I actually thought about it for a second, but by this point it had hit my conscious mind that something was "off" and I slowed down, and then the whole thing fell apart of course (with a sigh of relief about how close a call it had been - I'm farming Blast and had quite a lot of personal funds there and the signature may have been useable on L1 mainnet too). 

But the psychology was really interesting to kind of think about how someone  like me who should know a lot better can still get taken in and the brain smooths over all the cognitive dissonance "warning" moments until they piled up enough that I was forced to acknowledge it..

[u/eth2353](https://reddit.com/u/eth2353):

Court statement in English available here - https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Rechtbanken/Rechtbank-Oost-Brabant/Nieuws/Paginas/Developer-of-Tornado-Cash-gets-jail-sentence-for-laundering-billions-of-dollars-in-cryptocurrency.aspx

Well, this is a sad day for crypto, privacy and building permissionless systems in general. Some excerpts:

> Tornado Cash functions in the way the defendant and his cofounders developed Tornado Cash. So the operation is completely their responsibility. If the defendant had wanted to have the possibility to take action against abuse, then he should have built it in. But he did not. Tornado Cash does not pose any barrier for people with criminal assets who want to launder them. That is why the court regards the defendant guilty of the money laundering activities as charged.

> Tornado Cash is not a legitimate tool that has unintentionally been abused by criminals, as the defendant presents. Tornado Cash suits criminal use.
>
> He also behaved lazily when victims of hacks or investigative authorities reported to him, simply stating that he could not do anything for them. He continued the development and exploitation of Tornado Cash with blinders on. He chose to look away from the abuse and did not take any responsibility.
>
> The court follows the prosecutor's demand and sentences the defendant to an imprisonment of 5 years and 4 months.

I don't fully remember the technical details but IIRC the contracts, once deployed, were not upgradable, so him saying "he could not do anything for [victims of hacks or investigative authorities]" was the truth right?

<summary>u/haurog explains the evolution of Ethereum's sharding vision</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cscw1a/daily_general_discussion_may_15_2024/l44pd5s/)

u/etheraider has [mentioned sharding yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1crk4ou/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2024/l40rkhp/) and when it will come. Sharding as a scaling solution been discarded at least 3 years ago. I first wanted to write a short reply but it got longer so I post it here. 

Sharding was the idea, that the Ethereum chain will be split up into different shards with each shard being able execute transactions. The core of the idea was that nodes would only have to validate a subset of all the shards leading to an increase in throughput without pushing home stakers out of the network by increasing resource demand. The problem in this approach is that shards cannot easily communicate with each other which complicates transactions as one would have to make additional transactions to move from one shard to another. Overall it became a rather complex solution. 

With the advent of rollups, people found that this allows for an easier and even more scalable solution. So in about 2021 the original sharding concept was abandoned and scaling through L2s is now considered the way to go. In my understanding there still is the concept of shards, but they were renamed to blobs and they cannot execute transactions. So the nodes do not have to run and validate the transactions which are stored in blobs. Rollups do this. 

With the dencun upgrade we got the first iteration of this scaling plan with EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding). This allowed scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem by about a factor of 50 to 100. Currently the rollups do around 10 times as many transactions than Ethereum does, so they still have room to grow. At the moment, we allow to have 3 blobs per block on average for rollup transaction data, which seems to be like a good value. It increases the load on nodes, but not so much to compromise decentralization. I guess there will be more analysis done in the coming months to see if we can increase the number of blobs a bit. 

The next step in the L2 scaling roadmap is danksharding, which will allow nodes to only store a subset of blobs for a limited time but still make sure that all the data has been published by the rollups using data availability sampling. This will increase the available blob space by at least another factor of 20 without increasing the load on nodes by the same amount. The details of this upgrade is very much being worked on and as far as I understand peerDAS (EIP-7594) is currently the best proposal to achieve that goal. Not sure if peerDAS is already the end goal or just a minimal implementation of data availability sampling.

I am not sure when this is planned to be implemented, but if it will not come in the next Ethereum upgrade. But maybe in the one after that. The good thing is that going from proto danksharding to full danksharding does mostly (or even only) involve changes in the consensus layer, which means there is less coordination necessary between the different teams. 

In addition there will be improvements of the Execution layer as well (like verkle trees, statelessness, history expiry and snarkifying the base chain). Those improvements will allow to increase transaction throughput on mainnet while keeping the resource demand for node operators in check. None of these will 100x increase throughput over night, but together they will massively scale Ethereum in the coming years. If you want to catch up on the current roadmap the bankless podcast from February does an amazing job explaining the different steps: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVaycBINdc>

Thoughts? This seems to me to be a pretty good summary of this cycle so far. What we have seen at the end of last cycle and in the bear market was that some stuff still pumped while other assets were down only --> micro cycles. Is this cycle the one where things really are (more) uncorrelated, both from stocks etc. but also within the crypto ecosystem?

These guys basically stole $25m by attacking MEV bots, they ran their own validators and when it was their turn to validate, they meddled and tampered proposed blocks with false signatures

<https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl>

Those guys who outsmarted MEVbots about a year ago, baiting them to extract $25M of their money?

They're now on trial for "conspiracy to commit wire fraud".

Steal billions from small users through automated sandwiches -> A-OK.

Steal millions from extremely wealthy sandwichers through a clever exploit -> straight to jail.

It has been clear for a long time the MEV landscape is filled with well-connected, well-capitalized tradfi individuals looking to extract maximum rent out of our ecosystem. Conspiracy to commit fraud, you say? I would love to have full transparency on every MEV actor out there and their doings. Would not be surprised if it turned out some of them pushed pro MEV sentiment through various means over the years. For the acceptance of robbing users as an unavoidable fact, or even worse, a desirable property, seems absurd at face value.

Idk man. I doubt that Blackrock, Van Eck, Franklin Templeton, Stripe, Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, JPM Chase etc. being interested in ETH is important. 

We probably won‚Äôt even see ATHs again, or even appreciate in price from here. 

When Larry Fink talks about instantaneous guaranteed settlement and the tokenization of securities I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs talking about Cardano or Solana. 

I‚Äôm sure Base deploying as a layer 2 on ETH instead of as an alt Layer 1 that‚Äôs just noise. 

The United States Federal Government being concerned about DeFi as a national security threat is obviously not the most bullish thing imaginable. They totally always embrace technological innovation quickly and without question. If ETH was truly as disruptive (and lucrative) as we‚Äôve all been suspecting the United States Federal Government certainly wouldn‚Äôt be raising an eyebrow at it. No sir. 

Sell it all. ETH isn‚Äôt just a security. It a mega-doodoo scary evil security that is also a shitcoin of no importance and will clearly go to 0.

<summary>u/charitablechair sees web 2 thinking in airdrops</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ci7az9/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2024/l28airo/)

After the EIGEN token announcement (and subsequent backlash) I've been thinking a lot more about how so much in the world of crypto right now seems to be the product web2 thinking i.e. VC money, financialized governance, etc etc.

One big plot hole with this web2 thinking, as I see it, is that it's really hard if not impossible to create a moat in crypto. Liquidity is never truly locked, vampire attacks are a thing, etc. etc. I personally believe that the crypto future that we were promised is not built on the back of for-profit, but rather autonomous public goods that are built and then kind've just put out into the world. Therefore this is a misalignment.

Adding to this rift is the fact that it seems VCs have figured out the crypto equivalent of the traditional [attract->extract](https://brandondonnelly.com/2018/02/19/attract-and-extract/) model. Since it is so hard to "turn a profit" in crypto, the main way to get paid is via this charade we call governance tokens. The attract cycle is building up TVL and hype, and the extract cycle is a user-hostile TGE and exit. This would explain...

1. Tiny and arbitrary allocations (5-10% for the community, airdrops for random NFT projects, etc.)
2. Opaque snapshot and TGE dates that of course insiders know beforehand
3. No withdrawal functionality until after TGE as a way of inflating TVL numbers (looking at you Renzo)
4. Non-transferable tokens (that is, until VCs are vested)
5. Arbitrarily limiting regions and putting serious effort into blocking VPNs 

The EIGEN announcement is of course disappointing, but in retrospect it's obvious that it would go this way.

The silver linining in all this is that once the dust settles we'll find that some things did get built with all this VC money after all. Those interested in creating public goods can take what's been built, clone it, and undercut it. Since I don't see a shift in how we fund crypto projects anytime soon, this is what I rest my optimism on.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal does their due diligence on the Swell L2</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ckjkf6/daily_general_discussion_may_5_2024/l2piabr/)

The other day, one of us asked if depositing assets into Swell L2 was safe.

I took a look today!

Swell L2 isn't live, so currently you're depositing into a staking contract. The code looks clean and intuitive.

If you deposit rebasing assets like eETH or stETH or plain ETH, your deposit is first routed through a zapper contract to convert it to weETH, wstETH or wETH.

The zapping contract is here: <https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd9fc4fdb07e46a69349101e862e82aa002ade0d#code>

There's no issue with this contract. It's immutable, no access control, everything is clearly defined.

Then in either case, your assets end up in the proper staking contract.

The staking contract is here: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x38d43a6cb8da0e855a42fb6b0733a0498531d774#code>

It's a simple contract with a couple functions. When your assets are inside this contract, they are dormant, not used for anything and not exposed to extra risk.

Only you can deposit and withdraw your assets. 

**EDIT: relevant update -> [u/ennui85](https://reddit.com/u/ennui85) points out the emergency function can't actually touch your deposits. That was a misread on my part.

This means the contract is 100% safe, much better than my "fairly safe" assessment.

-- end of original post below --

Save for one emergency function: the "owner" of this contract can withdraw the full balance of any allowed token inside the contract.

This "owner" leads to a Timelock: <https://etherscan.io/address/0xCa2DF225ba3c4743E02611EC423FaAC311dEEEd4#readContract>

The Timelock delay is set to 259200 seconds (3 days).

The "admin" of this Timelock leads to a 4-of-6 multisig: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x20fDF47509C5eFC0e1101e3CE443691781C17F90#readProxyContract>

Overall I'd rank this as "fairly safe" = less safe than Uniswap, but safer than PT/YT on Pendle and safer than money markets like Aave/Compound. 

The 3 days delay on owner withdrawals *should* be a guarantee against any wrongdoing, provided you assume between $500M of TVL some depositors will monitor the multisig (or do it yourself). The code is simple, in a good way, your assets simply sit in this contract. There is no upgrade function of any kind, presumably the bridging to Swell L2 will be an entirely manual process once it goes live (which is also a good thing).

[u/back_to_samadhi](https://reddit.com/u/back_to_samadhi):

Invested in Ethereum in the 2014 ICO. I have been away for a long time. I'm currently unwell and do not have the energy to try to get up to date, I barely understood how POW worked.

Whatever Ethereum is today, does it still have promise of building a new financial ecosystem and being the backbone of finance? Mass adoption will come if the correct/needed applications are being built.

But at a quick glance the space seems to be slightly empty, and all I see are airdrops and yield farming, when Ethereum and in general crypto has (had?) the potential to create a real revolution and change humanity.

Can someone direct me to good sources of information I could read or watch to catch up with what has been happening since 2021? As I said, I'm very unwell and do not have the mental sharpness or strength to go in depth right now...even if I want to.

Ever since August 2015 I've been following the ETHBTC ratio, and although I'm not worried, I am starting to think perhaps my timeline for seeing a ratio bull market is farther away than I had hoped...perhaps this still needs a few years. Or perhaps this is a retest of the ratio breakout from 2021 before moving higher.

But we need a catalyst, and airdrops along with yield farming won't cut it. Ethereum needs to prove that a new financial system is on the way before a bubble similar to the dot com bubble is possible. Perhaps that's here, hence I'm asking for information to help me build an objective narrative. Thanks, and bless you all with good health...its much more important than any of this.

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

After the latest update that made rollups economically viable, Ethereum is ready for primetime. The vision for a new, efficient and transparent backbone for finance that dis-intermediates middlemen is finally possible technically. Before we were limited to 10-20 transactions per second which is clearly insufficient to meet global settlement needs. Right now we have room for around 300-500 tps and the scalability roadmap will keep pushing it further to the order of 100K tps. 

The most significant roadblock right now is regulatory, the SEC and current US administration is very antagonistic of crypto and Ethereum in particular. But technology is unstoppable, once the genie is out it cannot be put back in. These hurdles will be overcome too.

If you have not been following you can hear it from the mouth of Blackrock's (biggest asset manager in the world) CEO himself. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTveRlW7QPo>

Wish you the best, take care of yourself.

[u/hblask](https://reddit.com/u/hblask):

I think people always look to the consumer/retail side to see if Ethereum is living up to its potential, but I think that is a mistake. I think the real potential is in the commercial side of things, such as the stuff Paul Brody is doing with EY.   Just google "Paul Brody EY Nightfall".  There are tons of videos.

The tl;dr is: EY is working on a set of business tools for supply chain tracking, so that companies can track every input and output of the supply chain from raw materials to consumer. Additionally, companies can ask for bids over the blockchain, award contracts, track performance, and do all the necessary accounting and payments.

They thought it would take about a decade to really build momentum -- like turning a battleship, you need a lot of lead time.  I believe we are about halfway through that, and many companies are trying it and starting the transition.

The "regulation by enforcement" is so frustrating. You cant seriously tell me Coinbase, Uniswap and Metamask are the bad guys in crypto.. when so much blatant insider trading, pump and dumps every single day. It suggests that there is just some ulterior motive 

Robinhood is one of the largest non-crypto companies to get into crypto in a big way (I mean for retail they have wallet/dex, and please the BTC ETF doesn really count in this), and now they are being sued. This is just intimidation and send a message to rest of the companies that if you get into crypto, you will be sued

Its no wonder no other big company has even tried. Last cycle there was genuine hope that companies will push into crypto. Nike, Coke, many played around with NFTs. Reddit came up with tokens. This cycle many more were gonna experiment....but now do you think a big company like Apple or Google will launch even a crypto wallet? If they dont know they are going to be charged as a "broker dealer" or "clearing agent" or "unregistered security" or whatever 

Its just to kill crypto .... Its all part of the agenda to stifle any growth of crypto

Infinite Jungle podcast by Christine Kim (she used to do the tweetstorms after each ACD call back in the day) is easily my top podcast on the Ethereum ecosystem lately. Beats out the Daily Gwei which was my previous must-listen

There's two 30min episodes a week, the first which covers what the core devs decided in the previous week's ACDC/ACDE call, and the second which interviews someone from the Ethereum ecosystem. 

The best part is she has a way of explaining hard to understand concepts almost like a school teacher - I've learned so much about account abstraction, Verkle tries, the EVM, EOF etc, even despite having a rough understanding of these areas already.

<summary>u/llamachef shares a cool product they have been using since ETHDenver</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cm3wej/daily_general_discussion_may_7_2024/l2z31wi/)

EthDenver follow up regarding Exponential.Fi, which was one of the stalls in the hall and had an offer for those that signed up during EthDenver. The offer was for those that verified by the end of the gathering, deposited and held the investment for 60 days, those that deposited 1,000 USDC got 100, and a 10,000 deposit got 1,000. Just got passed the 60 day mark and got the offer paid out, so that's neat.

The Exponential product, in my view, is trying to make defi appear through a more traditional investment bank wrapped. You login, do the KYC and all, and can either deposit from your Bank through Bridge or send via an Eth wallet, on mainnet, Arb, Polygon, and others, and you can send Eth or usdc. Once deposited you are presented with a variety of portfolios and projected APRs to invest in, denominated in currencies like eth, BTC, stables or some alts. They have pretty charts and stuff, and easy to understand descriptions of what's being invested in and the risk (and I just found you can click on "Full Report" to get a detailed breakdown, like quality of code, usage, reliability and more, and links to the actual defi site and a discord to discuss), like USDC-Across bridging, the Arb TriCrypto, etc . Pretty easy to invest into something, isn't instant like defi, I suspect they delay a day or two to try and batch transactions. Once invested it shows your average return and projected, again with charts and percentages. Pretty slick overall.

I like the product for a couple reasons. First, it keeps (and kept) me from doing wilder defi things because I knew I had to invest for the 60 days. It also allows automatic reinvesting of profits, like a traditional investment fund. Will probably keep my investments there since it pretty much was funded with eth profit taking. It's a very nice site and I don't need to be doing lots of wallet approvals and transactions to do anything. I'm assuming the tax report will be pretty nice when the time comes. And hey, they followed through on their 60 day promise of a USDC reward and I can't be sad with free USDC. 

Cons, though not super cons I guess. KYC with ID, so very tradfi. Also, for some reason you can only withdraw in the same amount as you deposited, you can't divide it up, which is weird cause I can do that with stocks and the like. So I've got the ability to withdraw my whole initial deposit, or my profits. The fee page says they can take up to 1%, when I looked at mine it said 0.2%, so a positive in understanding the fees involved, but no variability for onchain gas or timing to make it cheaper.

Not shilling (the majority of my defi is still via wallets), but just think it's a good way to take defi into the tradfi space.

Good day EthFinance,   
  
I would like to share a new initiative: The [Ethereum Defense Alliance](https://ethereumdefensealliance.com/). So what is the Ethereum Defense Alliance or EDA?

>We are a group of individuals and entities with the goal of protecting Ethereum against risk vectors and fostering a robust and sustainable network.

The EDA was initiated last year when the threat of Lido was even greater than it is today and as you all know it has evolved since then. Some EthFinance members like u/hanniabu, u/bob-rossi, u/minimalgravitas and myself are EDA Stewards and we are trying to coordinate people and ideas. There are already many more members and entities that have joint the EDA. 

We saw the power of coordination and importance of governance to protect the network. The EDA‚Äôs mission is protect Ethereum from centralization and risk vectors in every shape of from through:

* Collaboration: As the saying goes, ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù. We aim to bring together individuals, projects, and organizations from across the ecosystem to promote positive change as a united front.
* Education: Knowledge about decentralization pitfalls and their common causes is important to prevent the community at large from falling into them. This is our first (and possibly best) defense against risk vectors.
* Governance: Project governance can have influential effects on the rest of the network. The EDA contains delegates from key projects who will prioritize and advocate for chain health.
* Monitoring: We are developing tools and resources to actively monitor threats to Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization to catch issues early.
* Change: Once a threat has been identified, we look to spread awareness to the broader Ethereum community for swift course correction.

We believe this community understands the risks as well. Basically the search for delegates is/ was already one of the EDA's initiatives. But governance is only a means to an end and there is obviously more than that. We are looking forward to your input. The goal is to become even more proactive and drive changes before threats even show up. If you have any questions, you can post them here, contact one of us or use the contact form on the [EDA homepage](https://ethereumdefensealliance.com/).

Even if there are bipartisan pro-crypto agreements in congress, Biden is prepared to veto it according to a press release from the White House today on one such potential agreement that is being voted on later today. Is this how democracies should work?

Basically, the SEC issued guidelines (SAB 21) that banks, brokers-dealers, and many other entities can't custody digital assets. They did so without first asking for comments or coordinating with other agencies. 

See link below for full reasons given why they want to nullify the SEC SAB 21. It is a good brief read that makes sense to me. Risks are also bigger if all custody is concentrated to Coinbase.

Guys, I am absolutely in favor of trying out new stuff, that's perfectly fine and normal (and somehow incentivized). But please keep in mind: If you have no idea what the protocol or asset really does, you probably don't understand the risks. 

I am saying this today because of the liquidations yesterday and some questions in today's daily, but I was already very surprised some months ago when some members here deposited (rather large sums of) ETH into Eigenlayer without understanding what it does, what this deposit does (or does not) do with your ETH, timelines, etc. 

You all are obviously free to do stuff with your money, this is a permittionless industry, but I am a conservative boomer that cares for you. I don't want you to lose money, because you fucked around and found out. You can lose money, we probably all do from time to time. But don't risk too much of your stack in protocols and assets you don't understand, for unclear upsides. 

In a bull market you literally have one goal: Keep your ETH. The problem in a bull market. They all want your ETH. If you part with it, do so after spending some time really understanding what you're doing and getting yourself into. 

Boomer Bearnido out.

<summary>u/haurog shares a big disappointment</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cdcy19/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2024/l1bzi7o/)

Let me ramble about my biggest disappointment from the last year which is Eigenlayer.

When I first heard about it, the concept was a bit difficult to grasp. Once I started grokking it my mind was blown. Decentralized trust, where validators can start to run various services along their nodes and they can make truth statements about the world. It would lead to a world where we would be getting independent of centralized truth brokers. Projects could easily and trustlessly tap into the decentralized Ethereum network and start, for example, a decentralized oracle without having to kick start such a network on their own. It could even encourage the decentralization of the Ethereum network by giving small home stakers a better revenue than centralized operators as decentralization would have a value. Rainbows and unicorns everywhere. Obviously, I filled some of the gaps in my understanding and Eigenlayers very minimal docs with the best possible outcome.

Last autumn when I first saw the requirements for running the first AVS which is EigenDA, I realized that is not something just any node operator will be able to run on their node. Their delegated stake requirements made the problem even worse such that only a selected few operators will be able to run the EigenDA AVS.

Now, with EigenDA mainnet release, we have a few powerful entities like etherfi and other LRT providers which are the king makers in the protocol apparently having bilateral agreements with AVSs to make sure they can get the most profitable deals. The AVS operators have pretty much nothing at stake. If they loose money, they loose the money of the restakers, and meat space legal agreements will be the only thing keeping them in compliance. Not sure this is enough to be honest. All in all it is not much better than if projects outsource running their services to a service provider which will run stuff on a data center somewhere. The restaked assets were historically meant to be ETH on the beacon chain, which would directly map operators to their stake. Now, a large part is just 'restaked' LSTs and as far as I understand it soon could be any token. This is a far cry from the original vision. Not sure if it is good enough to even be long term profitable for restakers considering the nothing at stake risk for AVS operators.

EDIT: I love all the different takes and nuances. Thank you.

[u/Fast_Contract](https://reddit.com/u/Fast_Contract):

"Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman¬†Gary Gensler¬†said Thursday that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that allow holders to ‚Äústake‚Äù their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security. Known as the Howey test, it examines whether investors expect to earn a return from the work of third parties."

I wouldn't say eth fits into that since you don't gain anything from just holding it in a wallet, but Reth and steth certainly do.

[u/Set1Less](https://reddit.com/u/Set1Less):

I think that a court if presented with the right facts, will find that a pure proof of stake consensus mechanism like ETH 2.0 does not infact satisfy the howey test, because there is no demonstrable common enterprise that is built into the protocol. Solo stakers who earn rewards from staking do so, not because another party does the work and they earn their share from others work, but because they put in the effort themselves and whatever rewards they earn are the results of their own work

I remain pretty confident that if this matter goes before a court, the court will have no option but to rule that proof of stake consensus mechanism by itself does not violate howey's rule. 

If it comes to other staking mechanisms like delegated proof of stake or liquid staking, then there could be various entities playing the common enterprise role. But in a pure pos mechanism, there is none. The rewards are baked into the network - like new issuances to fund the staker rewards, sync committee rewards etc. 

If SEC were to make this claim in a court, I would be ultra bullish on a highly likely defeat for the SEC. Crypto companies arent exactly fucking around either, both Coinbase and Consensys have got the best law firm in USA to represent them, the calibre of lawyers is 2 or 3 leagues better than the muppets at SEC

New Etherscan feature launched called Cards, in a special section. One shows unclaimed airdrops. It seems to be a cooperation with Bankless. I found it still listed STRK despite me already claiming and it didn't give the ETHFI airdrop so it might not be 100%, but still pretty nice. Especially if you have multiple wallets, you can check them easily.

It also shows blockchain messages and token approvals - pretty nifty. Anyone can apply to Etherscan in a form with their project and they might consider it as a card, if it's useful enough.

The gov is basically arguing that smart contracts are money transmitter businesses and should KYC users and run a BSA program.

This is real bad.

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

I went over it quickly but I have a hard time to take them seriously when there are obviously in bad faith arguments. Let me pick the one that most quickly jumped to me while I was scrolling through.

At some point they make this argument:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*28WThvi_V_FX36kOhsKRvg.png)

And they go on a long tirade to argue against it as provably false. But the complete opposite is true. It's a provably true argument. After EIP-1559, transacting on Ethereum necessitates ETH, this is completely unavoidable. The argument Consensys is using basically boils down to, to use the Ethereum network ETH is necessary. Going after ETH, kills the possibility to use the network. And this is true, even if you assume all the fancy goodies of account abstraction. Someone needs to pocket the ETH to transact on Ethereum, either the end-user or the wallet provider with account abstraction. Now let's look at the arguments:

> Can I install a fresh instance of MetaMask in my browser or as an app & generate a fresh Ethereum address with no ETH? ‚úÖ

Not a transaction settlement.

> Can I go to EthCC or wherever & get a cool POAP dropped to this Ethereum address with no ETH? ‚úÖ

LOL, not a user transaction settlement. But someone is paying for that use of the network. If they kill ETH through regulatory maneuvers I can assure you, you will not be getting a POAP or anything in the US.

> Can I login, check-in, connect to cool blockchain dapps, sites, friends, and spaces with my ETHless EOA that has my new POAPs on it, to maybe get more POAPs, or just to browse, or whatever? ‚úÖ

Not transactions on the network. And the POAP argument was just covered.

>Can I sign messages & authorizations & authentications with my ETHless EOA? ‚úÖ

Not transactions on the network.

> Heck, can I sign contracts with my ETHless EOA? ‚úÖ

I start to see a pattern here. 100 ways to say I can still sign stuff with my public key. Everything except actually using the network which is the argument Consensys was making.

>Can I be served with legal process to my ETHless EOA? ‚úÖ

?

>Do at least some of these interactions constitute ‚Äútransactions on the blockchain‚Äù? ‚úÖ

Absolutely not. They are not transactions on the network. To transact on the network you must spend ETH, this is unavoidable after EIP-1559. EIP-1559 is what made ETH a commodity in the most literal sense. Is the commodity you consume to settle computation on a global settlement layer. Signing something with a public key is not using the Ethereum network. It's not propagated nor settled on the network.

> Do people do things like this onchain ü¶ä and irl, even without ETH? ‚úÖ

?

> Is this legally significant? ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

Dunno if it's legally significant but it is factually wrong.

EDIT: And to clarify why I think this article is written in bad faith. Whoever wrote it understands well enough the technology to very meticulously choose a niche use case of your public key (i.e. you can use it to sign messages) and conflate that with transacting on the network which is not. There is a lot of intent in whoever built this argument to confuse things, they are arguing for US-based users to not be able to use the Ethereum network, period. And they are willing to twist reality to get there.

Instead it's VCs building yet another level of financial engineering just because they can. So aside from some less hype-y DePIN projects, a small selection of aligned L2s, teams working on FHE and other core values related projects, I'm getting pretty over this all. I look forward to the day where I can cash out at my target price and just perpetually stake my only validator node to do my part in keeping the decentralised vision alive.

<summary>u/austonst digs into the EigenLayer token whitepaper</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cgkmut/daily_general_discussion_april_30_2024/l1wf60r/)

I actually never put funds into any sort of EigenLayer restaking; while I was always interested in the concept, the points system and insane levels of hype for an unreleased protocol triggered some circuit breakers in my brain and I just couldn't let myself participate materially. So congrats to those with access to a good amount of EIGEN, and my condolences to those who feel rugged by the distribution parameters and/or geographical/IP blocking.

The more interesting topic for me is the release of the [EIGEN token whitepaper](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf). The authors present EIGEN as having a critical role in restaking and I'd like to try to break it down a little.

# Staking Faults

Restaking provides economic security to AVSs through the threat of slashing deposited collateral. If you (or more specifically, your delegated operator) follow the rules, you get paid. If you break the rules, you get slashed. But under the hood, slashing rules are encoded into smart contracts, and preferably the logic isn't just "the AVS devs have complete power at any time to choose who to slash". The contracts can be smarter than that.

##### Objective Faults

The paper looks at two different categories of *faults*, the bad things that would trigger slashing. These are *objectively attributable* and *intersubjectively attributable* faults. Objective faults are the more straightforward of the two. This is where the contract can directly verify that the fault occurred. Think of double signing: the contract can easily check that yes, the same private key did sign two different conflicting messages, and therefore committed a fault. Fraud and validity proofs can also fall under this category: someone does something malicious, someone else creates a SNARK proving it was wrong, the contract verifies it, and slashing occurs.

These are not always easy or possible to implement for an AVS, but detection and resolution of these faults is straightforward. EigenLayer with restaked ETH is perfect for this.

##### Intersubjective faults

Intersubjective faults occur when there is a generally agreed upon truth but it is not mathematically provable on-chain. The standard example is price oracles. The contract doesn't know what's happening in the real world. We can all agree that the current market price of ETH is ~$3200, but the contract has to find some way to get a price feed from a source it can trust. Maybe that would be an AVS with a decentralized group of validators casting votes about the current price. The majority vote wins, so if the validator set is sufficiently decentralized, the correct price becomes a Schelling point.

If everyone says ETH market price is $3k but I cast a vote saying it's worth $10k, despite my number being much better, I'm not following the rules of the AVS. Anyone can look at actual market data and confirm that the price was actually $3k and that I'm in the wrong. But the contract itself can't objectively confirm that $3k is correct and $10k is wrong. So it's through agreement of the validator set, and my lone *dis*agreement, that determines that I have committed an *intersubjective fault*. Other potential sources of intersubjective faults include censorship resistance/detection, data availability, and as a stepping stone in verifiable computation before proving can be fully SNARKified.

##### Tyranny of the Majority

Identifying intersubjective faults through majority votes works well... as long as the majority is honest and can all agree on the truth. There are a few ways this can break down. First is when a malicious attacker gains control of a majority of votes: they can trick the system into accepting an incorrect truth, and simultaneously slash any honest validators. Bribes make this possibility scarier. Second is when the truth itself is ambiguous, and honest voters may come to different conclusions. Maybe we're giving Ethereum an oracle price feed of another chain's native token, and that chain undergoes a contentious fork; which fork's token price do we follow?

In the end, with the intersubjective on-chain voting mechanism having broken down, the system has to fall back on *social consensus*, usually implemented through forking. If a malicious majority is saying the market price of ETH is $1, the rest of the world knows that's wrong, so we'll come to off-chain social consensus to make a fork. The old system is abandoned, and at the social layer everyone agrees to move to the new fork, which likely introduces socially-agreed-upon state changes to slash the attacker and "unslash" any honest validators caught up in the attack. A forkable oracle could also do just that to mirror a fork in the tracked token.

##### Overloading Ethereum Consensus

So what happens in the case of EigenLayer when an attacker gains majority ETH control of an AVS with intersubjectively determined slashing conditions? We have *actual honest Ethereum validators* who could end up slashed and effectively (or literally, post-Pectra) booted from the Ethereum network. The social layer could come to the rescue again, but it would mean a hard fork of *Ethereum itself* to slash the malicious actors and restore the honest ones. 

Vitalik wrote a well known blog post on this subject, referring to the issue as the [overloading of Ethereum consensus](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html). One of the greatest risks is that we get a repeat of The DAO, where disagreement on if/how the social layer should resolve an application issue caused the Ethereum chain as a whole to fork. It's not too hard to imagine a situation where a large AVS gets intersubjectively attacked, an uncomfortable number of honest validators have their ETH slashed, and we once again have to decide between allowing some harm to the health of the network, or forking on behalf of a broken application. We really don't want to find ourselves in a position where we have to seriously have that debate again, and EigenLayer needs to be careful to not enable that.

# The EIGEN Token

The paper talks about social consensus from the perspective that tokens/projects have certain social conditions agreed upon during their initial *setup phase* that determine how to resolve intersubjective faults later on. Bitcoin's community agreed on the longest chain rule for PoW consensus. Ethereum's community agreed on its fork choice rule as well, but with a stipulation that the goal would be to move to PoS, an important decision during the "setup phase" that eased the social acceptance of the transition. Rollups and national governments also follow this paradigm. EigenLayer's perspective is that allowing intersubjective restaking of ETH would be a violation of Ethereum's setup phase--citing the same Vitalik post. They argue that intersubjective restaking in general requires a very specific setup phase where the entire community engages with the token with a very specific set of expectations around its principles and intended use.

**So the answer:** Design the EIGEN token specifically for the purpose of universal intersubjective staking. Design all AVSs so that all objective faults are backed by ETH, and all intersubjective faults are covered by EIGEN. In case of a failure of the intersubjective systems that requires social intervention and forking, that will be handled through the EIGEN token's *own forking system* rather than overloading Ethereum's social consensus.

##### Two Token Model

EigenLayer actually envisions a system that contains two tokens, EIGEN and bEIGEN. I'm not going to go into full detail about the tokens and forking behavior, but I can provide an overview, specifically of their V1 design. bEIGEN (b is for "backing") is what is used internally within EigenLayer; it is what is actually staked with an operator and may be forked into different versions over time to resolve issues at the social layer. EIGEN abstracts that complexity away for the purposes of DeFi, providing a token that can be used without worrying about the forks going on behind the scenes.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cgkmut/daily_general_discussion_april_30_2024/l1wf81q/)

##### bEIGEN

bEIGEN forking is pretty interesting. An intersubjective fault can still result in slashing, as usual, but each AVS must implement a system by which anyone can raise an alarm about a fault to suggest that there is a need for social consensus to resolve a dispute. If there is an issue, e.g. attacker controlling majority stake, a challenge can be raised in the form of an ERC20 contract fork of the bEIGEN token. So you end up with the old pre-forked bEIGEN1 and new post-fork bEIGEN2. bEIGEN1 holders can claim their bEIGEN2 for a limited time.

In order to raise a challenge, the challenger must burn a significant amount of bEIGEN1--this is the cost to them if their challenge turns out to be incorrect and bEIGEN1 remains canonical. The challenger must also tag a sufficient amount of bEIGEN2 tokens as malicious, these will be burned in bEIGEN2, and punish the attacker if the challenger is correct and bEIGEN2 becomes canonical. Once both tokens exist, the social layer takes over and through market price discovery, adoption of the tokens by AVSs and other protocols, etc, decides which token is correct and canonical.

Through this method, the need for a social layer to intervene in some intersubjective faults can be realized. Ideally, AVSs are designed to minimize ambiguity about which fork would be correct if you just check the real-world source of truth. So in most cases it should be obvious. But it's probably unavoidable that some will be contentious, those will be more fun to watch play out and I'll be glad Ethereum validators aren't at risk.

Technical note: the reason why bEIGEN2 redemptions are limited-time is because it needs to be shorter than the withdrawal time in order to prevent an attacker from committing a fault, withdrawing, and claiming the bEIGEN2 tokens anyway. By having `t_redeem < t_withdraw`, the attacker has no way to get around their punishment. This carries the unfortunate design issue of putting a limit on redemption time. bEIGEN holders who delay may see all their value evaporate.

##### EIGEN

The EIGEN token is designed to be insulated from all that, because imagine what a nightmare that would be for DeFi integrations. Anyone with bEIGEN can wrap it to become EIGEN. The EIGEN contract provides its own governance to follow the various forks of bEIGEN and swap its contents to reflect its view of the canonical bEIGEN token. When unwrapping, it will only ever return the bEIGENx it considers canonical, not any other others. In short, if you hold EIGEN, you are trusting its governance system to accurately follow the canonical fork and in exchange don't have to worry about the forks yourself. The obvious risk is that if governance is wrong or corrupt, you may end up holding junk.

##### V2 Tokens

The big change in their proposed V2 is that the EIGEN contracts become immutable, and so must also be forked to create a EIGENx to match each bEIGENx. This creates a sort of historical record of the fork history through the various contracts, which gives EIGENx holders the option to hold passively and later claim all the bEIGEN tokens along the fork history, while protecting them from malicious EIGEN governance.

This seems to hurt the DeFi usage of the token, as each EIGENx will remain its own tradeable token. I think only the most recent EIGENx will be used, as it's the only one that could be actively wrapped from bEIGENx, so that would mean DeFi protocols would have to add each new EIGENx as they come out. But it's still much more convenient than using bEIGEN in DeFi. At least with EIGEN there's no pressure to redeem forks immediately; with bEIGEN if you don't manage to untangle it from nested DeFi positions and redeem forks in time you're screwed.

# Conclusion and Thoughts

The big thing here is that ETH restaking will only be used as economic security for objective faults, while (b)EIGEN provides economic security for intersubjective faults. Intersubjective faults often require social consensus to resolve through a fork (e.g. The DAO) and can sometimes be contentious. So the biggest benefit of this system is that the Ethereum social consensus layer is not pressured to fork the chain in order to resolve issues with an AVS. Without this there's a really good chance that a too-big-to-fail AVS would eventually get attacked and Ethereum would face a difficult decision about whether to fork to protect the honest stakers caught up in the incident, possibly bad enough to create an Ethereum Classic 2.0.

##### What is EigenLayer Actually?

The biggest downside to me is the breakdown of EigenLayer as an ETH **RE**staking platform. Anyone can deploy a smart contract through which you can stake an ERC20 token as collateral and earn rewards for computational services while taking on slashing risk in case of misbehavior. A general marketplace for buying and selling economic security, kinda neat.

EigenLayer is particularly interesting in that it uses ETH (which is possibly the world's best collateral asset), and all of the ETH it has access to for security is also actively involved in regular ETH validator duties. For me it feels like there's a fundamental difference there. That having your AVS's economic security come from the same ETH that's securing the network feels like you're sharing in that same security, like you're tapping into a particularly valuable, established set of actors. Ethereum validators are already committed to locking up their ETH to earn rewards, if EigenLayer makes it easy to access the same set of actors, you know you're  able to easily source high quality economic security for any project that's willing to pay for it, rather than bootstrapping a validator set from scratch.

EIGEN isn't "restaking", it's just... staking. To be fair, it's a token designed to be the best universal intersubjective staking token, allows delegators to provide security to numerous shifting AVSs simultaneously, and will have tooling around it to make it easy for AVSs to adopt. So it's the basis for a nice market for economic security for anyone who wants to buy or sell it. But in my mind it loses that critical edge that ETH has.

If EigenLayer dropped ETH altogether and EIGEN were used as the sole medium of exchange for economic security in their marketplace, I feel like I'd hesitate to use it. Wouldn't you? To some extent I feel like EigenLayer gained a lot of prominence specifically because of the ETH restaking direction, and it's a bit of a light rugpull to say "now that you've gotten on board, you have to buy our token in order to use half of our system". Maybe it helps that the airdrop goes in part to ETH stakers who followed the incentives, making it easier for them to participate in both aspects? And maybe this is a necessary tradeoff to avoid overloading Ethereum consensus; there's no other way?

##### Other Thoughts

Regardless of the above, I think it's clear that EIGEN as a staking token is a riskier play for EigenLayer than ETH restaking. It means a notable increase in complexity and risk factors. The system described in the paper is in no way simple to design or implement. And this token's close integration with critical staking systems means Ethereum as a whole has more risk exposure to Eigen Labs. Should we be putting more work into protocolizing EigenLayer in the same way that we're working towards ePBS? In taking this step, EL further invite this discussion.

I have been a little frustrated with the rough state of AVSs at this point in EigenLayer's launch, and how few of them have really described what slashing is going to look like (despite them being literally live on mainnet!). This announcement does explain it somewhat: AVSs are going to have to factor EIGEN and intersubjective faults into their designs, so it would have been unfair to expect them to develop their slashing mechanisms before this was described in detail. So cool, maybe they can work on their economics now finally. But at the same time... why the heck did EigenLayer deploy to *mainnet* before this info was released? Why?

I haven't really done a deep dive on the theory of forking tokens, so I can't really analyze that too deeply. But I have always thought it's a cool idea, and enjoy reading about governance systems designed with forking as a central concept, e.g. The DAO, Nouns DAO. The paper draws comparisons to Augur's REP token but doesn't list others that really fork an application's utility token. So this may actually be pretty novel, EigenLayer is huge and their forking system is very likely to be stress tested by malicious actors. I'm very curious to see how it plays out.

##### ty

And I guess that's that. The paper is 43 pages, so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad that this ended up so long. Always happy to explain more details from what I understood of the paper. And even happier to get corrections and different perspectives.

<summary>u/Set1Less sheds some light into why projects are geoblocking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1chdtev/daily_general_discussion_may_1_2024/l249d29/)

One of the CT resident lawyers  did a thread on all this yesterday. I'd suggest anyone having these questions to go through that 

TLDR is that these are all legal issues. Its not that the project says lets take their money and defraud people or lets block US, that is a good idea for us.. No. 

Its all down to legal constraints, and projects trying to waddle through unclear regulations, protecting them from potential government charges. Projects tell users, infact make it very clear from the very start not to expect airdrops for the same reason - they dont want to trick people into thinking they are going to airdrop, but end up not airdropping few countries or jurisdictions because of sanctions or regulations. So they make it very clear there isnt gonna be an airdrop. If someone files a lawsuit - they can just point to the message posted 12 months ago in discord #Wen-token channel that says dont expect an airdrop. 

Similarly, the locked is also locked to make the token appear decentralized from the start. There is a belief that a locked token has less chances of being labelled a security (since it has no value), so the project is airdropping a locked token. And they will want the community to create proposals to unlock it, add value to it 

No doubt, for end users its painful - you locked $50k for 6 months only to find out you arent eligible and the whole country is blocked. At that point you are mad, and dont want to hear "legal thingies". But the bitter pill is that all of this is due to not just unclear regulations but potential regulatory actions against projects/founders. US users must consider that there is a high chance they will be ineligible for most airdrops. So either they should not farm airdrops or acquaint themselves with gud airdrop claim technology (VPNs that work) 

Of course, one will say that XYZ project 2 years ago airdropped us, and didnt do all this, you guys suck. Again the fact is that now the times have changed, regulatory environment has worsened. If you follow what is going on for the last 24 months, its kinda obvious... 

Coming to Ryan from Bankless - I really dont envy his job of trying to explain all this to a crowd of people who think they've been sold short.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c6v2o5/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2024/l03ooit/)

Looking for a list or some comparison of safe Eigenlayer operators to delegate to. Any help?

I see Aestus mentioned here but not familiar with their background.

EigenYields seems sketchy upon further inspection. 

Etherfi has like 8 different operators, but are they all the same?

I also see Staked.US and they seem to have a good track record, but they shut out Americans from airdrops so how would that work if you‚Äôre an American restaker? 

Or, is it best to just wait until some of the larger exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken get in on the game?

<summary>u/STRTRD is doing the lord's work reaching out to large staking providers still using the (almost) supermajority client.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c6v2o5/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2024/l06nlme/)

(Reposting since reddit deleted last post because of links.)

Few weeks ago when finding of Geth bug was posted here I decided to contact top 11 majority-Geth/undisclosed staking operators listed on supermajority info (having 1% and more network penetration)

I presented myself as a current/potential user, concerned about client supermajority issue, asking about their current setup and potential plans to improve client diversity status.

Contact was made through emails, customer support or Discord. Here are the summaries of respones I recieved:

* Binance: We understand the concerns around supermajority usage and its impacts on network security and user funds. While we are devoted to ensuring the highest level of security for our users, as a standard security practice, we do not disclose specifics about our internal infrastructure including Ethereum validator client details. This policy is in place to shield our operations and safeguard user assets. However, we take threats to network security seriously and continuously improve our infrastructure in response to evolving industry developments and security principles. Diversifying into minority clients is indeed a recognized method to spread risk and enhance security. Rest assured, we have expert teams constantly observing the ecosystem and shaping our approach.
* Kraken: We would be unable to discuss any exact details of how we manage Ethereum client diversity, one of which is indeed GETH. Kindly note however, we are acutely aware of the benefits to the chain and for our own risk mitigation that client diversity brings, as such we do have strategies in place to this effect.
* OKX: Kindly be informed that¬†OKX¬†uses supermajority execution clients and we are unable to provide any confirmation on plans to diversify to minority ones as this decision requires the approval of a significant majority of stakeholders or participants to proceed.
* Bitcoin Suisse: "At present,¬†Bitcoin¬†Suisse¬†primarily employs GETH for our execution layer nodes, as you've noted. We're in the process of evaluating the use of an additional node provider besides GETH. However, we're proceeding cautiously to ensure a seamless transition, prioritizing stability and security considerations." They are now listed with 90% Geth, 10% Besu.
* RockX: no response, Discord
* Blockdaemon: no response, sent inquiry on their site, got forwarded to email, then email forwarded me back to site
* Hash Key Cloud: no response, site form
* Prysmatic Labs: Yes we are in the process of testing Nethermind on our setups. This takes a while as we need to have reasonable confidence in testnets before moving on to mainnet.
* Chainsafe: "Almost there. We are doing some extended testing on a small group of mainnet validators right now and will roll out the rest of them later this week if there are no issues." Also this tweet suggests that they are 30% Nethermind instead of 26% listed on supermajority: "The Lodestar and Infrastructure teams currently run 30% of our validators with and will continue to increase this alongside inclusion of ."
* Kukis Global: "We will update our stats on supermajority info¬†soon, we are currently close to 60% Nethermind and 40% Geth and will go towards 0% Geth this year." Indeed, they are listed at 50% now.
* Figment: no response, made contact as a potential user, still waiting

I think Binance, Kraken and OKX (8% combined) should be campaigned further through social media and other channels to ensure they make an action. It seemed to be effective with Coinbase, we saw Brian Armstrong responded personally to DC on twitter, it also worked with consensus clients.

Many smaller operators seem to be steadily working towards diversifying, but feel free to check up on them as well.

Community did bring awareness to the problem and it improved, we can get it to 50% or below.

<summary>u/KuDeTa is looking to hire an Ethfinancier as a DevOps engineer for Aestus!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c7okhx/daily_general_discussion_april_19_2024/l0af6kk/)

The [Aestus MEV Relay](https://aestus.live) is [hiring](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/engineering/aestus-mev-and-staking-devops-engineer/) a DevOps Engineer.

Frankly when u/austonst and I started this projected \~20 months ago, we both imagined (hoped?) it would have become irrelevant by now. However, ePBS is an unsolved research problem that even optimistically feels years away from any kind of resolution. So - we intend to set things up to play a long term game. We still think it's crucial to the long term health of Ethereum that credibly neutral players occupy this space - because MEV is an incredible centralising force.

We've recently received some funding from an Optimism retro PGF round, which ethfinancers were instrumental in supporting. So, it's because of the fine work from people like u/superphiz and u/bendido2030 that we are in a position to hire at all. It would be great to return that trust by sourcing someone close to this community.

The ad suggests this is a full-time role, but we're very open to *committed* part-time contributions ‚Äî and this could be a fun, albeit intense, side-gig for someone. Your primary role will be to help us improve the performance and stability of our existing architecture and develop a plan for the future. The right person will have very strong cloud and k8s experience in domains including observability and security. Generalist coding capability, a willingness to absorb new information and learn new skills are also essential. You'll also be part of an on-call rota.

This work brings you very close to the core Ethereum protocol and part of your job will to be stay on top of research and developments in the MEV and ePBS space. While for me the most exciting part of this project has been in the constant adventure of working at the bleeding edge - there are many unknowns - and that also means that whoever we hire will have to accept a bit of insecurity. Having said that, the additional capacity will allow us to spend more time exploring new services and opportunities both in the relay ecosystem and beyond - restaking and shared-sequencing are both ecosystems where we think our ethos and experience can make a difference.

Worth also noting that unfortunately and for complicated reasons, we can't hire anyone resident in the US. I hope i'm not breaking any rules by posting this here!

<summary>u/haurog shares some scams targeting him lately and u/austonst educates us on the latest evolution</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c7okhx/daily_general_discussion_april_19_2024/l09nkij/)

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

A very good indication that we are in a bull market is the pick up of the various scam attempts I come across. A few weeks ago my cold wallet on Ethereum was getting spammed with address poisoning attacks. Cost the spammer several dollars for each poisoning. I cannot really believe that these kind of things are worth it for them, but apparently they are ready to spend real money to do it. 

Then came a cold DM on telegram from someone wanting to borrow my github account for a day. I blocked them so I never found out what they actually wanted with it, but I guess they saw my github account in the list of some airdrops and they would have wanted to claim them. 

Yesterday I got DMs on Discord and Telegram with freelance coding job opportunities. These are close to 100% a scam as well. At the moment I am talking to them to try to find out how they would want to scam me. The slightly worrying part about the DMs is that they feel a bit closer to me than address poisoning. Especially, when these messages have been sent on two different apps (discord and telegram) simultaneously. Seems like someone is adding my user name to their scamming database.

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst):

I've got an addition to /u/haurog 's [scam watchlist](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c7okhx/daily_general_discussion_april_19_2024/l09nkij/) from yesterday. My more valuable wallets have been getting hit with address poisoning attacks, which at this point I would hope most people here are familiar with. And this should *really* be addressed with better tools at the wallet/etherscan level.

But more interestingly, my personal cell phone was hit today with a text message:

> COINBASE: An unauthorized device from Salt Lake City, Utah has logged into your Coinbase account. If this was not authorized by you, please reply with "N". If this was authorized by you ignore this message.

I caught on immediately, in part because I wasn't actually sure I *have* a Coinbase account (I checked, and I do, but I didn't even really complete account setup, never set it up to receive fiat or crypto funds). But also because I had just recently read [this article on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/lastpass-users-targeted-in-phishing-attacks-good-enough-to-trick-even-the-savvy/), which describes the abilities of the CryptoChameleon phishing-as-a-service toolkit. It's a really good read, would recommend. But the first step of one of CryptoChameleon's techniques is described to be similar: a phone call telling the recipient that there was an unauthorized login and asking them to press "1" or "2" to accept or deny.

This is kind of tricky because there's not really any immediate danger in replying "N" (or pressing "2" to deny). If it's legit then you've done your part to prevent an attack. If it's not legit, then all you've done is sent a pointless text message. And users have become increasingly used to dealing with these kinds of messages from all sorts of account logins, so it may not ring any alarm bells. Why not send a quick "N" and be done with it?

But my understanding is that the first step of a scam is by far the most important. On one hand, some scams deliberately use dubious sounding claims (Nigerian prince, anyone?) as an initial filter, so that the savvy users weed themselves out, and the people who actually respond are more likely to be duped by the subsequent requests. But that's probably just a side-benefit here, maybe allowing the recipients without Coinbase accounts to filter themselves out. And it's notable that this message asks for action to deny and a non-response to approve. The vast majority of legit messages of this kind are the other way around: silence means deny. And that's smart, that's the way it *should* be.

More relevant this time is a sort of a sunk cost fallacy. In the world of video games that are "free to play" but with microtransactions for additional bonuses, it's well understood that getting the user to make their first payment is a massive step. Once someone has caved and paid once, they're much more likely to continue to do so. And at some point you can ask me about the fascinating ways in which a scammer on the streets of Istanbul employed a bunch of tricks to make it really hard for me to disengage once we had started talking, but that's a longer story. But in short: if a scammer can get you to take the first step, you're much more likely to fall for the following steps. So in this case, having the first step be something so likely to get casual responses means a higher success rate as a whole.

If the CryptoChameleon playbook described by Ars is accurate, there would probably be a followup text or email with a link to a fake phishing Coinbase login page, ready to take my password. I would hope even if people fell for the first step, they'd catch the issue at this point, but the danger could be that the first step being fairly risk-free would cause people to let their guard down.

This turned out longer than I planned, hope it reads all right. *tl;dr*: Scams nowadays will likely start with "unauthorized device/login" messages, these kinds of messages should make you consider if the source could be a scammer.

> Can I accidentally sign something malicious and it then drains my wallet?

Yes, hackers can be very creative. You could lose all of a single token, or an NFT or even native ETH. Not more than one type or token per signature. 

I didn't think they could touch your ETH but just recently learned of a way. It uses eth_sign to have you sign a TX that the scammer generated in advance. It will only be valid for one nonce though. Basically, your private key has signed a TX that the scammer can create later, for example an ETH transfer. The wallets warn of those signature types heavily though. 

It is also possible to lose many NFTs at once. I don't completely understand it but I remember when some people lost multiple Apes/Punks a couple of years back in a signing scam. Below is an article on it. 

> "However, signing a message like the second or third image on a website that turns out to be a scam will grant the scammers contract (and linked wallet) the ability to literally just buy all your approved NFTs to the specified contract under the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù for ETH" -https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-gasless-signature-scam-heiner-garc√≠a-p√©rez-u0ice

It can be difficult to spot a scam because the UI in Metamask is often abysmal for signatures. It's a lot better in Rabby but even there sometimes it doesn't understand things. It can then look like, you are trading asset 0xCY45... for asset 0x567DF... at a price of 85000000 gwei. That's just ridiculous and easy to make a mistake on any of the contracts or even the amount might be a zero too much/little. I have read of people getting scammed this way. 

You should always be careful when signing. If you are some public crypto MVP with millions of USD, you should even be extra careful. Use a separate PC only for crypto. I read about someone at a crypto company that opened a job resume PDF, it had some kind of malware that affected his metamask to push a modified TX to his hardware wallet which drained the company of millions USD.

Separating wallets and having a multi-sig are good practices.

Logris got me very interested in FHE for the past few days. Thank you for sharing! The tech is super interesting as someone who consistently takes the long and dull path while navigating the internet to preserve privacy and reduce data-mining (even though I know that it doesn't change anything in the grand scheme). A bit surprised I didn't know about this technology before. Running algorithms over data without knowing the true input/output, while still knowing the validity of the computation is preserved, is mind-blowing, but also makes sense when looking a bit closer.  
  
In a utopian future, where this is the new standard for how the internet and its services work, I wonder how companies will keep serving you things like relevant ads and a personalized experience. Although I'd be more than happy to live in a world without these "features", the incentives are just so strong that it doesn't make sense for them to let them go willingly. Anyone have any thoughts about this?

It would be nice if it turned into a marketplace, where you get these things served blindly through the same mechanisms, and got compensated for doing so (Brave had a cool visionary idea like this, but didn't work out that well in practice). A less cool approach would be design-patterns for applications to gate-keep certain features, like premium services or exclusive content in exchange for users opting in to give their data.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard does a deep dive on freedom</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bveuv9/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2024/ky32izo/)

Let's take a moment to talk about *freedom*. Here in the US there's this point of national pride they try to imprint on you that the US was founded on principals of freedom and somehow spreads the torch of freedom around the world. There's the bill of rights they trot out, right to free speech etc. A pedantic point I sometime raise with people is that if something is discretionally permitted by the government, it is not a true freedom. Right to free speech? Not if you yell fire in a crowded room, start a riot, libel, slander, etc. If a judge *can* issue a gag order, speech itself is not a freedom; it is *permitted*. Driving is not a right; it is permitted. Owning a firearm is not a right, it is permitted, despite what all the 2A folks want to believe.

In terms of true freedoms, you have very few true ones and even amongst your permitted rights they are often being deprecated by technology. For example you had the right to privacy, the government couldn't open your USPS mail without a warrant. This is still technically true, but the vast majority of mail has instead become email and the US doesn't need a warrant to scry that. You had the freedom to transact with cash, but increasingly every payment is digital and those rights don't carry over. We hear frequently stories of people that go to deposit to a bank and have the deposit frozen. You have to report transactions over $10k, which practically means less and less expensive things in purchasing power each year due to inflation. Legislative inaction and judicial activism, in the face of technological progress, are eroding what few permitted freedoms we still have.

The notion that everything every citizen does should be permitted is attractive to those who wield power. They want you to have to ask their permission so they can say no and only permit actions that preserve or expand their position of power and at a time and place most convenient for them. The days tick by and the vice constraining what you are allowed to do silently tightens each day. The people who need freedoms the most are those with the most controversial ideas, the ones most likely to destabilize the status quo; for good or ill.

People like Warren fundamentally disagree with me on the freedom to transact. They want the freedom to transact to fully transition to a permitted freedom. They make arguments like "equal playing field" with the banks that are already wound in the straight jacket for them. They argue that the only people who need these freedoms are those with malicious intent. They reductively argue that blockchains are financing North Korea and child porn. Of course, they are only here to protect us. It's very much analogous to the "nothing to hide" arguments you get from the surveillance state encroaching on your right to privacy and it's every bit as ethically wrong. They couldn't be further from the founding principals of this nation if they tried.

Your transactions are an expression of your values. You invest in things you believe in, you buy things that add value to your life, you donate to causes you hold dear. Limiting your transactions is fundamentally an attack on your ability to express your values and shape the world to align with them. The moral compass of crypto is a controversial one, precisely because it bucks the trend and creates true freedom; for good or ill. So yes, there are scammers abound, memecoins with deliberately hateful content, and rugs every day but there are also people escaping the oppressive inflation of their nation state, financing art and innovation, and eroding the role parasitic middlemen plaguing our society.

So, asking for permission simply won‚Äôt do. I'd rather just be free.

<summary>u/Stobie explains token approvals</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bveuv9/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2024/kxzp0pn/)

approve() is part of the most common standard token interface, erc20. It has nothing to do with ethereum and is unrelated ethereum upgrades. Tokens can be any contract which implement any interface, or if you want they can all be from the same factory and you can check if they're in that factories mapping of built tokens if you want to be sure what they are.

There have always been tokens which do it differently but erc20 isn't going anywhere, you'll stop noticing it when account abstraction becomes standard. For example on starknet ethereum rollup where account abstraction is default the approve and function call all take place within a single tx. Same can be true with dapps which use dsproxy.

ERC 4337 is going to win and become account abstraction standard. I hate it but it'll be fine. Would rather hard fork and do it properly.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi has an $ARB delegate update and a $HOP delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bw9oqm/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2024/ky698gc/)

ARB DAO updates:

* I voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247/35) funding a team to work on a more user-friendly tool to bypass the sequencer when it is down. While admittedly the tech side is probably beyond my scope of knowledge, the broad concept I think is important enough to explore for decentralization purposes. 
* I tentatively voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368/145) the initial temp check of a $200M gaming fund to target gaming on Arbitrum. It seemed to have a lot of community support, although I indicated some changes I'd like to see if it went to a Tally vote. I'm torn... as I want to fund all types of projects to help Arbitrum grow, however I'm not super sold on blockchain gaming personally and I'd like to see more detail for a proposal of this size. We will see what the changes look like, but I'm probably leaning 'against' if unchanged and went to Tally today. 
* I voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387/34) Tally support to improve their governance page. All on-chain voting goes through Tally, so I look forward to their ideas and research into improving that process for both delegates but also people looking to delegate. The ideas presented should make it far easier to view delegate information, as well as increase transparency for those who vote. And I look forward to this one a lot!
* I voted ["Against"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/51) a proposal to continue temporary funding of any project that passed and showed success in the initial STIP phase. This would occur alongside the 3 month LTIP window. This was contentious, with a 61% approval, 31% against vote. My main concern, echo'd by others, was that there was no real data to conclude what qualified as a successful grant round or not. As such, this moves the grantspace backwards as it doesn't incorporate things we learned from the STIP / LTIP rounds. Additionally, I felt that the funds would be better used for a comprehensive and all-inclusive grant round after the 12 week LTIP has been completed. As at some point continually doing temporary, short grant rounds isn't a sustainable option. 

I'll also update everyone here that the March delegate incentive program data is out - [here](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-march-2024/23043). This is a trail program looking at ways to incentive delegates to participate more meaningfully in governance, rewarding active voting and discussion. I actually ended up being rank #1 out of all those who participated! Hopefully those who delegate to me here feel adequately represented :) and know that I try my best to make sure your voting power isn't wasted.

Quick HOP governance update. 

I've spent the last few months working on applying to the ARB Long-Term grant program on behalf of Hop, heading up a team with a few other HOP delegates. Council voting results have been [released](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/ltipp-council-screening-period-results/23029) (list of all passing projects here) and HOP has passed the first round! So now it goes to the ARB delegates for vote this week for final approval. 

The grant is asking for 500k ARB tokens with the goal of making bridging to the ARB networks cheaper for users. This will be done through fee rebates and liquidity incentives (to reduce slippage), and if it goes live should hopefully help users switch between L2 networks to take advantage of the growing space. 

I'll also add, I worked as well to apply for a similar grant through [Optimism](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/hop-protocol-05609313574623109). Hopefully with similar results.

<summary>u/interweaver looks into the different mentalities of people buying crypto</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bx39o4/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2024/kyenvwr/)

Like most of the rest of you, I sometimes ponder why Ethereum in recent years tends to perform so... differently... from many other cryptoassets out there.

I keep coming back to this one reason:

**Most people today buy crypto to gamble, not to invest.**

The market, broadly speaking, is not interested in fundamentals. It sees crypto as a giant casino, where if you're ~~lucky~~ better and faster at reading the trends and moods and narratives, you can become rich overnight, and escape the increasingly dystopian financial state of society. Fundamentals are not the bedrock of deciding what is and isn't a good deal, in this mentality - they are a ball and chain that keeps an asset tethered to reality, when what you actually want is one that is free to ascend into outer space with no pesky P/E ratios or highly technical upgrades to slow understanding and buzz. The more innocent an asset is of any practical use, the less beholden it therefore is to actually needing to support that use, to actually addressing that market, to actually *working*. If you're not *supposed* to do anything, you can't fail, and the market can't fail to understand what you do!

By contrast, most of us here would consider ourselves investors. We *do* care about utility, and we *do* care about real yields, and we *do* watch each upgrade with bated breath, and we *do* follow the discourse on roadmaps and adoption. We care about those pesky fundamentals, because we understand that having a fundamentals-driven thesis is the difference between investing and gambling, and we **are not here to gamble.** Ethereum, which by this point is deeply embedded in the crypto and web3 ecosystems, and which has, by most metrics, already won the adoption war - that's something we can sink our teeth into, and the fundamentals look *pristine*. Ethereum is bae for us because in buying it, we can feel secure that we are *investing* in something that has real underlying value beyond memes and narratives and the attention economy.

Consider the chasm between those two mentalities, and consider that we are in the *incredibly distinct* minority right now. We're rocking up to a casino with spreadsheets and reams of research. And we're shocked when the degenerates around us take one look at our stodgy "internet of value", our "global settlement layer", our "world computer", and pass it by, because *it has won a battle that memecoins are not even trying to fight.* 

Times are changing, of course. The gamblers that still make up the large majority of the market are soon going to be dwarfed by the massive capital that institutional investment can bring to bear, and make no mistake, those investors of size *do* do their homework, they *do* care about fundamentals. They know, like we do, that selling shovels during this gold rush is the best way to profit, and that Ethereum is that shovel, and moreover, that it will grow into the digital equivalent of Manhattan real estate in the fullness of time. How soon these more competent investors will arrive en masse is hard to say, of course - we've been crying out, "the institutions are coming, the institutions are coming" like some kind of latter-day Bilbo Baggins for years now. But I think most would agree that the ETF approvals, whenever they may come, will in many ways herald that advent. The time of fundamentals is not here yet, but it is coming.

So while we all sit here gnashing our teeth and pulling our hair while the markets happily ignore our precious Ethereum, keep in mind that while we're a tiny component of those markets today, what we really are is *forerunners*. 

We're not the last of our kind in a world devoid of reason, raging against the dying of the light.

We're the first.

<summary>u/reuptaken thinks something is missing in DeFi</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bx39o4/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2024/kyc6az2/)

I have this idea for quite some time now and I'd like to share it with you.

I think that DeFi lacks it's own high level script language. All major systems have SDKs (for advanced developers) and ‚Äì on the other hand ‚Äì UI, but nothing in between.

Take Uniswap as an example: you have low level SDK, where you have to deal directly with all the components (and bignumbers, various notations and so on) or pretty clumsy UI (try to move your position to a different range, even if it doesn't require swapping tokens ‚Äì it takes lot of clicking, waiting and it's almost guaranteed that price will move while you're doing all of this.

The solution would be high level language or set of scripts which would allow to execute all the most important functions of given Defi system by using simple commands. It should eg. understand token symbols, decimal numbers.

So instead of 100+ lines of code or using browser etc you could do:

\`movePosition 29133 2000 3000\` and after confirmation (which could be disabled) it's done for you.

or, in interactive mode, you could do

\`movePosition\` and you'd be asked to select from list or type which position, then set range.

Those commands could be executed as scripts. There could be also an event watcher (eg. watching price on some pool) to which you could bind scripts, executed when some conditions are met. Eg. when APY on AAVE is lower than on sDAI, withdraw USDC, convert to DAI using Curve and stake on Spark. Even if not automated it's much easier, faster to execute and probably cheaper.

What do you think about it?

**EDIT:** If there are some devs who'd like to do such project, please pm me.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bxw498/daily_general_discussion_april_7_2024/kyg795p/)

Yesterday, u/syzygy00778 posted a [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/s/9aD5v63vIo) to a comment discussing the identity of Satoshi. Buried in the comments is another link, to an [EXCELLENT article](https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10) titled "Len Sassaman and Satoshi: a Cypherpunk History".

I'll paste the first two paragraphs, and let you read the rest..

"We‚Äôve lost too many hackers to suicide. What if Satoshi was one of them?

Embedded on every single node of the Bitcoin network is an obituary. Hacked into the transaction data, it‚Äôs a memorial to Len Sassaman, a man essentially immortalized in the blockchain itself. A fitting tribute in more ways than one.

Len was a true Cypherpunk‚Äî equal parts brilliant, irreverent, and idealistic. He devoted his life to defending personal freedoms through cryptography, working as a developer on PGP encryption and open-source privacy technology, as well as an academic cryptographer researching P2P networks under blockchain inventor David Chaum."

<summary>u/nixorokish is looking for feedback from all solo/home stakers!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bypiin/daily_general_discussion_april_8_2024/kynxvls/)

Any node operators / solo stakers!

EthStaker & Obol are putting out a survey to get to know the landscape of home stakers and solo stakers. The goal is to create publicly available data that accurately represents what home/solo stakers care about, what kind of software and services we mostly use, what we need, etc. The info can be used to advocate for stakers in ongoing research based on their own words. Some questions were contributed by EF researchers themselves

It shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes, most questions are optional, and no data collected can be tied back personally to people (the survey software is FOSS!). We aim to repeat the survey every 6-12 months to get an idea of how the landscape is changing. It's available in English, Mandarin, Spanish & Italian. We'll leave it open for 2-3 weeks depending on volume

**The survey is primarily aimed at those running personal validators** (anywhere! Cloud services, bare metal services, at home, with a staking-as-a-service provider), **minipools, or DVT clusters**. If folks have any feedback or suggestions for the next iteration of the survey, would love to hear them! Feel free to direct them to me or to the EthStaker team email (team at ethstaker dot cc)

<summary>u/KuDeTa brings us an Aestus update and u/superphiz endorses it</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bzjwc2/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2024/kyumb50/)

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

The Aestus Relay team (that's me, and /u/austonst) have decided to run an experiment in the EigenLayer AVS Operator space. I want to test whether our service and reputation in the MEV-Boost ecosystem as a credibly neutral and solo-staker focussed infrastructure provider, might be of benefit in other domains. I honestly don't know how this is going to work out, but it's an interesting sideline to pursue.

So, as EigenDA hits mainnet today, i'm announcing our intent, and hoping that you might support this by delegating your Native or Liquid Restaking Tokens to us [here](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x30eafe8869a1528660a97b7a7e8e2d0037dcb922). Once we hit the required threshold of 320 ETH, we'll begin operations. I expect this to take a few days. 

I'll write out a longer post that sets out our motivations and intent, soon. But in brief: it seems clear that the restaking and AVS ecosystem is in danger of rapid domination by staking pools. We hope to make a small difference by leveraging our existing infrastructure in pursuit of decentralisation. 

The technology doesn't appear to support it yet, but once it's possible - we'll figure out how to make sure native solo re-stakers don't pay any fees to use our AVS services.

 I don't encourage anyone to participate in Eigenlayer restaking because of their stated intention to onboard all validators (that's a form of network capture), but if you DO use Eigenlayer and need to delegate your LSD tokens to a node operator, I'd really encourage you to choose Aestus.

Aestus is made up of two long time members of /r/ethfinance, /u/austonst and /u/KuDeTa. In all of my interactions with them I've found them to be working in the right directions.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains how big of a deal fully homomorphic encryption is</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bzjwc2/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2024/kyu8nn2/)

So on the EVM call last Friday [I went on a rant](https://www.youtube.com/live/xYQWGTENc5o?t=4624) for a few minutes after JT read my doot. It's so good I'm literally just cleaning it up and transcribing it here:

FHE is complementary to zk-proofs. Zk-proofs say that I did the calculation honestly. We can prove something like I calculated 4+5 honestly and you don't have to go and rerun it yourself to get the answer to that. FHE can be used for many things outside of AI but it's especially valuable for things like DePin.

For example Biometric Authorization. When you want to take your thumbprint or eyeprint and use that as an authorization mechanism. You don't want to give someone your decrypted eyeprint. Today, without FHE, we encrypt your data in transit so the people in the middle can't get it, then we decrypt it on the receiving side, and then the person on the receiving side now has your decrypted eyeprint and can basically just impersonate you. There is fundamentally trust with whomever is the processor of your data.

With FHE, we can give you an encrypted eyeprint, they can check that your eyeprint is actually you, without knowing it's you. They don't have something that can be reused. So they can do authorization without you leaking your public data.

The same thing would be true if I was in healthcare and wanted to make health predictions about you. If I know it's you and you give me all your health data what am I going to do? As a centralized provider I'm going to take that data, I'm going to jot it down, and then I'm going to sell it on the data market to some health insurance companies so they can jack up your rates.

As a user, I want the output of the LLM that tells me what might be wrong with me without the processor of the data being able to jot it down and sell it maliciously against me and add that extra monetization. The same thing would be true in a lot of places. It should be true throughout all of web2. This should explode and become mandatory in certain environments where privacy should be sacrosanct. But in DePin especially, because of permissionless compute, I can't even just say I trust Amazon. I have no idea who the processor of the data is and due to market forces it is going to devolve into the most malicious operator who is able to extract the most monetization out of the data they steal.

So for DePin to be applicable to any area where there is the remotest sense of secrecy or privacy we need to be able to do calculation on an untrusted operator and both prove that they did the calculation honestly (zk-proof) and that they didn't have access to the underlying data (FHE). So you put these two technologies together and you get something that can eat into the margins of centralized compute providers like AWS in a significant way.

To put their margins in perspective, a P5 instance on AWS right now is $92 an hour. I can buy that machine for about $350k. At $92 an hour that's over $800k a year, Amazon is making over 200% APR on the investment of the machine. There is an extraordinarily huge margin there and the effect of that is that the highest grade of compute we have isn't democratized and therefore the apps that require that grade of compute are increasingly being centralized into a few tech oligarchs.

Due to the compute requirements, this basically translates to AI. So we're seeing brick wall around AI being built every time we add another parameter to the LLM. Chat GPT was 1.5B parameters; it takes about 13 gigs of video ram to hold and use the model. Chat GPT 4 is bigger. We're going to go to a trillion parameters. We're going to get to a point where you need to have hundreds of gigs of video ram just to serve on the model and that's not going to be accessible to the average person. The average person isn't going to buy a half million dollar machine from NVidia. We need to be able to provide that high end compute to them at a lower margin than AWS is charging.

That is both an opportunity and a moral imperative of Defi and Depin. We need to make the compute required to access the technologies we are pioneering more democratically accessible before they become permanently locked behind brick wall and only accessible to a few tech oligarchs and used in their most extractive possible way against humanity.

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra discusses the pros and cons of an ETH issuance change</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c0dgy2/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2024/kyzga3i/)

Today's Bankless discussion came at the perfect time. I had just finished reading u/AElowsson 's [analysis](https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171) and I think I understand more clearly what's really at stake (heh) here. I have to admit my initial reaction when I read the proposal was pretty negative, so in order to help others make up their mind and also keep track of all the arguments that I see, I've made a list of the pros and cons as I've understood them, and explained them as simply as possible. If there are any more that you can think of and ELI5, I'll be happy to add them to the list.

**Pros of issuance change:**

- The network stability benefits from an optimal number of validators, as it's more difficult for a huge number of validators to effectively attest blocks fast enough.

- The ETH that remains in circulation is not superseded by LSTs, which apart from having smart contract, centralization and rugpull risks, make the LST a proxy for ETH. As a result, ETH does not lose its "moneyness" in the eyes of its users.

- Non-stakers benefit immensely from an issuance reduction. Currently, non-stakers benefit from the burn by having an effective ~0.5% APY, and at the same time, stakers get >3%. However, as more ETH is staked, non-stakers end up not benefiting at all as more and more rewards go to stakers, who at a minimum will be getting 2% at 100% ETH staked.

- The more ETH is staked, the harder it will be to implement this change. This is due to several reasons, most important of which is that big staking providers have a huge incentive to block it. Lido has already come out in favour of *ALL ETH* being staked and wanting as much of it to be stETH. What would happen in a post-staked ETH ETF world, when BlackRock lobbies against implementing a change to issuance?

**Unclear if issuance change will be a pro or a con:**

- It is not clear how this change will affect the dynamics between solo/hobby stakers and huge staking services. On one hand, there's definitely a limit where solo stakers would exit, and if the staking pools manage to profit though other means, the APY could be very negative and drive all solo stakers out. On the other hand, a market optimized APY leaves less space for staking pools to get a cut of the profits, and if solo stakers eventually have all the ways to profit through other means as big pools, they might be more resistant to low APY.  Personally, I would keep a validator up even at half a percent APY, but would not keep my validator up at, say, -5% APY.

-  Fewer ETH staked means less economic security for a network that aims to secure trillions of dollars of assets. However, those fewer ETH can end up having more economic value in the long term due to a more robust and valuable network, so the end result is not immediately clear.

**Cons of issuance change:**

- Changing the issuance *again* will lead to huge amounts of FUD, and ETH losing some of its "moneyness" due to the belief that the EF can unilaterally change the monetary supply.

- It's definitely not good optics at a time when the SEC is investigating and will be pretty bad for our hopes for an ETF.

- The issuance can and probably will need to be changed again. The main reason is that there are economics we simply do not understand, like the effect restaking will have on the amount of ETH staked. Also, the amount of validators might go down *significantly* with EIP-7251 (max-ETH per validator), leading the network to require more validators to be sufficiently decentralized. Finally, there are ideas for future updates that, if implemented, will significanly alter the economics of ETH. MEV-burn is one frequently discussed here, but the [Anti-correlation Penalties for validator attestations](https://ethresear.ch/t/analysis-on-correlated-attestation-penalties/19244), which in my understanding disincentivizes big staking providers by implementing heavier penalties when lots of validators lose an attestation at the same time, will most probably also affect the number of validators and the staking pool-solo staker dynamics.

---Personal opinion below---

So here is my view now: I am still mostly on the fence regarding the *immediate* (see:Pectra) issuance curve change, but at the same time **I want to come out in support of an eventual change of the issuance curve**  towards one where staking much more than 50% of the supply is heavily disincentivized by negative issuance.

The main reason for this is that most of the disadvantages of changing the issuance are short-term troubles, and won't have any effect on the long-term longevity of Ethereum. I'd rather see the project succeed and change the world, than make a bit more money for a year or five. "I'm in it for the tech" might be a meme, but it's also the best way to analyze long-term investments, and it would be much easier for me to leave a project that has ossified before being finished, than it would be to leave because the price dumped. Changing Ethereum's issuance will not only make it a more robust network, but also better money, especially for smaller holders that cannot stake. 

ETH needs to keep changing for the better, so don't sacrifice the future to the present. That's what Bitcoin did, and apart from the fact that it will have huge issues eventually, it ended up being only a shadow of what it could be.

<summary>u/benido2030 investigates the risk of restaking to the Ethereum network</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bpobg6/daily_general_discussion_march_28_2024/kwxed0y/)

So a couple of days I asked [if the EF wants to kill or at least tame restaking](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bn6io6/comment/kwgas0b/). I relistened to the UCC episode and here's my understanding. 

Restaking is not restaking. At least in the case of Eigenlayer (and I think for now its fair to assume Eigen will be 80%+ of the restaking market) technically any asset could be used as collateral. Just because right now it's validators via eigenpods or staked ETH via LSTs doesn't mean that's the endgame. Actually pure ETH, USD or even other tokens could be used to secure the AVS. This seems to play an important: 

If the AVS really requires the restaker to be a validator then the plan is to "smoothen" rewards, which likely (!) means that MEV spikes will be captured and burned/ redistributed. Even though they didn't mention this I guess something like based sequencing where the validator sequences the L2 could be one of these cases. The goal is to make sure big entities aren't in a better position to capture value than solo stakers. 

If the AVS is just secured by capital provided, but the security is not connected to a validator and could be done by someone with USD and a computer, then that's a different story. 

I still have many questions... 

- How does the protocol even know restaking happens? 
- Apparently rewards are streamed directly, how can it be captured? 
- What is captured/ how is "MEV" defined?

<summary>u/superphiz is brainstorming a beacon chain incident severity scale</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bqhysw/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2024/kx3y1k9/)

I'm a big fan of the work that /u/hanniabu and EthStaker (/u/nixorokish) have done with https://ethstaker.cc/incidents to document Beacon Chain incidents in a publicly aggregated way. I think this is awesome for transparency and accountability.

I was brainstorming ways that it might be improved, and I think it could be helpful to convert this page to a table and include a severity scale. Here's an idea what that might look like, and I think it would be awesome for other people to take that apart.

I'm never good with these scales, I wonder if the most severe incidents should have higher or lower incidents. This example is ranked with lower severity = ~~lower~~ higher number. I also think it's good to leave room for a 10 point scale and realize that there may be shuffling over time.

ALSO, I think it may be useful to indicate that different events can trigger the same level of severity, as I've tried to illustrate below. 

Note that this is a very first draft and it would need a ton of editing by others to be useful.

**Beacon chain incident severity scale:**

----

**Minor**

Severity 10 - Minority client issue that caused that client to miss attestations, participation above 95%, no missed slot.

Severity 9 - A client or multi-client issue causes participation to drop between 85% and 95%, no more than 1 consecutive missed slot.

Severity 8 - A client or multi-client issue that causes participation to drop between 66% and 85%, no more than 1 consecutive missed slot.

----

**Medium**

Severity 7 - A beacon chain consensus or execution client becomes a majority client (greater than 66% use)

Severity 6 - more than 1 consecutive missed slot; or any entity exceeds 33% of validators

Severity 5 - 

----

**Major**

Severity 4 - Any entity exceeds 50% of validators

Severity 3 - 

Severity 2 - No transactions were processed on the beacon chain for < 1 hour

----

**Extreme**

Severity 1 - No transactions were processed on the beacon chain for > 1 hour; An entity exceeds 66% of validators

<summary>u/KuDeTa explains why many block relays are closed source</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1braopv/daily_general_discussion_march_30_2024/kx9llpt/)

To monetise their infrastructure, relays need a performance edge - which they can't possibly maintain if everything is open source. So to some extent, competing at all necessitates competing in private. At the moment, ultrasound are running a fee delta / bid adjustment [experiment](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/docs/blob/main/bid_adjustment.md) in which they try to capture the difference between the highest and second highest bids - effectively depriving the validator of it. By doing so, they can take a fee - but also break some of the natural resilience of the mev-boost system - as bids are now unique to their relay. As i understand things, they also have a closed source rust implementation of the relay codebase, and have done some work with reth to try and improve bid simulation performance (vs geth). Those are the broad strokes, and you'll see that they do open source some of their core thinking.  


Frankly, it's very difficult to work out exactly who is running what code, and what is clear is that none of the relays (including Aestus - though all our code is opensource) are vanilla MEV-Boost anymore, except Flashbots. /u/benido asked me elsewhere if this can't also be seen as a "good" thing. Judge for yourselves based on the recent incidents. I would much rather find a way to incentivise relays (until we can get rid of them entirely) such that they want and need to work together. An upfront fee is probably more healthy. However, we should also face facts: the validator set is pretty mercenary and convincing Coinbase, LIDO and others to e.g. only use open source relays seems unlikely to happen.   


To make matters even more interesting, we seem to be entering the early stages of a race to compete on timing. Bloxroute proudly boast they are making validators who sign up to their gateway an additional 6.4% of MEV income. Where does that come from? The next proposing validator (not using their service). I haven't managed to get to the bottom of whether other relays (including US) are yet doing this, but i wouldn't be surprised if they are.   


I've spent time with people from across the MEV (relay/builder/searcher) ecosystem at various events, and i want to underline that while it's somewhat tempting and human to try and reduce this to a question of individual/entity behaviour or ethics, threatening everyone with the ethereum police really misses the point entirely. The incentives are broken and the competition increases fragility. Don't hate the player - hate the game.

[u/impliedpotential3497](https://reddit.com/u/impliedpotential3497):

There shouldn't be any significant issuance or monetary policy change unless the issue is something so obvious and objectively agreeable or existential already. The reasons for any significant changes to issuance now seem to be for highly subjective reasons. The threat to centralization comes much more from some central body trying to tweak monetary policy, not from the market, institutions, individual users, and the broader ecosystem naturally figuring itself out. Even if only a small percentage of ETH is in circulation in the future then so be it...¬†Anyone drumming up ideas for changes to monetary policy right now should rather maybe consider simplying user experience for solo stakers or try to educate the masses on holding or using ETH the hard asset. Even advocating to LST's and the like to follow some kind of better defined framework would be a better approach.¬†There are so many other ways to address subjective issues like the ones being brought up imo. Monetary policy changes are like the absolute last resort.

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

There are good arguments on both sides of the issuance debate. I don‚Äôt, however, believe _consistency_ of monetary policy is a good argument in favour of doing nothing. It‚Äôs naive to imagine we could have ever designed the yield curve correctly the first time around, given MEV, LSTs and restaking had yet to appear. It would therefore be hubris to suggest that any changes we make now will ever be considered final, given all the unknown unknowns. Crypto just moves too quickly. The capacity for evolution and adaptation is a core strength of the ethereum community and we should embrace it to stay ahead of the competition.

[u/asdafari12](https://reddit.com/u/asdafari12):

Some things I believe are true. I could be wrong on some. 

- The large validator size is growing quickly, in part thanks to Eigenlayer, and it is becoming a huge problem for the clients to handle. This is the main reason the EF wants to limit issuance.
- The current reward of 3% is not enough to encourage solo stakers, let alone half of that, which is what the new EF proposal would mean. 
- Solo staking is too difficult. Since I started early 2020, not much has changed (officially). It's still the same arcane terminal commands + you now "have" to run MEV boost too. Ethdocker seems awesome, I trust the guy that made it but would have liked to see something more "official" and ideally at staking release rather than two years later. I think it would have had better penetration. 
- More should have been done to incentivize solo stakers financially. More could have been done as well. We have seen airdrops to solo stakers and even incentivized smoothing pools. 
- The community is overall fine with how much ETH we pay to validators today and our issuance. We even have deflation. 
- I mostly trust the EF to know better but I don't want anything rushed, this shouldn't come in the next fork imo. Earliest is like a year, but then it looks to be too late in regards to slowing the validator growth rate, we need something now.

If solo staking equilibrium yield is lower than pooled staking equilibrium yield. Then we must overpay issuance to ensure solo stakers can exist, otherwise the network will become strongly centralized.

Another argument on top of this one, whatever the optimal issuance curve is (if there is even one), we must approach it from above. Because if we overtighten we will end up having to raise issuance. And this creates a very bad precedent that will likely erode any monetary credibility Ethereum may have.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains the potential of Fully Homomorphic Encryption</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1buk90w/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2024/kxvmtnr/)

A limitation of permissionless execution for as long as I've been around has been that everything is necessarily public. We use mixers on occasion to obfuscate fund movements but the underlying program and underlying data for smart contracts is always public. If there's a chain adjacent service like an Oracle, everything about its function is public. If I wanted to use a smart contract or a keeper to serve some data for me conditionally on authorization I end up having to use a centralized service at some point to issue a decryption key. Otherwise whomever wants the data could simply join as a data provider, download everything, and then exit without paying for the data. The root problem is just that if a system is permissionless then it can't be entrusted with secrets.

This has become an acute pain point for AI x crypto applications recently. We can't use DePin to train on private data or to serve answers from private models. However, there's some math magic just on the fringe of development at the moment that could blow this space open: zk-proofs + **fully homomorphic encryption** (FHE)[1](https://www.zama.ai/introduction-to-homomorphic-encryption).

Here's an ELI5: I want you to add two numbers for me but I don't want you to know which numbers I'm adding. Let's say I want the answer to 1+1. So I add a secret number known to me but not to you to each input, let's say 3 and 4, and I give you the problem 4+5. You calculate 9. To get the decrypted answer I just subtract the sum of the secret numbers in my input from your answer: 9-(3+4)=2. This looks silly in the reductive case but makes a lot more sense as the number operators (+, -, *, /) and operations in the calculation grows. Today, there are workable FHE encodings that can support any combination of multiplication and addition on an encrypted space. This is promising because as it turns out neural nets are nothing but a very large combination of simple arithmetic operations...

Hence a [FHE encoded neural net](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-021-01076-8) can potentially be run on [DePin](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/depin) infrastructure while protecting property rights to the underlying model. Once we see some of the initial projects like [zama](https://www.zama.ai/), [privasea](https://www.privasea.ai/), and [based.ai](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01008.pdf) prove out this concept and it becomes more widely understood the full applications of FHE in crypto are going to be **huge**. I highly suggest Rabbit Holing on this one for a few hours.

Hey guys. As a genesis solo validator, I would like to share with you the reasons why I oppose the increase in block size at the present time.

1. It is pointless. We are not going to attract new users or new use cases by simply reducing fees for a very limited time. No one is going to consider using Ethereum because a transaction costs $4 instead of $5. I understand it is annoying to hear the same complaints over high fees over and over again, but those complaints are not going to be tamed with a fee reduction that would anyway last very little. As an example, the last hard fork has indeed reduced fees on L1 more or less on the same scale that a block increase would do, but almost no one noticed.
2. It is not sufficiently tested and could be dangerous, especially for small validators. When reasons for increasing size are cited, reference is usually made to disk size, but other more important factors for small operations are bandwidth, data-rate limits, computational capacity or ram installed. Increasing the block size increases resources and could expose small validators to spam attacks that cause them to lose their turn and thus allow an attacker to steal rewards or MEV from them.
3. It could hurt L2 scaling plans. The last hard fork allowed Ethereum L2s to start competing with more centralized alternative L1s. However, even with 3 blobs per block the tps we are seeing are very low with respect to for example Solana, whose transactions per second are close to 1000. An increase in the number of blobs can be very significant to achieve equivalent capacity. This improvement, in contrast to a limited increase in block size, can indeed attract new users, developers and use cases, since the chosen L2 could offer the same tps as L1 alternatives, but with the added security provided by the Ethereum network, as well as compatibility with existing tools and ease of development. In short: the space we would lose by increasing the block size in a rush might be needed in the future to increase blob capacity.

Therefore, I think this is not the right time to increase the block size. I think we should wait until Ethereum L2s have reached a point where they can compete with alternative L1s in terms of capacity and the cases where complex blocks can cause small validators to miss blocks have been thoroughly tested and eliminated.

I recently read Polynya's latest blog, which reminded me of how grateful I am to be a part of this group. X is nothing but a shitshow; Farcaster looks promising, but the conversation is fragmented. The only place where the comment-to-quality ratio is high is here, with a wholesome bunch of strangers discussing the whole ecosystem and offering help without prejudice. It's a rare find in the current market, especially now that meme mania seems to be leading the charge.

Even beyond this group, some fellow members have offered their guidance and support. MinimalGravitas, my dude, if it weren't for your kind words, I would have left the DAO in '22. Do you know, a fellow member even offered me their NUC, its up and running. Every time I look at it, I forget the gloom I see elsewhere, it gives me hope. This motivation to run a node, even if it's non-staking, was inspired by Nixo's tweet. Not directly, but Logris has taught me valuable lessons through his well-explained comments. Whether on vacation or gone camping, no worries, Tricky got you covered with doots when you're back. Benido and Hanni have written extensively on different topics, from DAO to LST to client diversity. And the list goes on... all that without an expectation of any financial return.

Sometime we take things for granted or we are unaware of impact of our action but not today, today I want to show my gratitude and thank you all for contributing to this forum. Even if I have nothing to say, I ready the daily and learn something from it and I am greatful for that.

<summary>u/pa7x1 does some L2 education and FUD busting</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bksave/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2024/kw3ngor/)

L2beat.com does an amazing job at explaining the trade-offs in detail. L2s are definitely not web2 technology. In fact, it's so novel that they are still being built, that's why they have some amount of training wheels and safety guards at the moment.

The first thing to observe is that you can give up decentralization for an L2 as long as some protections are guaranteed to the user programmatically. It's OK for a rollup operator to run the rollup themselves, it may even be permissioned, it may even be censored. And that's OK as long as you can always escape hatch with your assets to the L1. And the analogy I would use here is that this is the exact same thing that happens with private businesses. A restaurant doesn't have to serve you, they may reserve the right to not have you as a customer sometimes for trivialities like dress-code. A web forum may ban you. And that's fine because you can go anywhere else. If you are unhappy with the rollup you get your stuff and go somewhere else. Your fundamental rights are preserved in the public space, the L1 is the public space. And the L1 is permissionless and censorship-resistant so you can be sure there will be somewhere else to go.

Here is an example of how this works in Arbitrum: <https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum#risk-analysis>

> Sequencer failure
> Self sequence
> 
> In the event of a sequencer failure, users can force transactions to be included in the project‚Äôs chain by sending them to L1. There is a 1d delay on this operation.
> Proposer failure
> Self propose
>

Even if Arbitrum went for the ultimate censorship, turning off their rollup, you would be able to use the L1 and escape hatch.

Bitcoin maxis have been parroting a never ending stream of FUD arguments for years, systematically being proven wrong and when that happens instead of recognizing their mistake they move to new FUD arguments. Facts be damned. I would recommend updating your bayesian priors taking their track-record into account.

<summary>u/OkDragonfruit1929 lists the few ways which may result in failure for Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bksave/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2024/kw43pjp/)

I am dealing with internalizing the hate toward Ethereum, but am also trying to prevent myself being blinded by my own bias.

One trap that people often fall into is refusing to acknowledge any scenario where their beliefs, convictions, or ideals could ever be "wrong".

As a result, I am compiling a list of things which would indicate to me that I was wrong about Ethereum. That Ethereum was a failed experiment doomed due to irreparable flaws. Of the 4 listed here, any one of the first 3 coming true I think would be enough for me to concede the "death of ETH".

1. Unresolvable security vulnerabilities causing finanacial losses, undermining trust in Ethereum's security model. This could include supermajority bugs causing a chain split, or repeated successful attacks against the network.
2. If Ethereum's development or governance becomes heavily centralized, contradicting its ethos of decentralization.
3. A breakdown in the Ethereum community, whether due to internal conflicts, disillusionment with the project's direction, or a mass migration to other projects, could severely impact the development and support of the platform.
4. To a lessor extent, I would also concede that regulatory actions against Ethereum specifically, or decentralized platforms in general, could be a huge blow to ethereum's vision as the settlement layer for the world's finance and uninteruptable web3. I say this would prove ethereum's "failure" in my mind to a lessor extent than the other scenarios I listed here, because even if the governments of the world put aside their differences to all agree to attack ethereum or restrict it, ethereum would never truly die. It would simply go underground. It would be vastly less profitable, but it would not disappear entirely.

For myself, and hopefully some of you here who are deeply invested in Ethereum's success, these scenarios would likely need to be demonstrable, systemic, and irreparable to convince us that Ethereum was a failed experiment.

What you think about Vitalik 5 year time-frame for Ethereum to prove its ready for mainstream real world adoption?

<https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-says-ethereum-must-achieve-mainstream-adoption-within-five-years>

Despite the cc subreddit pushing a negative narrative, it seems like Vitalik is actually bullish.

Also, improvements to be able to run a node (not sure if validators but probably) without the need for a lot of storage space. zk-SNARKs would help us move from our staking rigs to just a phone/very light processing on a computer.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bll5sr/daily_general_discussion_march_23_2024/kw9opzu/)

With EIP-7251/MaxEB coming I was curious why the beacon chain did not launch this way in the first place. It has an interesting backstory.

From the EIP itself:

> The limit on the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE is technical debt from the original sharding design, in which subcommittees (not the attesting committee but the committee calculated in is_aggregator) needed to be majority honest. As a result, keeping the weights of subcommittee members approximately equal reduced the risk of a single large validator containing too much influence. Under the current design, these subcommittees are only used for attestation aggregation, and thus only have a 1/N honesty assumption.

This will remove the 32e max limit for validators, **greatly reducing bandwidth consumption** for stakers. - eric.eth
https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1770836409848332554

Will maxeb really reduce bandwidth **greatly**? Only if the whales with thousands of validators actually consolidate to big validators instead of many small ones, something that is yet to be seen. You could argue that they don't want to have 3200 ETH validators as the impact of a bug would be 100x bigger. It would lower Ethereum protocol risk though so should be in their best interest. 

It seems unlikely to me that we will lower the number of validators by 50-75%, which is what I would consider greatly reducing consumption. More likely we will drop by some 10-30%, so not really making a big difference in terms of bandwidth.

[u/interweaver](https://reddit.com/u/interweaver):

This is almost certainly referring to attestation subnets.

For each validator a solo staker has (up to 64), they have to subscribe to a new attestation subnet, with all the gossip and increased traffic that causes.

If that solo staker consolidates their validators under maxEB, they could go back down to a single attestation subnet, reducing bandwidth usage significantly.

Just wanted to amplify u/_WebOfTrust post from 2 days ago... what an awesome community this is. I am a relatively late comer into the community. 

Thank you all for consistency sharing your knowledge with internet anons like me. I've learnt more from this sub than any other place on the internet. I literally got a job offer because I dove into MEV because of the daily doots posts about it consistently throughout the past few years (I didn't take the offer in the end). 

Your selfless sharing has consequences, and I my career trajectory is one of them. 

Other than that this year has been transformative for me career-wise (got back in the crypto industry after a stint in fintech) and personally as an artist (did my first solo exhibition yay!). Going to ETH Denver for the first time and meeting u/jtnichol and other folk was the most wholesome experience I've had in a long long time. 

I work on consumer side of crypto, specifically in games and 99% of the ppl are talking about the casino/degen aspect of crypto, I think they are firmly in the camp of "it's just how it is" , and perfectly captures what polyna's sentiment that 

"this evil in crypto is banal and normalized. This has become the identity of crypto - sure, some useful stuff, but mostly just infested with scams and absolute degeneracy."

Despite the mis-aligned incentives, greed, grift in the space, I don't see any other system that can even attempt to fix the problems we face at scale. I don't know what the answer is, but I believe it starts with places like ethfinance, that can influence the culture of the ecosystem.  

I also finally got my EVM today yay.

<summary>u/dataalways investigates client diversity</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bo0lmo/daily_general_discussion_march_26_2024/kwp0jmb/)

It's not a topic I look at much, or one that I plan to spend much more time on, but I spent my morning trying to fill in some knowledge gaps about execution layer clients this morning. Most of you guys rely on supermajority.info, but obviously there are some unknowns since not all proposer sets have publicly stated their client usage (Binance, Kraken, OKX, Bitcoin Suisse, etc.).

The idea is that even though most blocks are built through PBS, every proposer still has a small share of locally built blocks (min-bid reversions, network latency delaying payloads from relays, local blocks being more valuable than PBS if there isn't much MEV during the block, etc.) and for those subsets of blocks we can look at the extra\_data encoded on-chain to tag what clients proposers are using.

Part of the issue with this methodology is that besu and erigon don't actually embed extra\_data so the field is blank, and at the same time there are some MEV builders who try to stay anonymous and don't embed data, so we can only cleanly tag geth and Nethermind, and then we need to check vs off-chain MEV data to see if the empty data blocks are from anonymous MEV builders or from one of besu/erigon.

On top of that, there's occasionally been MEV builders using the Nethermind tag that briefly crop up. I think this is just from misconfigurations because they go away pretty quick, but it adds a bit of noise to the data. Basically the methodology is a bit of a mess.

As a quick summary:

* Binance is 100% geth.
* Kraken seems to use multiple execution clients but tagging what share is kind of hard. Could be 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 or maybe 1/2 geth, 1/4 nethermind, 1/4 besu or erigon.
* OKX is majority geth. They seem to use a bit of Nethermind (and maybe a little bit of besu/erigon), but the counts are really low. OKX is a pretty reliable proposer, so they don't have many local blocks.
* Bitcoin Suisse is 100% geth.

The data is here for anyone that wants a peak:

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bf7318/daily_general_discussion_march_15_2024/kuyoc9h/)

It might have gone under in yesterdays daily, but u/KnowNoShade  posted a very [interesting link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1beea63/daily_general_discussion_march_14_2024/kuydcgu/) about the new fee structure on Optimism and why they had such a huge reduction in cost after the Dencun hardfork. Blobs alone could not have reduced the fees by that much. What optimism did in addition was that Optimism started to consider priority fees in their fee calculation. The base fee can be close to 0 and optimism still makes enough money through the priority fee. Optimism does not directly subsidize transactions, but the way they calculate the transactions and set average gas usage for the base fee to increase it essentially means that the actors which pay a high priority fee are indirectly subsidizing the fees for the other users. And apparently there are enough users paying a high priority fee which makes OP chains still profitable. Quite interesting to be honest. According [Ryan Berckmans tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1768290443425366273) OP Mainnet and Base still make enough money through priority fees. I am not sure if this is also true for Zora as I would expect not too many people pay a priority fee there, I might be wrong there though. Overall, I think it is quite interesting how Dencun now has kicked off a rollup fee competition. Apparently arbitrum will also [improve their fees soon](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1767956874031444286).

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bf7318/daily_general_discussion_march_15_2024/kuznmae/)

Few more ARB DAO updates beyond [what I brought up a few days ago](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bcq1is/comment/kuiy35b/), more personal to what I've been up to if anyone is curious. (As well as open to feedback before I go 'live' with one of these items).

Late to the party, but ARB did release their 2023 Transparency Reporting (https://docs.arbit rum.foundation/foundation-documents#transparency-reports). If anyone wants to give it a read there is some good things too look at, although I will note page 11 might be my favorite :). And please note that 100% of the work was done by Questbook, I was just there becase I posted it to Tally / Snapshot. Just having a "LeonardoDeCapriopointsatthetv" moment.

I'll admit this sort of came up in January and then I got busy so it got pushed aside once Feb rolled around, but I'm probably going to start working towards it now that I have the time... I'm going to try to get some of ARB's council election processes standardized. More info here (https://forum.arbit rum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915). Basically, these different councils have elections and the process isn't very standard as different people are running the programs each time. I think that detracts from how effective these elections can be. My thought is that a minimum there is a lot of community support for "Shielded" voting (results hidden until completion). So I'm hoping at least that will get support, as I'm breaking it our into three categories:

  
\- Mandating certain election types be used to avoid common pitfalls with less effective voting methods.

\- Mandating "Shielded" voting, as there are too many ways to game the election if results are public as they go along.

\- Mandating some type of minimum period for applicants to apply for roles to ensure we can get the best possible field possible.

According to l2beat the L2s did yesterday 133 tps. A factor of x3 will place it around 400 tps. Solana seems to do around 500 tps. <https://realtps.net/>

With this rough numbers Ethereum seems to have beaten in scalability Solana. Can manage same order of magnitude tps but cheaper. But unlike Solana it has an actual roadmap to keep scaling:

- Blobspace can be increased trivially and it will be increased when demand is there.
- With some tweaks to calldata pricing we will likely increase gas space very soon because the current gas limit is very conservative. 
- Blobs have already reduced around 33% the state growth rate. And stateless Ethereum is in the works.
- Full danksharding provides a credible roadmap to scale tps by multiple orders of magnitude.

All that without having to give up on decentralization.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bgqm1m/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2024/kvbn81r/)

"Decentralization" is a complicated term. In crypto we usually see the system as decentralized based on criteria like "how many nodes have to collude to censor the system" or "how many nodes need to be taken out for the system to fail" or "how difficult it is for a single entity to take over governance". But there is a more traditional meaning for decentralization, a pre-digital one, which defines it not as a large system but many local ones and this is where blockchain has some shortcomings.

I am on this subreddit for the blockchain ideologies that resonate with me (and ma bags, of course). But I would also say that being "all in" is not great. Take Bitcoin maxis. The idea that all the complexity of expression and exchange of value should be scorched and replaced by a single system derived from a single limited resource (which at the onset has every uneven distribution) to me is nothing short of fascist. That idea is despotic and anti-human in the sense that it deprives us (you know, the people who are supposed to be benefitting) from the ability to decide how we want to express human relationships.

Now fans of smart contract chains (say Ethereum) are not Bitcoin maxis at all. Smart contracts are foundation for building any kind of system on top of it. In case of Ethereum experimentation and possibility of human expression (new forms of value, new forms of organization, new forms of interaction) are at the core of the ethos. Yet a blockchain network is still a single system, with one governance, with one limited-supply token, requiring electricity and internet, insecure and with potential middlemen. That said I think what is actually a corollary to Ethereum ethos is  cherishing of the good meat-space things - not everything needs to be onchain, digital has security limitations, organization comes in many forms, non-digital governance is important.

Appears to be wallet running an "address poisoning" scam:

Scammer -> new wallet -> victim

The scammer sends a small amount of eth dust to a newly created wallet, which sends it to the victim. The new wallet W* is created to have the same first and last four characters in the address as an address W the victim transacted with recently.

The idea is that the victim in a future transaction copies the target address from the transaction history and because of the address similarity takes the scammer-controlled wallet W* instead of the legit wallet W.

A quick HOP governance update. Although honestly it's a pretty light one as ultimately most votes over the last few months have been fairly standard DAO things. To run through a quick list ([https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth)):

* Vote "For" operational items - Community Multisig Refill (3), retroactive pay for moderators and renewal of the delegative incentivization trails
* Vote "For" AMM Incentives to new pairs that came to the HOP DAO to align with incentives provided to other pools
* Vote "For" exploring treasury diversification. It's been sort of a 'everyone agrees, but not much has gone forward' situation but I'm hoping as a broad concept for some diversification. As I don't think DAOs should be expected to have their treasury 100% allocated in their specific token. 
* And Voted "For" creating a new 'head of the DAO' role. The goal being to have someone who helps keep the DAO moving instead of relying specifically on the good will of delegates to take on projects. Such as running the bi-weekly calls, for example. I think this will help with some of the stagnation the DAO has seen of late. 

I'll also share that I've been heading HOP's application for the upcoming 12 week ARB grant program. Me and two other delegates that assisted with this just submitted our [finalized application located here](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech//t/hop-protocol-ltipp-application-final/21830). The goal is to subsize bridging fees to Arbitrum, as well as incentivize AMM pools, over those 12 weeks. Decision pending council / DAO vote, but I was really happy how it came out. So I have my fingers crossed.

Which, btw shout out to u/seamonkey82 as you'll notice a link to a certain ARB forum actually works now :)

<summary>u/Syentist has the latest on the gas limit increase movement</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bidash/daily_general_discussion_march_19_2024/kvlyn71/)

[Eric and Mariano starting an awareness campaign](https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1770136717401419859) to increase gas limit from 30 to 40mn. 

Gas limit can be increased in a coordinated and rational manner by validators. It doesn't need a hard fork. 

This is the exact amount that Vitalik suggested [during an AMA last year](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/s/wtvb9Sa9oD)

> How much gas limit can we safely increase now? and after Verkle?
> 
> Honestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even _today_ is reasonable. The gas limit has not been increased for [nearly three years](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit), which is the longest time ever in the protocol's history (that 2x bump in the chart in late 2021 is "fake", in that it reflects the EIP-1559 transition, which increased the "limit" by 2x but only increased actual average usage by [~9%](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p4nloh/why_has_the_chain_capacity_increased_by_9_after/)). And so splitting the post-2021 gains from Moore's law 50/50 between increased capacity and increased ease of syncing/verification would imply an increase to around 40M or so.

Long overdue and Godspeed!

If this drop bothers you, I potentially have bad news for you. Well, not really, but if we are really just at the start of a bull run, similar drops at higher USD values might make you sick... So prepare mentally for crazy stuff that will happen. Some random numbers to showcase the things we might be witnessing:

Disclaimer: Everything that follows is based on the assumption that your whole portfolio is in ETH and that we basically went from 4k to 3k (which, at least until now, we didn't, but we also peaked slightly over 4k, so 25% is as good as it gets). You're probably a little diversified, so your port value fluctuates a little differnet. Just pretend it is 100% ETH! 

If you have: 

* 25 ETH = 100k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 25k in a week
* 50 ETH = 200k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 50k in a week
* 100 ETH = 400k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 100k in a week
* 250 ETH = 1M USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 250k in a week

Good news: 1 ETH = 1 ETH, but from my experience from the last cycle it's the USD value that hurts. 

Bad news: If this is just the start of a bull we might 2.5x from 4k to 10k or even 4x to something like 15-16k. This is great, but a 25% drop will hurt even more. With ETH = 10k USD

* 25 ETH = 250k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 62.5k in a week
* 50 ETH = 500k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 125k in a week
* 100 ETH = 1M USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 250k in a week
* 250 ETH = 2.5M USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 625k in a week

or with ETH hitting 16kish

* 25 ETH = 400k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by **100k** in a week
* 50 ETH = 800k USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 200k in a week
* 100 ETH = 1.5M USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by 375k in a week
* 250 ETH = 4M USD a 25% drop like this cut your USD portfolio by **1M** in a week

Now why am I posting this? I know I can't really prepare you for these scenarios. You probably will have to go through these to really understand what this means. Also let me tell you I have **no** idea how I will feel *if* we hit 10k or 16k and drop 25%. May 2021 (basically down only from 4k to 2k within 2 weeks and even below 2k within 2 months) killed a lot of emotions and changed me long term I think. But if you just joined in the last 2 years, you should try to play through some scenarios and get used to losing a lot (USD) value in a short amount of time. 

And while I am at it... Think about how you would feel if we hit 15k and then the bear hits and we go down 75% :)

<summary>u/El-Coco-No shares his knowledge about finalization</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b2t640/daily_general_discussion_february_29_2024/ksow2ll/)

Finalization

I‚Äôve just been learning more about finalization and had a few ah-ha moments that made me very happy. I figured I‚Äôd share them here and also ask anyone to check my thinking. 

Finalization is not some magic 2/3 number, where an *almost* finalized block just needs to get over that hump of 2/3 of the validators attesting to it and then it‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs just a line that we‚Äôve chosen to define and say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a good bar to meet and we can say the block is ‚Äúfinalized.‚Äù 

So what is it and why does it matter?

The beacon chain chooses one validator at random to propose a block in each 12-second slot of the blockchain. That validator is the only one who can propose a block, and they can only propose one block. If they propose more than one block for the same slot, they get slashed and force-exited as a validator.

The interesting thing to note here is that an Ethereum block reorg only has two possible outcomes: the proposed block or an empty block. That differs from Bitcoin, in which reorged blocks contain different transactions and were proposed by different miners. 

Anyway‚Ä¶blocks are only validated by a fraction of the existing validators, as each validator only attests to 1 out of every 32 blocks. This is a way to keep Ethereum nimble, as requiring each validator to attest to each block would bog down the network. 

However, at the end of every 32 block section (32 blocks is an ‚Äúepoch‚Äù), there is a block called a ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù When a validator casts their 1-out-of-every-32 blocks vote, they also cast a vote attesting to the last checkpoint. When a checkpoint garners attestations from 2/3 of all validators in existence, that checkpoint (and every block before it) is considered ‚Äújustified.‚Äù 

And when two checkpoints in a row are justified (which naturally takes at minimum of two epochs or 12.8 minutes), the oldest of the two justified blocks is considered ‚Äúfinalized‚Äù along with every block that preceded it. 

So why is this important? Because of the double vote slashing offense. 

Each validator can only vote one way per block. They can‚Äôt change their vote, or a double vote slashing occurs. When a validator is slashed, they lose around .5 eth and are forced-exited after a certain amount of delayed time. This time delay allows the protocol to see who else is being penalized around the same time period. If there are many slashing offenses, the protocol assumes they were colluding to attack the network, and the slashing offenses start to get angry and impose an additional penalty. It‚Äôs important  to understand the formula for this additional penalty. It‚Äôs:

validator_balance * 3 * fraction_of_validators_slashed

In other words, if you‚Äôre the only offender, your additional penalty is negligible. However, if at least 1/3 of the other validators were also slashed around the same time, you lose *all of your stake*. (This is one reason that it‚Äôs so stupid to be running a super majority client, but I digress).

So let‚Äôs look at this in terms of a justified block. Most conservative case: 

A block is justified because exactly 2/3 validators have attested to it (and the other 1/3 haven‚Äôt voted yet). In order to get reorged, 2/3 + 1 validators need to attest to a different block in that slot. We‚Äôll, 1/3 of validators are still free to vote, but to get the other 1/3 + 1 validators, 1/3 + 1 of all total validators will need to cast a second vote. They can do this, but they‚Äôll get slashed. And a quick look at our handy formula above tells you this will result in a total slashing event of all of these validators‚Äô shit. 

And if it‚Äôs this costly to change a justified block, imagine how difficult it would be to reorg a finalized one. The details get a little tricky here for me, but I believe it would require over 2/3 of all validators losing all of their stake. Right now, that‚Äôs $73 billion dollars worth of security. Not only would the benefit of coordinating this attack have to be worth more than $73 billion, but the attacker would also have to corrupt over 2/3 of the decentralized validators of Ethereum. That last statement is the reason that decentralization matters in Ethereum, and why home stakers are soooooo important. Ethereum needs to be able to withstand a full on moloch attack worth all the money that will ever be settled on top of the chain. Since we like to think that‚Äôs the entire world‚Äôs economy, the value of the eth securing the network by validators will only take us so far. Decentralization does the rest.

<summary>u/accidental_green shares their validator updater for the upcoming hard fork and the circles back shares their story of writing a useful staking script</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b4h3wq/daily_general_discussion_march_2_2024/kt01amw/)

To help validators with the upcoming hard fork, I improved my open source [Validator Updater](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater) so everyone can easily update their validator in under a minute!

Detailed instructions can be found on the [Ethstaker post](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1b4o4ja/automated_validator_update_tool/), quick summary below.

**Note:** The updater is adapted from Somer Esat's guides, and saves the updated binaries to /usr/local/bin. If you have a different setup, you can move the binaries to your desired location after download.

**Validator Updater Summary:**

1. Select Execution Client: (Besu, Geth, Nethermind)
2. Select Consensus Client: (Lighthouse, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku)
3. Update MEV-boost? (Yes/No)
4. Click "Update"

That's it, updates process in the terminal and you can be back online before missing a single attestation!

Feel free to check out my other open source Ethereum projects:

[Validator Install](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install) - Install a full validator from fresh Ubuntu in minutes  
[Client Switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher) - Instantly switch execution clients to improve client diversity

All code is open source but has not been audited, so any testing/feedback is always appreciated.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b63kgo/daily_general_discussion_march_4_2024/ktaw87p/)

A Prysm dev forked my code!

I wanted to share my story in case anyone here is considering contributing to Ethereum and isn't sure how to get started.

So to start, I'm not a programmer. I was the "Excel guy" at the office because I knew how to do vlookups. I started dabbling in VBA and eventually wrote a macro to take an Ethereum address and lookup the balance using Etherscan API.

One day while updating my validator, I decided to try a Python script rather than copy/paste the 10 commands. I ran the script and was shocked it actually worked. I slowly added more clients and eventually created the [validator-updater](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater).

I figured if I could write a script to update, maybe I could write a script that took commands from Somer Esat's guides and create a full [validator-install](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install) script.

It took a few months, but I finally got it working. I decided to create a Github account and share on Ethstaker. People responded positively, but no one actually wanted to run it (would you trust your 32 ETH to a random script on Github?)

It was pretty disappointing to know I created something that made staking 100x easier, but no one wanted to run it. I made updates, added clients, but in the end it felt like I was screaming into the void (props to u/superphiz for saying he liked my project and encouraging me to continue working on it).

Eventually [u/nixorokish](https://reddit.com/u/nixorokish) at Ethstaker reached out and said they liked my initiative and wanted to send some DAI as a thank you. Once that DAI hit my wallet I remember thinking I made it, I'm officially on the Ethereum payroll!

A few months later, I got a notification that someone created a pull request on my repository. I went to investigate and noticed it was Preston Van Loon (Prysm dev) [fixing a typo](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install/pull/4) in my validator install code. Pushing the merge button made me feel like an actual developer.

He also forked my repository, which means it's now hosted on his[ Github](https://github.com/prestonvanloon/validator-install). That was a major boost to my confidence and Github street cred.

u/hanniabu reached out and suggested adding a keystore import to the installer. I worked up a few changes and he graciously reviewed the code and provided valuable feedback.

As the client diversity stuff became popular, I created [client-switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher) to help people switch execution clients with a single click. It was well received and multiple people reached out saying they were able to successfully switch to a minority client.

Recently u/coincashew forked my code and created their own one line installer, mentioning that because of my code they were able to write the whole thing in a single day. People were actually building off my code, and the idea of open source started to make more sense. 

So what's the point in writing all this? I'm not really sure. I spent years as a silent observer of this sub, so decided it's finally time to share my story and maybe inspire someone to start that project they've been thinking about.

This hasn't been very lucrative financially, but it's nice knowing I've contributed to Ethereum and made staking a bit more accessible. Not sure where it goes from here, but I'm cleaning up the code in hopes to eventually have it audited.

Thanks to everyone who provided guidance and encouragement. This really is a special corner of the internet, and I'm happy to be a part of it!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b4h3wq/daily_general_discussion_march_2_2024/kt14h6q/)

Be careful, someone is address poisoning transactions pretty efficiently.  I sent some ETH from wallet A to a new wallet B, and after the transaction went through, someone sent me a dust amount of ETH to wallet A.  The scammer's address has the same first 4 and last 4 characters as wallet B.  Now I have to be really careful not to accidentally send anything to the scammer's address.

Its alarming because of how quickly they did it, being able to brute force a vanity address with 8 matching characters, fund it, have the txs go through within a minute.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b59xrs/daily_general_discussion_march_3_2024/kt6ztfw/)

Hi guys, I am currently building a little website, mostly to improve my typescript and next.js skills. I am a backend dev trying to get more into frontends for a while, partly because of my job.

 I wanted to come up with an educational page about ethereum gas and L2s. The main points I want to bring across are how gas cost is not the same for every transaction, but depends on the type of transaction and especially the gas limit. Also I wanted to cover L2s and have an interactive option to compare the gas prices between L1 <> L2 (so far only mainnet and arbitrum)

  
There is a lot of confusion among newcomers about these topics, and maybe a website like this will help someone. I know there are similar pages, but as I said I mostly needed an excuse to build something haha.

Check out my prototype here [gashighdontcry.net](http://gashighdontcry.net)

Mobile view works but is not optimized yet.

While working on it I noticed that the arbiscan api always returns 0.1GWei for the gas price, so that part is kinda static, but afaik there is no better way to estimate arbitrum gas.

When you have ideas for more content, or notice bugs or whatever let me know!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr44ill/)

How do you do fellow digital asset securities investors? I would like to enquire about which registered broker-dealer you use to trade your digital asset securities such as Ethereum and others. I just don't trust these "crypto exchanges" like Coinbase, nor do I trust open source code as you never know when it might fail! Could one of you please recommend me an SEC compliant platform which I can trust to be properly regulated? I only feel comfortable holding crypto under such regulations as anything else makes me worry about a 2007-style collapse.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1asuvrp/daily_general_discussion_february_17_2024/kqtscvy/)

This week I turn the page on being a 1000 days on chain. I like to share this with you, as I have a lot to thank this community for. 

Getting from CEX to on chain is daunting and feels like stepping into the dark with dangers left and right. 

By lurking on Ethfinance I learned some best practises for basic security and common on chain sense. This made me confident in exploring the early L2's and dApps and qualifiing for, among others, ARB and OP. I got gifted an EVM lion and went on to stake on Gnosis and test for Diva. I rode the 2021 bull hype, and survived the 2022/2023 bear depths and despair.

From time to time I try to contribute here and help others out. 

Thank you Ethfinanciers for having me! May you live long and prosper.

Now onwards to the next 1000 days!

GM Everyone!  EY Blockchain Summit is back (again).  You can't keep us down :)

Registration is here and we'll do our usual collaboration with EthFinance on Q&A.

This year we're VERY FOCUSED on finance because of the global regulatory convergence going on.  We'll be doing the summit from London with a big focus on Europe's increasing regulatory maturity.

Speakers include the Lord Mayor of London and we've got folks from Fnality, Coinbase and more.  We'll also be showing our newest state-of-the-art privacy tech as well.

<summary>u/benido2030 updates the community driven ETH bull case</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr4fcer/)

Some months ago I started to ask for input for a community driven ETH bull case. Today I would like to update it, cause I think the bull market and developments of the past 5 months have changed some of the points we collected back then! 

**Ethereum the network**

* No competition for decentralized programmable blockspace: No alt-L1 is even trying to attack Ethereum by being more decentralized, all L1s are emphasizing speed/ throughput.
* Only credible neutral blockchain/ network: Ethereum's credible neutrality makes Ethereum the only truly trustless ecosystem.
* Ethereum is green since Proof of Stake: Ethereum's energy consumption is down by 99% which is a huge advantage with limited supply and the criticism e.g. Bitcoin faces.
* Ethereum still number 1 for developers: Ethereum is home to developers and hence innovation. New narratives like restaking are still developed by/ for Ethereum.
* The EVM is lindy: By now the Ethereum Virtual Machine is lindy
* Ethereum is the only blockchain/ with multiple clients: Ethereum is the only blockchain which is secured by multiple clients to guarantee liveness.
* Ethereum is finally scaling via Layer 2s: Layer 2s provide sufficient blockspace and result in lower fees for the ecosystem.
* EIP 4844 and protodanksharding: With the Dencun fork and the introduction of blobspace fees will be cut for Layers2 by an order of magnitude allowing for very low transactions cost.
* ETH continues to attract big companies: Companies like PayPal and Visa are developing payment solutions and even nation states are launching CBDC pilots based on the EVM

**Ether the asset**

* ETH as a triple point asset: ETH is covering all major asset classes:
   * ETH is a capital asset: Staked ETH allows you to collect a share of Ethereum's fees and produces cash flow.
   * ETH as Store of Value and Money: ETH is a great collateral and money e.g. in the NFT market.
   * ETH is needed for transactions: Since ETH is used to pay for gas fees, it is a consumable - and from previous cycles we know that people are willing to pay a lot for ETH's blockspace.
* ETH leaves CEXes and price discovery still happens on CEXes. Leaving ETH means that sell pressure goes down.
* Demand more ETH keeps going up, projects like Eigenlayer (but also Blast etc.) are like a black hole that takes ETH out of the liquid supply and locks it in smart contracts. LRTs can't make up for that.
* Restaking exports ETHs security and makes it a central asset beyond the Ethereum network and ecosystem
* ETH as a deflationary asset: Since the merge about 0.25% of the circulating ETH supply has been burned and ETH is deflationary. During a bull run the amount of ETH burned is likely even higher, leading to a supply shock and a ETH prices skyrocketing.
* ETH has yield: Since withdrawals were introduced, staking is as close to risk free as it gets and so is the yield. This narrative is unique, both in crypto, but also in traditional finance and will lead to increased demand from all kinds of institutions.
* The ETH ETF is coming. The BTC ETF seems to have surprised to the upside, net flows are way higher than people expected. The ETH ETF could come as soon as May and will be the only other ETF for this cycle.

I have deleted one bullet (that talks about nation state demand) and have exchanged it basically with the ETF , cause at this point this seems like a plausible narrative and all institutions could buy ETH that way. On top I have added new demand drivers like Eigenlayer and the effects it already had and will have.

I am sure there is more, so keep it coming if you think there should be more added!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr61w60/)

After creating my farcaster account, I realized there wasn't a way to easily share your handle in a frontend-agnostic way so i created [https://mycaster.xyz](https://mycaster.xyz).

With Mycaster you can easily create a share link which will redirect to whichever frontend the person opening the link uses.

**How does it work?**

The person that wants to share their account enters their farcaster handle and selects Generate Link. This will automatically copy the link to clipboard so you can share it.

For the people that click your link, they can select their preferred frontend to be redirected to. Their selection will be remembered and automatically forward them the next time they use a MyCaster share link.

Try it out! [https://mycaster.xyz/?p=hanniabu](https://mycaster.xyz/?p=hanniabu)

<summary>u/benido2030 introduces EthFinance's 3 $STRK delegates</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr41wnr/)

The day has (almost) finally arrived, Starknet has announced the $STRK token will be launched and airdropped tomorrow. If you are part of the airdrop: Congratz!¬†

Now some of you will probably dump it and that's okay. But for those that will keep it, you probably know that you will have to make a decision soon, because $STRK is a governance token and so you will have to pick a delegate. In the past couple of weeks and months we have found three delegates that would like to represent the community within the starknet ecosystem:

- u/atleft: You can find their [starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/515ad8e2-8b42-440c-b0ea-0f09a46557a6)
- u/_weboftrust: You can find their¬†[starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/50b1e132-b38c-4c44-8c40-021f950e276b)
- u/panthoreon: You can find their¬†[starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/13178099-69db-4c6c-87d7-5d2861ee6615)

While atleft and \_weboftrust are delegates already (governance was kicked off even before the token was airdropped, they both got $STRK delegated by the starknet foundation), panthoreon is a new delegate. You can find a little more info about that [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1971kkf/comment/khy6tvo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Panthoreon shared some thoughts, insights and motivation [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1amhanj/comment/kpmn520/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).¬†

So when you claim and delegate, keep these three names / delegates in mind. The goal is that all three delegates are open to listening to your feedback and vote based on comments and discussions happening on reddit. So instead of delegating to some maybe famous name from CT, that will probably not take your opinion and arguments into account, I think it would be beautiful if some of us delegated to "our delegates".¬†

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1avafsm/daily_general_discussion_february_20_2024/kr9vuft/)

Starknet is one of the very few non-EVM layer2s. The other very famous ones (OP, ARB, zksync, etc.) are (zk)EVMs. So it is unique in that sense, users need a different wallet and hence the UX is different than what we "usually" see. This is also true for developers, since they need to develop in Cairo, the programming language for Starknet. Because of that (almost?) all apps you can use on starknet are starknet-only since it's not easy to bring e.g. Uniswap or AAVE to Starknet. 

I believe there are only smart contract wallets. Account abstraction is natively built into Starknet. Also STRK can be used to pay gas in the future.

Anyway dude is LEGIT and recently announced they‚Äôre moving to ON CHAIN GOVERNANCE! You can‚Äôt get more decentralized than that. Pure democracy. Tokens = votes just like in the REAL WORLD. Eth and dare I say Btc need to get their shit together. Btc is a horse and buggy (with shitty suspension). Eth is a stock car (leaking oil). Solana is a space ship (leaky o ring - we know how that ends). Algorand is‚Ä¶sorry lost my train of thought. Cardano tho. They‚Äôve FIGURED IT OUT!

You‚Äôre on alert eth devs. The time of autocratic rule will soon be over. On chain governance - pure clean democracy as it should be - is our future.

[Argent yesterday announced on twitter](https://twitter.com/argenthq/status/1755256369471688793?s=46&t=YfmV111XTneWp8pMn5zaLA) (you'll not see me using that new "brand") that

>The Starknet airdrop is coming soon ü™Ç

I think Argent and Starknet are in a rather strong partnership. Argent is now a Starknet only wallet (Ethereum etc technically still works, but I think all other chains are "legacy" by now). If they post stuff like that, it's really close. 

We have two members from the community already that would like to be "our" delegate:

- [u/atleft](https://reddit.com/u/atleft)
- [u/_weboftrust](https://reddit.com/u/_weboftrust)

They both have been delegates for some time, since Starknet governance is already up and running. This is great, they know how it all works, they are known (both here and within the starknet ecosystem), so these are great people to delegate to. 

But I would still like to find a 3rd, "fresh" delegate, someone who has not been a delegate but is familiar with Starknet, wants to go into governance and has the time and energy to listen to this community. 

This time I would like to change the process a little. If there are people that want to be a delegate there, feel free to leave a comment. But since last time there was only tricky (and they sadly had to drop out again because of missing free time for such an adventure) I think we could also propose people we feel would make a great delegate. Those members of course have to decide if they want to do it (and potentially starknet is not the best protocol if they are not users/ familiar) but at least we can get a discussion started :)

[u/panthoreon](https://reddit.com/u/panthoreon):

So in response to this [post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/s/gk0zwZfFFG) from yesterday and the thread on farcaster:
I would like to get more involved with the ethereum community, so I would be honored if elected as a delegate for starknet.

- Who am I? -

I am a non-dev person with a mechanical engineering background, working in the supply chain field with a wide variety of functional experiences like network planning, procurement, demand planning, and logistics. My background equipped me with strong logic-based thinking, process mapping, and root cause analysis / problem solving skills.

As a person, I come from a very humble background that I believe has granted me a more holistic worldview; born and raised in Turkey, where corruption and poor fiscal management are like bread & butter (hence we see a wider adoption of crypto there):

I am very familiar with oppression, I know how it feels to be completely insecure in the midst of a military coup. I know what being tear gassed just for walking on the wrong street feels like. I know first-hand that to a third worlder, blockchain technologies mean a whole lot more in financial sovereignty.

Yet, I have also gained perspective of the Western world as i have been living in US for the past 10+ years, developing my expertise in Supply chain. 

A bit on the lighter side; I am a fitness enthusiast and have been a division 1 athlete in the past, I have self-taught art to a pretty serious level (primarily drawing) from imitating Spiderman comic books as a kid, and a huge animal-lover that spends a lot of his time with his two dogs. 

- Why am I interested? -

I have known about ethereum since the single digit price times but was at the time not interested in "crypto", seeing only gambling as its usecase back then.

I got more interested as the ecosystem developed and we started seeing real applications of DeFi, when I joined this community and have been a relatively silent reader that contributes every once in a while ever since. I am part of EVMavericks and active in a few other groups on Discord where you can find me under another handle: Aybala.

My real "Aha" moment happened when - thanks to this awesome community - I attended an EY blockchain conference in NYC, and learned about Baseline and the potential applications of zero-knowledge within my industry, supply chain. Ever since, I have been more invested, both financially and timewise, in the overall blockchain ecosystem.

As a non-dev and a non-social media person,  there are fewer possibilities to contribute to the ecosystem but being a delegate is something I can do.

I can commit to you all that I would invest the necessary time to ensure the best interests of this group, that I can bring to the table a perspective that is able to empathize and consider a wider ranges of human experience and be meticulous and process-driven in approaching any proposals / initiatives.

I appreciate everyone's time reading this and the consideration. Let me know if there is anything I can answer for you.

<summary>u/HombreDeCamote shares a long journey with a happy ending</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1amhanj/daily_general_discussion_february_9_2024/kpms478/)

A year ago I lost access to a significant to me amount of ETH. Since then I had been working with developers from Offchain Labs and The Arbitrum Foundation to retrieve the funds. Two weeks ago, following an incredible amount of effort from some big-brained devs, developers from The Arbitrum Foundation deployed retrieval contracts. Unfortunately the contracts were front run which resulted in the ETH being sacrificed and converted to a large block proposer fee. This would be similar to if I dropped a dollar on your front yard and asked you to pass it to me but when you reached out to do so, someone ran between us and grabbed the dollar.

I followed the transactions using a block explorer and noted that white hat hacker c0ffeebabe.eth had also attempted to rescue my funds but was also unable. I learned that c0ffeebabe.eth has used their skills to protect everyday users, in once instance they rescued $5.7M/2879 ETH from hackers and returned every cent/gwei, so I reached out for help. They, and users from this sub, were able to help me confirm that the proposal fee address belonging to Staked, which was recently acquired by Kraken Digital Asset Exchange. 

I was able to get in touch with several decision makers at both organizations. I explained the situation and provided documentation to prove the ETH had belonged to me till I lost access. Within a few short days they told me they had decided to return my ETH to me. As far as I know this is the first time a validator has returned a block proposal fee in an instance of theft or exploit , but please correct me if I am wrong. Regardless, I hope that the actions of Staked, Kraken, the Arbitrum Foundation, and OffChain Labs helps to set industry precedent moving forward.

I am incredibly grateful and incredibly lucky for the way this turned out. Without the support, sympathy, and skill of many strangers this outcome would not have been possible. Thank you to all those involved and to members of this community who helped me see this through.

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra reminds us to keep pushing for execution client change as we are currently in the danger zone</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1an9h36/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2024/kprog1y/)

So, I've had an idea about client diversity (and how to push more people to switch clients).

See, we are right now in a "tragedy of the commons" situation, where people CBA to switch from Geth because its usage is falling anyways, so someone else will do it, right?

Plus, psychologically, a 72% Geth dominance looks *way* better than a 85% Geth dominance. And on top of that, the risk *seems* lower to just stay on Geth.

But we all know that there's no difference whether the supermajority client is at 66% or at 90%. A bad block will finalize immeiately, and stakers will lose their stake. Most people on Ethfinance are aware of that.

The risk is the same... right? Well, no.

So, here's my idea. I think that, if you believe in the dynamics of "Layer 0", **a 66% supermajority is much, *much* worse than a 90% supermajority for stakers running the supermajority client.**

At 90% supermajority, I can easily see the community deciding on either a rollback (yeah, yeah, I know, never again, code is law etc., but let's be realistic) or accepting the Geth block as the correct one and going forward from there, either with some kind of compensation for Nethermind/Besu clients, or even no compensation.

At 90% supermajority, there would be little discussion and it's clear to me what would happen. And it's clearer the higher the Geth dominance is.

However, I think that at 66% things would be way more messier and contentious. This is now the "danger zone" where enough of the community did the right thing and have a strong enough voice, that the outcome of a supermajority client bug will be respected. *This* is where Geth users find themselves losing their stake.

And they might have a much more quiet voice than they expect. Centralized staking services, which are the ones that are mostly refusing to do the right thing (I'm looking at you, Coinbase and Binance) will just lose someone else's money, not their own. They got their cut on your profits, they lost your stake, c'est la vie. There might be some lawsuits, they are used to that.

**Change your clients. We are far from dealing with this and the situation is still critical.**

*Sidenote: I'm very much a layman (albeit a staking one), so I'd like some input if my thinking is wrong.

---

Something to note with the values on [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/) is the lower the geth dominance does, the less accurate it is

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1an9h36/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2024/kps9zqy/)

As of today, [Eigenlayer reports](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/) 2,470,100 Ether staked. With a total of 30,338,443 Ether staked (according to [Hildobby](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking)), this represents about 8% of the total staked Eth under withdraw contract addresses developed by Eigenlayer. This is far from the 22% threshold I advocate, but it's wise to look ahead.

On one hand, I don't see this as a problem at all. Eigenlayer is cool, and restaking is interesting. I've made a small deposit into Eigenlayer and I look forward to seeing what it does.

On the other hand, amassing 8% of the validator withdrawal addresses prior to launch might send some red flags, especially considering that Eigenlayer has indicated that they have [no intention of self limiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkDAODUTmaQ) (It's somewhere in that chat, I don't have a time stamp, feel free to offer it). 

Why is this concerning? It represents unnecessary protocol risk. Our ultimate mission as stakers is to secure the beacon chain. It's great if we can eek out extra revenue doing other tasks, but the social contract is to secure the beacon chain. We ought to recognize the real smart contract and governance risks here and recognize that any time we shift the balance and aggregate risk in one large pool we're posing a threat to the underlying protocol.

As usual, I'm not directing this to you, dear friend, I'm talking about the larger ecosystem risk. I imagine you're participating in Eigenlayer with less than 300,000 staked Ether and you likely represent less than 1% of the Ether staked on the beacon chain. I'm telling you that large entities who have no commitment to the success of Ethereum may put our network at risk and you ought to be aware of that AND ready to protect the protocol as well as your investment. You don't have to stand idly by as your work is eroded by anyone. 

I'm not asking you to avoid Eigenlayer or any of the cool ancillary platforms that have sprung up around it, I'm asking you to zoom out and recognize the dangers of aggregating risk. This isn't about Eigenlayer - it's about ANY risk aggregator who is ever willing to add existential risk to our chain. And I'll repeat myself: I LIKE the Eigenlayer concept.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll wants to put pressure on certain teams to implement better anti-scam systems</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ao10pn/daily_general_discussion_february_11_2024/kpwckfr/)

So, regarding u/HiPattern's [post yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1an9h36/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2024/kpthiuy/) about wallet dusting attacks which impersonate the most recent wallet you sent funds to in an effort to make it look like the top wallet in your Etherscan history is yours but it's actually just a similar wallet which is not yours in an effort to get you to accidentally send funds to their wallet next time you need to send to your previous sender. (Sorry, it's hard to explain, check out the post if you didn't get that.)

So currently, people are losing lots of money to these sneaky scams. I could very well see a dark future where I myself let my guard down when selling some ETH to get on the property ladder one day and when I go to transfer the funds to an exchange, I click the wrong account since it's right there at the top of my wallet's history and boom. My hopes and dreams of stability in where I live are gone for years to come.

***Just imagine thinking you can finally buy a house for your family and then at the last minute one slip up and that whole dream was taken from you. This has happened to people before and it will happen again.***

But this is completely avoidable! This is an extremely easy issue to solve. While it would be nice to get everyone to have better OpSec, it's not going to happen. However, one really minor tweak to Etherscan and it could be solved. 

1. They could add a simple bit of code to either display the Jazzicon/block profile pic next to every wallet address. This way, even though it is small, one could see that the address is different since the colour/design is different.

2. They could add some code to flag wallets which have similar starting and ending letters. It could be a simple orange warning sign or something which has more info if you have over it or a big banner if you actually click on said wallet.

Best of all, Etherscan is good at this sort of stuff usually. They added a revoke token permissions app to prevent those affected by exploits and that was a much more complicated addition. On the simpler side, they tag known scam wallets as such.

So I'd like this to be a call to action for this community. We have done this before. Previously when we have wanted to get an idea broadcast out to the wider Ethereum community or a certain protocol, we have been able to do it if we all do our part. **So please, if anyone knows someone who works for Etherscan or if you have followers/influence on other platforms like Twitter. Please, tell Etherscan to automatically flag dust attack wallets.** If we are successful, we could successfully save many people from losing their life savings to this avoidable tragedy.

This is quite possibly one of the easiest changes which could be made to prevent a lot of money from falling into the wrong hands.

Edit: I guess this also should be done in wallets too like MetaMask. So why stop at Etherscan? Let's make a fuss to every wallet provider which doesn't have some kind of system to prevent this. It should be as simple as if you shorten wallet addresses, have a kind of warning bubble if there are similar addresses you have previously sent funds to.

<summary>u/TheHansGruber is grateful for retroactive public goods funding</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1apmglo/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2024/kq86iof/)

As some of you may know, since the launch of the holesky testnet last September I have been maintaining and testing several thousand genesis validators alongside a dozen or so other meganerds from the rocketpool community. This is in spite of the fact that I almost **certainly** am responsible for bringing the average IQ of this group down a couple of points.

Over the last few months I have picked up a number of skills required for this sort of thing and I get a great deal of satisfaction knowing I am contributing in a small way to the development and progression of ethereum. I'll have these guys running for as long as the testnet needs 'em.

Anyway...I am proud to be able to say that, as of yesterday, I have received my **first ever** retroactive public goods funding from the folks over at ethstaker for operating these validators. Some months ago u/nixorokish posted in here about there being the possibility of a small grant/funding, and I inquired. I have a little extra pep in my step today. It isn't a huge pile of cash or anything, it's only meant to cover most of the cost of operating the machines. But it *feels* like a huge pile of cash to me, because for the first time I have tangible proof that I am, in fact, doing *something useful* in the space...other than shitposting on CT and farcaster, which I will contrinue to do regardless.

<summary>u/OkDragonfruit1929 summarises Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1apmglo/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2024/kq8ornt/)

Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it's a platform for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and various decentralized finance projects. This ecosystem supports a wide range of applications, from finance and gaming to art and identity verification and tokenization of real-world assets and tokenization of commodities, offering a utility that goes infinitely beyond what Bitcoin was designed for. Bitcoin primarily serves as digital gold or a store of value, whereas Ethereum aims to be an open, transparent, equitable settlement layer for the entire planet.

The Ethereum network has spawned numerous Layer 2 solutions (L2s) like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, which aim to scale the network by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, thereby increasing throughput and reducing fees. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, which has largely remained focused on Layer 1 (L1) with some off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network, which is dying in front of our eyes. The growth and adoption of L2s arguably add to Ethereum's utility and value. With zero-knowledge proofs coming sooner than anyone expects, liquidity fragmentation between the L2s and L1 will soon be a thing of the past.

Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Merge significantly altered its issuance model and energy consumption. In PoS, validators stake ETH to secure the network, which is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) model. The issuance model under PoS is designed to be fairer and more sustainable, with rewards not exponentially weighted toward the ultra-wealthy with exponentially more computational power, but on rather on a linear model that scales fairly with the amount of ETH staked. This levels the playing field for earning transaction fees and block rewards, contrasting with Bitcoin's model where mining power concentration can lead to extreme disparities in earning potential where the APR of the ultra-wealthy is magnitudes higher than the APR allotted to the lower 99%.

EIP-1559 introduced a mechanism for burning a portion of transaction fees, reducing the overall supply of ETH over time. This deflationary pressure is unique compared to Bitcoin's currently inflating supply until it finally caps at 21 million. The fee market mechanism of Ethereum also aims to make transaction fees more predictable.

Ethereum's ecosystem supports multiple client implementations, fostering a diverse and resilient network. This diversity can reduce the risk of network-wide failures due to bugs in a single client implementation, a contrast to the single point of failure landscape of Bitcoin's one and only client.
  
Despite these advantages, the market valuation of ETH compared to BTC has been far too heavily influenced by narrative, "store-of-value" meme-ability, speculation, investor sentiment, and market dynamics. While Ethereum's technological and ecosystem advancements provide ETH a stronger value proposition, the market has failed to notice.

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

In case no one has mentioned this, to check your STRK eligibility on an Ethereum address, you have to go to the [claim page](https://provisions.starknet.io) and click the third tab on the left before you enter the address. This is kind of a confusing ux.

Here's what the claim page looks like after you click the third tab: <https://ibb.co/KVX2C4S>

And the claim may be based on your deposit address or your withdrawal address, so check both if you don't see it.

I think all pre-merge beacon chain depositors are eligible.

Don't forget to appreciate Starknet for being the first airdrop to show significant support to the solo/home staking community!

Also, it looks like Rocket Pool stakers aren't able to claim right now, but I'm aware of internal discussions that are very like to conclude with Rocket Pool node operators claiming STRK.

<summary>u/TheHansGruber is looking into cool new staking hardware</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ag42lq/daily_general_discussion_february_1_2024/kofe3ed/)

Spent some time at the rack last night. Updating the staking machines, swapping some patch cables, etc. I've got a new (to me) managed POE+ switch I'm pretty excited about. Gonna learn how to do vlan stuff for better security, and so I can install some POE cameras. Gotta rent a trenching machine and bury some cable too...not really excited about that part.

In going down the POE rabbit hole I came across a couple of interesting POE devices...including a POE NUC...which is *awesome*. It's priced like enterprise grade hardware...because it is. But a fanless, POE NUC that has the processing power to stake, yet is power efficient enough to be able to operate over POE is the *dream*. I already have the machine I'll be using as a nodeset operator setup, but I am considering throwing my hat into operation solo staker with etherfi too. If I could just hit one of these lottery blocks people keep talking about I would consider grabbing one of these POE NUCs. 

While doing my normal monitoring I noticed that, on mainnet validators, the rewards per epoch have begun to consistently drop below 10,000 gwei...and I wonder if we will ever see 5 figure rewards epochs again. Holesky validators never saw 10xxx gwei rewards...it launched with *well* over a million validators...I think we have closer to 1.5 million validating currently. These lil guys are receiving 7xxx gwei per epoch. Will we see 1.5 million active validators on mainnet? I'm guessing that might be close to the upper limit of what people will accept as a return on their investment. Depending on what restaking does to overall APR, of course. I don't have enough info to begin to speculate on that.

The dencun upgrade went boringly (good!) on sepolia, and after updating the holesky machine the consensus client log reads "INFO Ready for Deneb". Me too, computer. Me too. Mainnet soon after.

<summary>u/benido2030 gives us a comprehensive rundown on restaking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1agwsik/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2024/kokjg1b/)

**What is restaking?** 

I will try to explain using EigenLayer as an example, following up on u/stablecoins post, but also because I have seen a lot of comments/ questions and think the concept isn't really clear. Please keep in mind that I am also writing this to structure my thoughts, but am not an expert at all, so things here might be wrong. If you spot mistakes, please correct them! 

*What is the general idea of restaking?*

Restaking means that we use capital that is staked to secure Ethereum - both staked ETH in validators but also via LSTs - and *also* use it to secure something else (and something else). 

*What kind of things can be secured by restaking?*

Basically anything. It could be an oracle. A data availability solution. An L2/ appchain. Anything that needs security.  

*Why is this needed?* 

Bootstrapping security for a new protocol is hard, especially if you want the validator set to be decentralized. Eigenlayer wants to be "a marketplace for trust". On this marketplace protocols that need trust/ security can tap into the already existing staked capital that Ethereum offers and build on that. Eigenlayer's thesis is that this is way easier than building it on your own. Their argument also builds on web2: Why have your own servers/ authentication etc. when you can just build in the cloud (e.g. AWS) or use Auth0 etc. = existing solutions that allow you to focus on your core product. 

Important: the existing solution is **not** Eigenlayer, but the security offered by stakers / holders of LSTs. 

*So how does this marketplace = Eigenlayer work?*

New protocols that want to build on Eigenlayer basically define what kind of trust/ security they need. This comes down to: Do they want only solo / home stakers to secure their network? Or are LSTs okay as well? 

At the same time they define what they are willing to offer for that service: How much are they willing to pay for securing their network? This could be in ETH, their native token etc. 

Also they of course define what the restakers have to do to secure the network. This means they provide a software/ client that the restakers have to run to secure the protocol. This is similar to what stakers run with execution and consensus clients to secure Ethereum. All these are called "AVSs". Actively validated services. Actively. Someone needs to do an action. 

Restakers start by either creating an Eigenpod or by depositing LSTs. An Eigenpod is a smart contract that a validator points to. So if a validator wants to exit the beaconchain, the ETH goes to the Eigenpod first. Similarly by depositing LSTs into Eigenlayer you deposit it into a smart contract. If the restaker wants to exit Eigenlayer there is a 7 day period before they can finally really withdraw their assets. 

This means that the assets don't leave the validator or the Eigenlayer smart contract. The secured protocol does **not** control the assets. 

After depositing restakers then opt-in if they are willing to secure the new protocol. They accept the offer made by the protocol, run the client and secure the network and are paid for this service according to the terms. 

There will also be operators that run the clients for you. So the restaker deposits, but delegates the actual management of the clients to a 3rd party. In that case you obviously *trust* someone else to do the job of securing correctly. Just like you do with LSTs or dPoS in other ecosystems. These operators of course ask for a fee to do that. 

If they behave according to the protocols rules (= they secure the protocol as intended) they are paid. If they misbehave (=they attack the protocol they are supposed to secure) they can be slashed just like someone could be slashed on the beaconchain. 

So how does the slashing work now? If they are caught, the protocol can ask Eigenlayer to slash the restaker. Eigenlayer right now has a "slashing committee" (my term, don't know if that's the real name of it). This committee basically checks if the restaker really misbehaved and if the slashing request is fair. So right now a protocol can't just slash you as a restaker, there is a (centralized!) security mechanism in place. 

If the restaker indeed attacked the network, they can't withdraw their LSTs and the LSTs are slashed. If they have a validator right now (!) no one can force them to exit the validator, so they can continue validating Ethereum. But when they want to exit, they will withdraw to the eigenpod and then the Eigenlayer protocol can slash the portion that is supposed to be slashed before the restaker can withdraw the rest. 

I don't know what happens to the assets that are being slashed. Maybe someone can add that? Are those burned? Going to the protocol that did the slashing? (That would be a strange incentive, but maybe that's the case)

*So where does the yield come from?*

First of all: There is **no** **yield** by just depositing. Only if you start securing one (or more) protocols, you will receive yield. This also means that right now there is only smart contract risk, no slashing etc. 

This yield is what these protocols offer to restakers for their service securing the new protocol. It can be paid in different tokens (or a mix). Could be new issuance. Could be from their treasury. Could be part of the fees they make with the product running on top. 

\---

But Benido, this all sounds great, I was told Eigenlayer is a huge risk, I don't get it, that is like risk free yield on top of risk free yield?

If you were around in spring of 2022, you might remember 3AC (Three Arrows Capital). They were long when the market was going down and at one point lending firms ask for more capital from 3AC. What did 3AC do? They used the same collateral over and over again. So what happened? All lending firms found out that the collateral they thought they could liquidate ("slash") was posted as collateral with other lenders as well. 3AC basically "restaked" the same collateral over and over again. No lending firm could liquidate the collateral and they all went tits up, the whole market crashed and it was a dark time... 

Of course this was off chain and Eigenlayer is onchain. With restaking we *know* how many times a certain asset is used to secure a certain protocol. But in the end something similar could happen. Deposit asset X once, attack several protocols and all protocols find out that they can't slash, because it was slashed already. 

On top we could see borrowing and lending protocols that allow LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens) to be deposited. So an attacker could even borrow against it to acquire more and attack cheaply... 

Using the same collateral several times is something that can be abused. Yes, it's onchain, so more transparent, but that doesn't make it bullet proof. We will witness attacks. This might lead to a cascade of liquidations and could take down so many protocols... and always remember: These assets started as stake to secure Ethereum, in a worst case scenario ETH's security might be diminished and attacks might be possible in ways we can't even imagine today. 

\---

I hope this explains restaking, but it might just be more confusing because I am missing things, the structure sucks etc., I don't know. If you have questions, post them!

<summary>u/alexiskef introduces POAP Global, a cool new use case!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ahp76i/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2024/kosf4nd/)

Exciting news for the POAP enthusiasts!

[Poap Global](https://www.poap.global/), a project which is not officially related to POAP but rather a community project that utilizes the POAP tools, [just had](https://x.com/poapglobal/status/1753540429956403227?s=20) their official launch!

(Before publishing this comment, I asked Patricio Worthalter, the POAP founder, regarding the projects legitimacy, and he gave me a thumbs-up: ***"Yes! We support them.*** *The founder is a valued member of the official POAP curation body. This is a side gig")*

So, I went through their website and will try to explain what they are, and what it is that they are launching!

**What is Poap Global**? It's a "*a groundbreaking extension of the proof of attendance protocol concept operated by hodl labs. Imagine being part of a worldwide irl scavenger hunt. Only in this game, the treasures are unique digital collectibles at every landmark, and the playground is planet earth"*

**How do you participate?** *"You can either ‚Äú****host****‚Äù a poap at a location of your choice or travel and* ***collect*** *other people‚Äôs poaps!"*

**Hosts**  
*You can 'host' a poap at a location of your choosing. Whether it's a favorite hiking trail, a landmark, or a hidden gem in your city, you can make it a part of this global game.*

So, how can you be a "Host"?  Well, there are 3 steps:

1. Submit location. You first choose a landmark, then design a POAP and submit it..  
2. Purchase a POAP NFC dispenser from their store. This is designed to be installed in proximity to your selected landmark. Visitors will be able to tap their phone against the nfc to instantly receive your special poap for that location.  
3. Program dispenser. When you first receive your dispenser you will be given a menu to select your approved poap and program it to the nfc. 

There is also a Global Leaderboard (in the works) to "*showcase top explorers and collectors",* and a *"dynamic globe that pinpoints where all the poaps are hidden".*

**Collectors**  
As a traveler and explorer, you can embark on a journey to collect poaps from various locations hosted by others. It‚Äôs a digital treasure hunt that takes you to new and exciting places.

The idea seems to be a perfect use-case on how to further utilize the POAP protocol. I jumped right in and bought a small number of the NFC dispensers.. I plan to "install" them at my home town center and at my local sports teams' soccer grounds..

There is a learning curve and documentation needs some improvement, knowledge is silod within discord and in some case you are at the mercy of support from dev team. I learned a lot, definetly more comfortable sharing and talking about different clients, node and confident that I can help someone strugling with running a node.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aigxis/daily_general_discussion_february_4_2024/koxv56l/)

Naw, this is pretty wise, even though it means you won't get an early participant advantage IF restaking is successful.

In 2009, people who took a risk on bitcoin did well.

In 2014, people who took a risk on Ether tokens did well.

In 2015, people who took a risk on The DAO we're bailed out in a one-time network fork.

In 2017, people who invested in ICOs like EOS lost lots of money on products that never materialized. 

There's really no way to say what will happen with restaking. I'm not convinced that there's a large enough market to support what's being built- maybe it will develop or maybe it'll just trend toward other solutions. All of this is a risk and it's wise to wait and see. As I've said publicly, I'm okay missing a huge win, and I'm going into all of these opportunities with a total of about 1% of my coins. I'm okay with any outcome.

I can sense that a lot of my investment-oriented friends think I'm just being negative, but I'm here for the long term success of Ethereum, not the flavor of the week. Just be who you are üòä

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aj9j2n/daily_general_discussion_february_5_2024/kp4lj3x/)

Toni and Vitalik put together an [ethresear.ch post on increasing the block gas limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-increasing-the-block-gas-limit/18567). This topic had moment in the spotlight a few weeks ago when Vitalik suggested we might be able to handle a block size increase and kicked off a flood of discussion. I haven't seen as much social media fuss recently, but with this post we're getting into the research of if to do it, and how to do so safely. Their strategy for increasing the gas limit? Decreasing it first! Kinda.

The trouble is that large blocks are possibly an issue today, even without an increase. There's a great figure in the post showing that reorged blocks tended to be almost two times larger (in bytes) than blocks that get finalized. Discussion about confounding factors aside, it does seem to suggest that a naive gas limit increase would hurt consensus health.

But block size comes in a distribution. The biggest blocks are a problem, but the median block size is 14.5x smaller than the maximum possible, very conservatively low. So what Toni and Vitalik are aiming to do is *decrease* the maximum block size and reduce variance so that we can safely *increase* the average block size.

With blobs coming up soon, the central idea is to increase the gas cost of calldata, the current way of getting data to the EVM. Increasing the gas cost of calldata means that blocks can hold less before they fill up, so we get a reduction in max block size. Then we could feel safe increasing the gas limit somewhat, presumably making space for more EVM execution, rather than data storage, to occur. And possibly make room for more blobs per slot.

The post has 5 different suggestions for how to do this. Personally, I like multi-dimensional EIP-1559 with a separate market for calldata, but the post argues that may be overly complex.

<summary>u/Set1Less warns us about a bad experience with a certain smart wallet</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aj9j2n/daily_general_discussion_february_5_2024/kp23kga/)

After many years in crypto. I seem to have run into the first instance of "losing" my wallet which is an account abstraction wallet from Particle Network(Ally.build created for the Linea tasks) created through signing in with email or twitter/discord, but Im unable to recover it for whatever reason. Apparently I may have used a different email or social account but I doubt that - I have tried logging back in with all my accounts and various combos, but it only loads a brand new wallet and not the ones which had the funds in it. The particle network discord is filled with people complaining about losing access to their wallet and the only reply they are getting is "read faq"

If you are a crypto native, using an AA wallet seems rather pointless - not only does it create a dependancy on a centralized wallet provider (another example is people losing access to Argent) but also bugs and or glitches can lead to you losing your wallet


Update: Particle wallet seems to be extremely poorly designed. There are multiple channels on their discord with people complaining about being unable to access their funds. Seems signing in with the original social media/email account sometimes results in a brand new wallet being created, and not the earlier wallet that was in use and funded by users. Whats worse is that the team is not willing to accept there is an issue, but instead seem to hold their ground that everything is working as expected -  despite hundreds of users complaining about being locked out of their wallets. The fact that so many people have the same issue in accessing their wallet at the very least requires the wallet team to look at the issue more closely, instead of firing off "Read FAQ" template messages...

Its shameful that Linea are using such operators for points scheme where scores of users are unable to even access the wallet they created earlier. 

At this point I can only warn others from using any wallet related to Particle network including Ally.Build

<summary>u/696_eth starts a discussion about securing your stack</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ak2vf5/daily_general_discussion_february_6_2024/kp9mmkd/)

Caught up on the last few dayllies and I've seen a feel people lose a lot. Can we talk about securing our bags a bit and thinking of how to avoid losing the entire stack? yes, it's an unpleasant to thing to think about but I'd rather do it and not get rekt completely.

I'll start with some of the things that I do and remember off the top of my head and feel free to chime in w others.

* Whenever the link is needed, especially important for airdrop claims or something big money related, go to the official source and even 2 to double check rather than clicking on whatever you see or someone sent you.

* If somebody or something is rushing you to make a decision quickly - quite likely it is a scam. Even if it's not a scam, you are losing out on a potential opportunity (no matter how gen wealth that opportunity is) but saving your bags. If you still have the bags then you can capitalize on future opportunities. 

* Don't download anything that's given to you in the crypto world. Sometimes people dm me with links and even trusted people and I tell them I wouldnt download any files even if I trust them cause what if they got hacked and now somebody is targeting me.

<summary>u/SikhSoldiers shares his latest write up about RocketPool</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1akw42k/daily_general_discussion_february_7_2024/kpg2ovy/)

It has been a long time since I've made a top level post here it feels like. Alas, that's what medical school does to a person. I am back to share with everyone my first major writing piece in over a year - 

Hybrid Theory: Rocket Pool's Middle Way Between Native Liquid Restaking and Pure Staking.

The Rocket Pool pDAO will soon be voting on allowing, alterning, or denying my proposed integration bounty. This essay outlines why I think it's a good idea for Rocket Pool, Eigenlayer, and Ethereum writ large. 

The broad idea is that we can enable node operators to join Eigenlayer without adding risk to rETH holders if we integrate in a way that retains senior debt for rocket pool. I dub this hybrid restaking. The essay goes through all the different ways people can restake today and outlines their flaws. 

Hybrid restaking enables permsionless node operators to be sustainably profit maxi without harming rETH. Rocket Pool node operators could experience many airdrops and yield from different AVS services. 

I am happy to answer any (sincere) questions.

<summary>u/superphiz updates us on client diversity moves and the Ethfinanciers who are helping us to track the situation. And u/alexiskef chimes in with a positive reply after putting pressure on Consensys.</summary>

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

You should know that the tide toward client diversity is changing dramatically. I'd like to thank the folks who have supported this work and those who have provided great updates here and I'd 100% encourage you to continue engaging in that community service role.

On January 22, 2024, Brian Armstrong from [Coinbase responded to DCInvestor](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1749552489509392696) to say that he was [taking a look](https://checkout.poap.xyz/167170/crypto?step=1) at client diversity within Coinbase's staking operation and they'll report back in February. If they continue to suggest that other clients aren't mature enough, we'll wonder why Coinbase is [utilizing open source software without contributing back](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1750199002056769994) to the code base as would be expected.

[AllNodes](https://twitter.com/Allnodes/status/1750519886286295117), [p2p.org](https://twitter.com/P2Pvalidator/status/1750550082934472885), and [Anker](https://twitter.com/Archer_MD_/status/1750892604584001975) announced switching to minority clients within the past 24 hours. This switch is a great illustration of how efficiently large operations CAN shift clients if they choose to. The value of these victories, and the contributions by their respective contributors cannot be overstated. Thank you, Allnodes, P2P.org and Anker.

After an initially [tone deaf defense](https://twitter.com/cryptoQuoc/status/1749572714833027494), Stakefish seems to be [changing its tune](https://twitter.com/stakefish/status/1750216552979251490) a bit, but despite a reference to the responsibility of client diversity, there's little apparent commitment to make real changes, so lets watch this one closely.

Lido operators represent the [largest group](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=pool&timeWindow=1d&page=1&poolType=all) of validator operators, and [our data suggests](https://execution-diversity.info/) that they're still highly reliant on geth. /u/yorickdowne has been a great advocate for decentralization from within lido, as a node operator for reducing the supermajority client, but the push hasn't been very successful yet. I'm optimistic that at some point they'll act in their own best interest.

Hanni Abu's [ClientDiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/) is our best view into client diversity, and the execution client data currently sourced by word of mouth. While I look forward to more and better data, I deeply appreciate and value this source.

I'd like to send good vibes to everyone who is working on this front, groups like [EthStaker](https://ethstaker.cc), led by /u/nixorokish, [Jasper the Friendly Ghost](https://twitter.com/drjasper_eth), who is pouring his passion into this [and I sure af hope he's still thriving in med school], and [Anthony Sassano who, through The Daily Gwei](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDailyGwei), beats this drum CONTINUOUSLY, also /u/interweaver for reaching out to providers and educating about the risks of a majoriy client fault. And perhaps the biggest thanks to /u/hanniabu through [EtherAlpha](https://etheralpha.org/) who tirelessly develops data that enables all of us to see the threats ahead of us. Without his efforts we'd be flying blind toward a black hole.

None of this even mentions the deep and detailed academic work and research going into client diversity. Thanks to /u/haurog for providing [insight into the academic and EIP efforts](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1abbg8a/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2024/kjmr7ds/).

For my part, I'm continuing to go back to home stakers as the best future for the network. Giving lots of control of the network to third parties with little or nothing at stake is dangerous and undermines the goal of a decentralized network. If you have any way to stake from home, as a solo staker, Rocket Pool operator, DVT operator - whatever - I really encourage you to do that.

I've started a [very [very] basic document](https://github.com/superphiz/topics/blob/master/execution_client_diversity.txt) to help us track these events, please feel free to hop in and help develop it as you see fit.

üòä More good news on the client diversity front!

About 4 days ago, both u/0xboba and [myself](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19cou8k/comment/kj262g4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (following the [news](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/199j5zi/comment/kig0g1y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that ü¶ä/Consensys have began [offering](https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1747999337068531882?t=RoFikSJPwUiEelTRc1RZFw&s=19) their users the ability to stake through their "own" validators), were wondering if anyone knew which Execution (and Consensus) clients Consensys Metamask Staking are using..

So, I contacted Consensys, who directed me to ü¶ä support.. I asked the following:

*"What are the client combinations (EL/CL) that my validators will be running? I understand from some (very) basic information the MM Staking web page provides, that you "operate diverse validator clients and distributed infrastructure hosted across multiple regions and cloud providers‚Äù, but in light of the recent software bugs in Besu and Nethermind, I need to know that my capital is not at risk by depending on a super-majority client like Geth"*

They answered by just pointing me to some vague articles on their support page.. I pressed on, asking for details, and they just answered!

*"As a company, Consensys is deeply committed to client diversity: we are developing an Execution Layer client (BESU) and a Consensus Layer client (Teku). Consensys Staking infrastructure uses an algorithm to distribute validators across multiple Execution and Consensus Layer clients. On the consensus layer, we run 2 clients for validator duties: Teku and Lighthouse. Our algorithm allocates new validators to Teku or Lighthouse to maintain a 50%-50% split between Teku and Lighthouse across the entire platform. On the execution layer, we currently run the majority of Geth.* ***Our top priority is to increase BESU's footprint: we aim to reach 50% of BESU in the coming weeks before the end of February.*** *After the Merge, Consensys Staking evaluated the use of BESU and provided feedback and support to improve performances, in order to optimise rewards for End Users. The BESU team worked tirelessly, releasing new features such as a fully flat state DB and other improvements that bring BESU much closer to Geth performances.* ***We started BESU rollout across our platform and will iteratively increase BESU's footprint to reach 50% of all validators we operate before the end of February 2024****. This progressive rollout aims to ensure no or limited performance degradation for our users. Beyond client diversity, Consensys Staking validators are distributed across 2 clouds (Azure, AWS) and 6 regions (2 in the US, 2 in Europe and 2 in Asia)"*

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ac3zs6/daily_general_discussion_january_27_2024/kjui3k7/)

[u/nixorokish](https://reddit.com/u/nixorokish):

i tried out the keystone hardware wallet and wrote up some thoughts on it: https://twitter.com/nixorokish/status/1751319725274214825

i had more criticisms than praise and feel pretty lukewarm on it    
summary:

- typo on the verification screen indicates a lack of attention to detail to me
- couldn't get software update to work on web. could have tried the SD card method but then i would have had to go find my SD card converter thingy and i couldn't be bothered. So instead of using frame, which is what i would normally use, i just decided to try out Rabby
- too much QR back and forth. probably mobile-wallet friendly but when i'm using a desktop software wallet, it is an absolute pain in the butt that all the keystone stuff is just QR codes. there's no way to scan a QR code with my computer when i'm trying to send some test money from my coinbase account
- refresh rate feels janky. scrolling isn't easy on the eyes
- the screen is easily scratched
- there's not a clear point to start from on the screen. it basically defaults to a settings page, where you can add more wallets and chains. i wish there were a dashboard type of screen where you could see all existing wallets instead of having to click "Ethereum" first to see your Ethereum wallets. i guess maybe that's just me as an ETH maxi though, I'm likely not going to have any other chains to click on in the near future

I doooo like

- the constant haptic feedback (i think this is an optional setting)
- the size of the screen and device itself
- clear signing page
- biometrics (fingerprint) to unlock and sign txs

kinda wanna try the Hito next. what i REALLY want is for Grid+ to make a smaller, travel-friendly wallet

[u/alexiskef](https://reddit.com/u/alexiskef):

Huh! I actually saw your comment during Xmas (the one telling us you were going to try it..) and.. bought one right there and then!

I was actually meaning to ask you about your initial impression! 

Personally, I have been more than happy with it. To the point where it has replaced my Ledger play-money wallet!

I too encountered an initial software upgrade problem, but everything worked at my second attempt.

I see what you mean with the too-much-QR codes, however that IS how the device works.. And on that note, I'll add that both the scanning by the device (of the laptop QR) AND the blurred scanning by my laptop (of the wallet QRs), works flawlessly and super fast.. I find myself going through txs much faster than with my Ledger..

I do agree with you on the "start page" point. It IS quite confusing. I too initially wanted an "anchor" type of screen. Possibly (as you said), with a clear list of my wallets.. 

However, after reading more on the way the device works, I came across the article which explains the security provisions for multiple wallets.. The device loads each wallet with a different (seed phrase) AND pin. And you can only have one wallet active.. This is quite logical, as only YOU know the number of wallets (seed phrases) that are loaded (but hidden). This wouldn't be possible with an "anchor" screen.. And even if users did not care for all their wallets to be listed on that screen, they'd still need to input a (different) pin, each and every time they went back onto that screen and selected a wallet..

My screen has not been scratched so far, but I do see your point here.. I am very (too..) careful while using and storing it.. I already ordered the pouch from their website..

I do also like the screen size, the clear signing info, and most importantly the biometrics..

One other thing I have to add, is that I got really really confused when trying to connect it to my (already Ledger-connected) Metamask extension.. As in super confused.. 

So I downloaded Rabby (thank you u/superphiz), and started fresh.. Everything made sense right there..

<summary>u/pa7x1 clarifies the fact that not all slashing is equal.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ac3zs6/daily_general_discussion_january_27_2024/kjsdhlc/)

Most people confuse the different penalties the protocol may apply, because we tend to be a bit lazy with the penalties and call everything slashing. But there are different penalties. Slashing is just one of them and is almost impossible to trigger by a bug. And even when it happens due to operator mistake it slashes for 1 ETH. Just so you can see it directly, here is a very recent slashing.

<https://beaconcha.in/validator/1061987>

This validator lost 1 ETH (and a bit extra due to missed attestations after, but rounds to nothing) and is exited. But if there had been a mass slashing affecting many people, then the correlation penalty and inactivity leak kicks in, that's what can take you to total loss of capital.

So as I was thinking about it these days I noticed that mixing all the penalties under slashing might be partly why we have supermajority issues. Nobody wants to lose money for something they don't have control of. Much like people tend to fear traveling in airplanes more because the situation is out of your control. So losing your stack because of a bug you have no responsibility of is avoided, and everyone flocks to the client that is perceived safest. 

But this is the wrong mental model of the network penalties, the network is not gonna punish you for uncorrelated issues because it's designed to work under imperfect conditions. So this doesn't really bother the network. If you have a bug with a very minor client you may be offline and missing attestations a few hours, maybe a day. That's nothing, penalties for that are very small. You would need to be 60% of the year offline to lose money for inactivity. That's how small those penalties are, a few hours here and there is not even something you can feel. 

But if it loses at least 1/3 of the validators then the protocol gets pissed, because it cannot fulfill its duties. And then punishes, and can punish very heavily. The penalties here are the inactivity leak and the correlation penalty. This is what you should fear. 

So the **TL;DR** of the story is that you shouldn't fear client bugs per se. You should fear having the same bug as many people, that's what triggers severe penalties. And the good news is that you have total control over it. You have the choice to not suffer significant loss of capital. It's entirely on you. Choose minority clients.

I would highly recommend anyone interested in Ethereum's upcoming upgrades read Christine Kim's notes on this week's ACDC call. They contain a fantastic review of some of the EIPs under consideration for the Prague/Electra small-feature hardfork currently being targeted from the end of 2024, prior to the Verkle fork coming after it. 

Only a few relatively small (but important) EIPs have been tentatively scheduled for inclusion; some of the slightly larger ticket items are still under debate, mostly because client devs believe including them would push Prague/Electra into 2025.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard shines a light on the darker side of this space</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ado855/daily_general_discussion_january_29_2024/kk6dv9i/)

I usually think of the minimum requirements for a PoW system as:

1) There is basically infinite work to do. We can't have the consensus of the chain halt because it's waiting for work to arrive.

2) Anyone can do work and submit a proof of that work for verification. If this was limited to known entities they could form a cabal that halt or at least slow the chain at will.

3) Anyone can verify/validate how much work was done objectively (at least statistically). We have to be able to reach consensus on how much to reward each miner. Again, anonymity and open access prevents effective conspiracies.

4) Validation takes far less time than it took to do the work. A system that relies on massive redundant computation for consensus will have to compensate too much per unit work done to be economically effective in the long run (looking at you Bitcoin).

In my [previous post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18luu66/daily_general_discussion_december_19_2023/ke2fw3x/?context=3) I talked about GenSyn which swapped out useless hashing for useful model training and the economic potential of such a solution. AI training just happens to be a task that meets all these criteria. There is basically infinite demand for AI training. I can think of a few other tasks such as protein folding (folding at home) or private key cracking but most computational tasks don't meet these criteria and even some of those that do wouldn't have much economic value. As such, while Gensyn seemed to have a neat idea, it didn't seem to be a paradigm shift so much as a cool footnote in history. *However*, what happens if we relax requirement 3 a bit and allow for subjective consensus?

"But Logris, what the hell is subjective consensus?" Glad you asked! Basically it's group think for deciding on things with no objective answer. The most common example of this is every oracle you've ever known. Smart contracts can only refer to chain state. They can't see BTC price feeds on Kraken for example. All data that is off-chain is subjective from the perspective of the chain. Consensus on that data is decided subjectively by oracles. But not all oracles work alike. Chainlink is optimized for a small number of data streams with high liveness. UMA is optimized for the long-tail of queries with latency that can be measured in days.

The interesting part about UMA in my opinion is they apply a commit-reveal scheme and use stake to keep people honest. All participants submit their data in an encrypted way before a deadline, then submit the decryption keys for that data after the deadline when no answer can be changed. The do something like average the result and people with answers too far from the mean lose some of their stake. The obvious Schelling point for a submission is *the truth*. Expecting the average to be anything but that requires a conspiracy of submitters to distort the data. Unless you believe such a conspiracy exists, the rational answer to submit is the truest one you can find. All you're really doing is measuring what *you believe* everyone else *will believe*, but in practice this works well when there is an *objective* answer rather than something either unknown or disputed. You could imagine how this could be used for anything: "Did Trump lose the 2020 election?". I expect you'd get a very different answer if you shoved that question through this system than if you polled the average US voter. Honestly, I expect you'd get a better one.

So what would happen if you applied something like UMA consensus to a PoW blockchain? Addressing the points above in order.

1) You would still need a stream of continuous work for miners to do. Either that work has to be submitted by validators or it needs to be self-evident to miners. Nothing here says the work has to actually be useful, just eventually verifiable.

2) You still need permissionless mining but if the work isn't self-evident the network may need some type of sampling to throttle the participants which means you'll need miner stake for Sybil resistance.

3) Validation would still be permissionless but validators would definitely need stake for subjective consensus to function.

4) This is basically unchanged but I will note that nothing says payouts in a blockchain have to be immediate. It's totally fine if people receive their payout a couple days later. That said, you want consensus to happen continuously so you probably want each participant running a program rather than manually voting.

What types of tasks could you now do that you previously couldn't have? In order of least to highest villainy:

1) Miners provide DePIn resources like data availability; Validators validate using data sampling.

2) Miners submit a predictive price of the S&P 500 for the next day; Validators grade it retroactively. If this ever gets competitive it will distort global markets as large players buy and sell to make their predictions come true.

If you're willing to have the validators create synthetic work to fill in any gaps as well:

3) Break web2 Sybil resistance. Full multi-model media. Solve Captchas for bots so they can break into accounts easier. Create fake videos and images for KYC for identity thieves. Create explicit photos of Taylor Swift and distribute them on a data availability layer. Create Fake news for Russia to destroy democracies. Entirely peer to peer and anonymously. Destroy society as we know it.

<summary>u/OkDragonfruit1929 introduces one of the up and coming execution clients, Silkworm</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1afauzq/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2024/kobrpgb/)

Because of the recent push for client diversity, I've been researching a few of the alpha and pre-alpha EL clients in the works, and the Silkworm Ethereum client has me really excited. I'm always looking out for new and innovative projects that can push the technology forward.
  
Silkworm aims to be the fastest Ethereum client while still maintaining high code quality and readability. That combination really appeals to me - performance without sacrificing robustness or security. The fact that it builds on top of the well-regarded geth/Erigon codebase, but uses a completely different programming language gives me confidence that the developers know what they're doing.
  
I also like Silkworm's use of more modern C++ standards and the libmdbx database engine. Adopting C++20 features and leveraging a high-performance embedded database seems like a recipe for speed.
  
I'm eager to try it out once testnet builds are available. The documentation around building and testing Silkworm locally is already pretty good.
   
Overall, I think the team has laid out a compelling technical vision with Silkworm. If they can deliver on faster sync and execution times without reducing decentralization or security, it could be a big win for Ethereum. I'll be following the project closely as it develops.

<summary>u/proof-of-lake shares some thoughts on points</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1afauzq/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2024/kobkudg/)

IMO, points have been developing a bad rep mostly for nothing.

(Though I will say, there are two fairly different approaches, and one is worse than the other).

What's good about points:

-they let teams be explicit about the sorts of user behaviour they want (to drive adoption or growth)

-they allow teams to evolve and develop those goals in a way that supports real-time testing and feedback (so for example, "how will user behaviour change if we tweak these variables and incentives?")

-they give teams a chance to "claw back" or change these metrics quite rapidly if needed (something that is harder to do if a token incentive program is already live and running) 

-they reduce Sybil airdrop farming because they generally relate to actual capital (x time) being put in, or at least, to behaviours that are deemed desirable and useful by the protocol team

-they give users who *are* keen to pursue a token allocation some transparency, prior to token generation (meaning you can see where you sit overall relative to other users, and you know what behaviours will be "rewarded" and whether your time and effort is being well directed).

For all these reasons, points seem to me to be (on balance) a logical development that has mostly been positive.

*However* - what I will say is that it begins to cross the line once too much gamification is brought in. By this I mean instances in which teams make their points program too complex, too casino-like, and too demanding: countless fancy ranks and tiers, NFTs and badges, quests, pointless or tangential tasks (daily check-ins??) super aggressive referral programs, etc. 

These are the ones that (to me) feel exploitative and annoying. I'd sadly put EtherFi in this category, even though I think the team is legit and the core product makes sense. Orbiter has trended this way too.

Eigenlayer's points, on the other hand, look simple, justifiable and useful.

So next time you're thinking about points, start by asking - what's the point? Sometimes there is one! ...but to any devs out there - don't make it a carnival game, please.

When you were partying, I studied the blade. When you were having premarital sex, I mastered the blockchain. While you wasted your days on crypto twitter in pursuit of vanity, I farmed eigenlayer points. And now that the world is on fire and the soylana manlets are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for airdrops.

Good Morning. I just wanted to say how truly grateful I am for this group from the bottom of my heart.

The folks in here are caring, sincere, curious, and hungry for the truth. In this world we live in, it's really a rarity to have this quality of human concentrated in one place.

Yesterday  I got hacked through my own fault and signed off-chain approval for  2 assets that were drained from my wallet.  This was my first time being scammed/hacked.

Somehow, they also managed to pay down a significant portion of my USDC debt \[huzzah!\] from my AAVE position by withdrawing/paying out to get my ETH- so it did not end up being completely catastrophic. I still don't fully understand what happened with this piece of the puzzle.

No less than 8-10 people reached out, offered help, pointed me in the right direction, and that means the world to me. I know I'm not getting the tokens back.

Last night I wrapped my head around what happened and tossed back a bunch of beers with friends in real life--nothing like joking about it to get over it mentally.

Just wanted to say thanks again to everyone in here that makes this such an amazing community.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19ac5xh/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2024/kiltktx/)

I'm here with a new Rocket Pool update!

A few weeks ago, I mentioned the process for new tokenomics had started. We were looking for (and still are, I guess) submissions, and [we got over 20](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/call-for-reviewers-rapid-research-incubation/2631)! These range from changing collateral systems, new RPL rewards dynamics, MEV theft protections, and much more.

A new committee to analyze the submissions has been created with [5 members](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubation-begins/2654). You're welcome to follow along (and provide feedback on the submissions if you are interested). There are three community members and two team members. They will inspect every submission, rank them, and make suggestions. This process is expected to take place over the next few weeks.

Next, it is likely the new tokenomics will be a blend of the outstanding submissions. We already have one community member [share ideas](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/main/2023_11_rapid_research_incubator/overall_preference.md) on what they think the new tokenomics for Rocket Pool might look like. This is all still very early, though, and there are going to be many changes and suggestions in the coming weeks.

This whole process has been hugely exciting (for tokenomics nerds like me haha). I'll let you all know what the outstanding submissions were once we get some clarity on that and what direction the next steps will take.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll discusses the ethics of airdrop farming, u/superphiz and many other provide great responses</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19b4wii/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2024/kipwmck/)

[u/Tricky_Troll](https://reddit.com/u/Tricky_Troll):

I‚Äôm curious as to people‚Äôs thoughts on the ethics of airdrop farming after a discussion I had deep in replies yesterday.

Firstly, I have two airdrop farming wallets. I try to stick to projects I like and not get too degenerate. This helps it feel legitimate to me as the original airdrop idea was to give shares and a stake in the platform out to the community. But two wallets? A true sybil resistant system would call me out for that and either penalise me or only reward me once. Is having two wallets being greedy? Maybe. Personally it feels like a rational balance between the following:

- Fighting airdrop farmers with dozens or hundreds of wallets who might be diluting my share.

- Not blatantly farming/sybil attacking the drop mechanism.

- Not spending too much mental and financial overhead speculating on something which may not happen.

On the other hand, to me, the idea of having a dozen wallets or more to farm an airdrop feels wrong. The developers will set a certain amount tokens to the community and if you game their mechanisms and qualify on 10 wallets, then you get 10 slices of the pie instead of 1. This adds 9 more slices to the pie than an anti-sybil minded developer would have ideally intended. Since this has no effect on the total number of tokens in the airdrop, your sybil wallets have eaten into the size of the slices of everyone else. In short, airdrop distributions are a zero sum game and more tokens for you means less for someone else.

Now I'm not trying to virtue signal or shame anyone for having 10 wallets. There's no ethical code about how much free money someone is entitled to. Furthermore, there is a justifiable and rational argument that since others are sybil attacking, you need to too. After all, you‚Äôre not eating into the average Joe‚Äôs piece of the pie, you‚Äôre eating into the faceless big airdrop farm in China with 1,000 wallets run by a computer program. At the end of the day, it is the developer‚Äôs job to ensure that the distribution is sybil resistant and makes it to the community and not the spammers.

This is in the same vein of human coordination problems we face with MEV ‚Äî an arms race appears to capture economic value as no amount of virtue signalling and solo stalkers opting to build their own blocks will be enough coordination to stop rational actors from doing what makes the most economic sense. In fact, being virtuous just leaves more profit for the ‚Äúbad‚Äù and less values driven actors. So with that said, does that make being virtuous and leaving more value on the table actively counter productive for our values? In the bigger picture, this is why we need things like proposer-builder separation. To remove as many of these mechanisms of value capture which involve some kind of arms race. This is because in these areas of competitive value capture, there is almost always a centralising force over time towards those who are the most successful and in some cases, the most brutal with their tactics (see block proposal timing games for the latest development here).

To get back on the original topic, why two wallets? I guess it's just the way I was raised to not be too greedy or selfish in a zero sum game. As I said above, I‚Äôd be taking more from someone else‚Äôs slice. But on the other hand, I‚Äôm not lost in an idealistic world. The rational side of my brain sees how the game theory plays out and says farm that airdrop and take a slice out of the big boys‚Äô pie as they‚Äôd only spend the money on stupid things anyway. So here I am, somewhere in the middle. I‚Äôm definitely putting effort into farming airdrops and with 2 wallets, maybe taking a larger slice than I‚Äôm fairly entitled to. However, it is still less than I could get if I really wanted more.

All this is probably a similar reason to why I just want a house in the countryside somewhere and not a gazillion rental properties, a ferrari and a yacht. I would get very marginal enjoyment out of such fancy things and that marginal enjoyment nowhere near equates to the amount of good for others which those millions of dollars could do if they were put to more productive work. After all, spending money tells society where to put its effort. Collectively we get much more from feeding and housing people than we do from vroom vroom shiny car go fast. But still, even 90% of the world aren‚Äôt lucky enough to own their own home and live in a safe, stable, country. So at this rate I‚Äôll likely be getting a bigger slice than I‚Äôd be fairly entitled to if the world‚Äôs resources were split evenly. But in the situation I have been fortunate enough to find myself in, I don‚Äôt feel overly greedy and I hope that‚Äôs good enough.

Anyway, thanks for reading me share my thought process. I learned a bit just trying to articulate this. So let me know, where do you lie on the scale of [u/Superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz) to hyper-capitalist rational actor? Or what are your thoughts on any of the above. In the end this discussion covered way more than I thought it would.

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

No flowery preamble because my wife is demanding that I get in the shower for a day trip. I do adore you in so many ways tricky, and I'm honored that you consider my positions and our alignment. Here are too many bullet points that will definitely make me late for the shower.

1. I don't want anyone to exaggerate my wholesomeness and assume that I am too "good" to airdrop farm or use multiple accounts. I definitely have and will continue to use multiple accounts if it appears that those mundane actions will increase my qualifications for an airdrop.

2. In general, I see airdrops differently than other people. I don't typically view airdrops as a benefit to the end recipient, but as a combination of a VC liquidity tool, or an engagement farming technique that allows startups to more easily create a case to VC for additional funding or valuation. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're probably not abusing the airdrop, but in most cases I think the airdrop is taking advantage of you by farming you. They're trying to pump key metrics through farming user activities, this lets them prove to VC that their platform really is worth funding.

3. My recent pushback against points is along this vein - if you're farming away for imaginary points but startups are using your metrics as proof of success to VC, then there's a good chance you're just straight up being abused. Do you know what VC likes even MORE than users who exert little outflow on a startup? FREE users. If a startup can generate a ton of activity for ZERO cost AND have a rabid user base, they're going to win big. I really adore big winners, but I want those winners to be good products, not just good incentive farmers.

4. I'm really just encouraging people to take their own farming to the next level by engaging intelligently with projects that they like rather than being mindless zombies jumping through hoops. I don't know why, or if it even makes sense, it's just where I'm at right now.

5. I feel like EVERYONE thinks I'm targeting eigenlayer, and I'm not. I have hesitancy about Eigenlayer because of its impact on the security layer, and I accept it as a natural evolution of our space. I have no intention or desire to target them for their airdrop mechanism, other than to say, farming for points can be risky and create a house of cards in certain cases.

6. Regarding the greed issue (ferraris and yachts), I definitely align with you - I want to carve out a fair share and leave enough pie for others, but that doesn't mean I'm some kind of altruistic monk. I DO enjoy the benefits of wealth and I do hope to continue building wealth, but it's true that I take a more socialistic approach than many others. I feel like if we build Ethereum to be super powerful and valuable, then we will also benefit from that value; but if all of us focus on greed and extraction now, everyone will suffer in the long run. I prefer to think of cryptocurrency as a nascent project that has 1000x growth potential (platform, not price) if we foster healthy growth, or it can have a quick death if everyone extracts without regenerating.

7. Finally, I want to remind everyone that value and wealth are represented by more than money. Money is fun, but money is only useful when it's used in an environment where it can bring you benefit. As a worst case scenario, money was useless in the stone age because it couldn't bring benefit. I have a real belief that if we bring blockchain developments to fruition, then the entire world will have access to more benefit. NFTs are a horrible (but useful) example of this. Prior to blockchains, you could have billions of dollars, but still no access to NFTs. Money could not provide that benefit because blockchains hadn't been developed to the extent that they were possible. There are MANY other developments that will be possible in the future if we continue developing this technology, and when we do, our money will be even more useful than it is today because we'll have access to more value from it through blockchain developments.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency explains what would happen if the Nethermind bug happened to Geth</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19bwkm1/daily_general_discussion_january_21_2024/kiyi5lo/)

Assumptions:

* You are running a single validator
* A bug causes one client to fork (like we saw today with nethermind)
* Geth is a supermajority client (>66%), nethermind is a minority client (<33%), as is currently the case
* No bailout (just for illustration purposes)

If a Nethermind fork happens (this is what actually happened today):

* Geth stakers continue with no losses
* Nethermind stakers lose an amount of ETH equal to 2x how long it takes for them to get back online (if you're offline for 3 hours, you lose 6 hours of rewards - that's 3 hours of attestation penalties or "negative rewards", plus that same 3 hours of opportunity cost where you weren't earning the usual rewards)

If a Geth fork happens (exactly like what happened today, but just swap geth and nethermind):

* Nethermind stakers continue with no losses
* Geth stakers finalize a bugged fork and get "stuck". The canonical chain stops finalizing. Inactivity leak for geth stakers starts slow at first, then accelerates. Extrapolating from /u/hanniabu's [twitter post](https://twitter.com/hanni_abu/status/1743361243790922069), you lose 28 ETH of your 32 ETH.

**TL;DR:** Stake with nethermind, a nethermind bug causes you to lose 0.0005 ETH. Stake with geth, a geth bug causes you to lose 28 ETH.

Disclaimer, this is all to the best of my knowledge and I don't consider myself to be an expert in this.

<summary>u/interweaver reminds us how important it is that Ethereum succeeds and how we can protect it as best as possible</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19bwkm1/daily_general_discussion_january_21_2024/kiyfnvq/)

Perfection is an illusion.

No software is perfect.

When a system is built on a software monoculture, it *will* inevitably fail when that critical software inevitably fails.

When a system is built on a diverse polyculture of software, it becomes resilient enough to not fail overall when any particular piece of supporting software fails.

Ethereum is too important to fail. It's too important to the future of money and the internet, too important in the fight against Moloch, and too important to the inhabitants of a world that is becoming more and more centralized as time goes on.

If I were on the side of Moloch, if I were going to attack Ethereum, I would do exactly what a sophisticated attacker might indeed be doing: releasing blocks designed to give minority clients issues, in the hope that people would be scared back onto Geth, in hopes of shutting down the nascent polyculture that its proponents have been desperately trying to cultivate before it's too late. 

I would tell people that it's much more important to avoid the possibility of a few hours of downtime once or twice a year than it is to avoid the permanent destruction of the chain's Lindy and legitimacy.

You all *know* Ethereum is too important to fail. Of those of you running nodes or especially staking, most have done the responsible thing and run minority clients. 

Don't let anyone scare you into switching back into the supermajority. Don't let the occasional minor hiccups distract you from the looming impact of the supermajority bug asteroid that we're desperately trying to divert from its path towards planet Ethereum before it's too late. 

Embrace the fact that no software is perfect, and that helping run Ethereum will *always* mean the possibility of unexpected adventures, no matter what software you run. But it's your choice whether those adventures will be a fun afternoon resyncing your execution client in the good company of your fellow client users, or a less fun loss of every single Ether you staked, while the community fractures around you and all of our dreams for a better, more decentralized future lie in tatters around us. 

Choose wisely.

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

Here is a list of some node operators with a lot of ETH staked using Geth. The easiest way to fix the EL client diversity issue is to knock on their doors and let them know why it matters. If you are staking with them, be aware that your stake is at risk if a bug in Geth would cause a mass slashing. You should unstake with them and let them know why you are doing so.

I have added client teams staking with Lido in there because I find it particularly problematic that they do not lead the charge of client diversity with their example. Them more than anyone should be aware of the risks.

Operator | Total ETH Staked | Estimated Geth usage
---|---|----
Coinbase | 4400000| 100%
Kraken | 860000 | 100%
Binance | 1000000 | 100%
Nethermind | 10000 | 68%
Prysmatic Labs | 10000 | 100%
Consensys | 10000 | 100%
Sigma Prime | 10000 | 70%
Kiln (Lido) | 10000 | 100%
Kiln (non-Lido) | 790000 | 100%?
Allnodes | 700000 | 100%
Bitcoin Suisse | 550000 | 100%
Stakefish | 370000 | 100%

These guys together represent 1/3 of all ETH staked. If the do something about it the problem is gone.

and then to:

You can donate Eth and get an NFT.

Alternatively Go fund me or directly through justicedao.

The precedent set in that legal case might have a significant impact on the future of ethereum. 

I dont see any Monero/Zcash donations so far. But maybe that wouldnt be in their best interest anyway.

<summary>u/Ender985 writes a post mortem on the recent nethermind incident</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19dhkux/daily_general_discussion_january_23_2024/kj6bxbc/)

I wanted to write a small post-mortem on the Nethermind incident, as a small solo staker.

Nethermind started having problems around block 19056922. Block sync became more infrequent than usual, there were some missed attestations, but the node somehow kept up. Finally, 1h and 50 minutes later, Nethermind started reporting "No incoming messages from the consensus client that is required for sync" and Prysm "Execution client is not syncinc", effectively putting the node offline (let's call this T+0).

I became aware of the issue at about T+45min. Tried restarting the services at T+50min, but quickly found out that this did not resolve the issue. After that, I checked if Eth prices had crashed to see if the whole blockchain had been attacked and brought down, but saw no price action. Then I went on discord, and found out that this was a Nethermind-specific issue.

After reading that a full resync might solve the issue, I rebooted Nethermind into a fresh data dir at T+1h20min, to begin the process. I was shocked to find that at T+2h23min the node was already submitting attestations, only 1h and 3 minutes after starting the sync from scratch. The first time I did this a number of months ago, it took more than 10 hours to get to this point. The node was not fully operational yet (I think block proposals would still have failed), but at least I was back attesting the network.

At around this time the Nethermind team announced that a fix was released (at T+1h40min apparently), but it took a while for the ubuntu repo to propagate the last version. My node was already attesting, so I was in no rush to update. About 1h later, I applied the fix, reverted back to the old database, and the node was fully online again.

In total, the attestation downtime made each validator earn 0.0007 eth less that it would have in normal operating conditions. This comes up to $1.57 per validator at today's prices, quite literally pocket change. Of course a missed block would have meant a much larger missed cost, but the chances of getting a block within the downtime window were quite low.

All in all, the issue was identified and fixed by the Nethermind devs incredibly quickly for a Sunday evening, and only caused a few hours of downtime. If anything, the speed of the fix only gave me more confidence on the Nethermind team, now that I've seen them working under fire. True, if I had been running geth I would have avoided this incident, but if I'd been running geth and there was a similar incident with that client I'd probably have lost most of my eth.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19ea76a/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2024/kjbkocf/)

A few weeks ago a wrote a blog post about my experience with the various execution and consensus clients as a solo staker and the small differences they have. I never shared it here. It grew out of a longer message I wrote on the gnosis chain discord and it was well received there. It is a personal view so I am definitely missing a few angles, but hopefully there is no wrong information in there. If you think something could/should be improved, please let me know. I wrote it shortly before the Besu bug, so nothing about the recent bugs is discussed. I am still debating if I should add a short section about the bugs, but at the moment I leave it like that.

<summary>u/accidental_green releases an automated tool that makes switching clients a breeze</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/19ea76a/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2024/kjdd7zb/)

In pursuit of client diversity, I simplified the open source [client-switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher) and removed any code that wasn't absolutely necessary.

It's now a basic Python script of 439 lines that does the following:

**1) Prompt user for inputs and validate inputs:**  

- Select Ethereum network (mainnet, goerli, sepolia, holesky)  
- Select Execution Client to REMOVE (geth, besu, nethermind, none)  
- Select Execution Client to INSTALL (geth, besu, nethermind, none)

**2) Remove old client and install new client**  
**3) Create new service files, reload daemon, print final results**

That's it! Same process as Somer's guides just simplified and automated. The switch takes 5 minutes with validators attesting again in \~2 hours (nethermind).

There's a CLI (terminal) and GUI version to fit various setups and preferences.

It's all open source, so you can check [github](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher) or [ethstaker](https://reddit.com/user/accidental_green/comments/19ekqqh/simple_client_switcher/) to view detailed images and review the code.

I'm working to get it audited asap, but any help in the meantime is appreciated.

<summary>u/accidental_green developed an awesome tool to encourage client diversity. With more indepth Here!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/193ukvu/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2024/khc7q53/)

In the spirit of client diversity, I created an open source tool that allows anyone to instantly swap to a minority client with 0 configuration or effort. Just 1 click, new client.

I added a simple GUI, so switching clients can now be done with 0 programming experience in under 30 seconds.

Installation is based on Somer Esat's guides and works with Geth, Besu, and Nethermind on both mainnet and testnets.

Feel free to check out the [ethstaker post](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/193wwen/ethereum_client_switcher_switch_from_geth_in_30/) or see the details on Github:

- [Client Switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher): Instantly switch Execution Client  
- [Validator Install](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install): Fresh Ubuntu to full validator in minutes  
- [Validator Updater](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-update): Update Execution and Consensus client to latest versions

These are personal projects that have not been audited, but the code is open source and fairly easy to understand. Any testing or feedback is always appreciated!

I created an open source validator updater that allows home stakers to update their entire setup in a single click with almost no downtime!

**Github repo**: [https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater)

**Validator Updater Summary:**

1. Select Execution Client to update: (Besu, Geth, Nethermind)
2. Select Consensus Client to update: (Lighthouse, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku)
3. Select Update MEV-boost: (Yes or No)
4. Click "Update" to close the window and return to the terminal

Once complete, restart the services and ensure the validator is still attesting.

The updated binaries are installed at /usr/local/bin to be compatible with Somer Esat's guides, but can be adapted to work with non-standard installations.

Feel free to review my other validator related repos below:

[Validator Install](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install)**:** Fresh Ubuntu to syncing validator in 1 minute  
[Validator Controller](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-controller)**:** Validator GUI for easy operation (start, stop, journals, etc)  
[Client Switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher)**:** Instantly switch between Execution Clients

The code has not been audited, so use with caution. These are all open source community resources, so testing and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Cheers and Happy Staking!

<summary>u/Syentist makes a case for raising the gas limit while u/thewalkinglive and u/16withScars share developer sentiment that we should be more cautious</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/193ukvu/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2024/khcoevx/)

[u/Syentist](https://reddit.com/u/Syentist):

Going to bring this up again: I strongly think we need to increase the gas limit, and Dencun is probably the best time to co-ordinate around this (although a HF is not needed for validators to increase the gas limit). 

A few things to point out again:

1. The last gas limit increase was early 2021, almost 3 years ago. Cost of SSDs have substantially reduced since then
2. Most L1 native apps (Maker vaults, ENS, LSTs) have not completed migration to L2s. Partly because we still don't have a Stage 2 L2 anyways. Which means users are still forced to use the L1, and pay high fees for basic and essential functions like taking a DAI loan or staking ETH for stETH.
3. We are clearly on the cusp of mainstream attention, especially as an ETH ETFapproval nears in May. Which means we are going to run into exceptionally high gas fees under current settings, and a constant narrative that the "Ethereum chain is unusable". An entire cohort of new users (probably the largest wave of new on-boarded users to date) will see the ridiculous fees on L1 (and by extension, L2s), see the sub-cent fees on Solana, and simply gravitate to the cheaper narrative. We will unnecessarily lose out on the narrative war, and the Nov-Dec period of scorn to the ethereum community is, I fear, just a prelude. 
4. Most importantly: Vitalik has soft-signalled this twice in the past week. First, in the tweet thread on the roadmap update (when he pointed out gas limit increase doesn't need a HF and can be done anytime), and secondly and more explicitly, in yesterday's EF AMA. Now, the problems with increasing the gas limit: State growth, client stability, cost of minimal equipment - \*of-fucking-course these variables are playing out in Vitalik's head\*, he has written more on this than pretty much anyone alive. Of course he is aware of it, no? But pragmatic choices need to be made, and that is what I see here in his comments. 
5. Finally, I think it is time the ethereum community and core protocol development process "formalised" a framework for minimum validator specs per fixed cost of fiat. It can't be based on just vibes. It can't be that we want to - eventually - run a full validator on the computing power of a microwave (running lightclients is a differnet story). We need a reasonable threshold - something like a full validator should not cos more than $800 to assemble. And every 12 months or so, we review the hardware prices, and if it costs cheaper than $800 (or X threshold) to run a validator, we raise the gas limit (or number of blobs or whatever else).

On increasing the gas limit, I agree with [Francesco](https://twitter.com/fradamt/status/1745409249562206531) and [Dankrad](https://twitter.com/dankrad/status/1745406611202437356) (researchers at EF). 

My take is similar:

Bumping the gas limit just as EIP-4844 is about to be shipped which already increases storage and network bandwidth costs is a bad idea

this isn't the right time at all

given the better hardware argument, we should definitely be increasing the size of blobspace (not blockspace). But only after the Deneb HF.

<summary>u/benido2030 thinks we should organize around a community $STRK delegate. And then updates the search for an EthFinance/EVMavericks $STRK delegate</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/194nvno/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2024/khhnuxp/)

The result from the OP RPGF round 3 is a big motivation for me because it shows me that if we coordinate as a community, we can really get things done and improve the ecosystem.

I believe $STRK is around the corner. The snapshot for the airdrop is in according to an official tweet beginning of December 2023. The last upgrade allows tx to be paid in $STRK (but you obviously still use ETH as well). And afaik $STRK that lived on L1 for a long time now also is briged/ deployed on starknet.

I am also rather sure that $STRK will be a governance token because it is a governance token now and there are delegates participating in governance already, see this [vote/ example](https://governance.starknet.io/voting-proposals/0x8cf15c543775031ca8a8960747c00b501d0a6e4baef8ca8518701f73f98d61cb).

So here are some questions:

(1) Who has used Starknet a lot and knows the ecosystem? (whatever that means, hard to answer tbh)

(2) Who has the time, energy and willingness to act as a delegate for starknet?

I think it would be great if we could informally agree on 1, 2, 3, x delegates that could represent this community in the starknet ecosystem and governance. That obviously doesn't mean that you can't delegate your $STRK to someone else outside of this community! But if we agree on candidates beforehand, those potential delegates can setup everything when the token drops.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1971kkf/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2024/khy6tvo/)

So a quick update on the [$STRK delegate search](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/194nvno/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2024/khhnuxp/?context=3) I started on Friday:

We have a first candidate: u/Tricky_Troll is interested and I would probably borrow $STRK to delegate even more to him! (I won't, but I think Tricky is a great first candidate!)

But let's *not* stop here, I think we should have 2 or maybe even 3 candidates. First of all it would be great if we as a community had a choice from ETH Finance (and let me get that straight: not because I think Tricky is not a great candidate, as I said I would delegate to Tricky without thinking twice!). More importantly though, I think we will likely - as a community - have a lot of $STRK power that we probably should spread across at least 2 delegates. So I would be really happy to see more people coming forward! 

Also u/bob-rossi said that he would be happy to share his experience with people thinking about being a delegate. So if you wanna understand what it is like before you make a decision, feel free to contact him. Maybe a channel in the EVM discord like he suggested also makes sense and maybe other delegates would have a look as well, to share their thoughts. In a best case scenario "our" delegates not only receive voting power from Eth Finance, but maybe the more experienced delegates can tell us how they convinced people to delegate to them! 

So: I would be very excited if some people thought about being a delegate and of course best case share their interest here so we can coordinate. 

Let's go!

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi will be running for an Arbitrum Grants council spot</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/194nvno/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2024/khijzq9/)

Discussions on the next version of the Arbitrum grants program have been underway and I wanted to share this for two reasons. 

1) It is currently in the Snapshot voting stage. So, if anyone here is involved with projects that are interested in that type of thing it might be a good idea to start coordinating what an application would look like. I don't believe they have any official application template just yet, but I'd imagine it will be pretty similar to the STIP rounds. This new round already has some changes that should hopefully make it less chaotic then the first STIP grants. 

2) One of the changes is creating a 5-member council that gives a first pass at all applicants. The goal here is to cut down on some of applicant volume so when delegates vote they can be less overwhelmed and have the ability to review the proposals a little more thoroughly. And then they are adding 3 "Applicant Advisor" roles as well. That group can help assist projects with polishing their application for a best chance of success. I wanted to mention that specifically for any projects that may apply, that the assistance is there. Both are an elected and paid position.

Relating to point two... part of my post is to let everyone here know I will be running for one of the council spots. I'm not sure how successful I will be honestly, but I wanted to at least make people here aware since I'm sure many of my delegates come from here. I actually applied a week+ ago, but wanted to wait until voting was closer to 'announce'.

I'm trying really hard to toe the line between being the overbearing "hey vote for me" guy while still being effective at least getting the word out. So I'll leave it simply at this - if there are any questions you have for me relating to my application, or even just any thoughts on what a successful council would look like if I got elected, please let me know. And of course, if you do decide to support me always know I will be grateful! 

I really, really wish I could link the post... but probably easiest to find more info about the grant program would be going to the [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a) and clicking the corresponding link to the main Arbitrum governance forum. Then if you are interested in who is running for council, the 17th post in that thread will have a link directly to the "**LTI Pilot Program Position Application Thread".** Which alternatively can be found by going to the main forum page, clicking under the blue "Dao Grants Program" subsection, and finding that thread near the top. Sorry for the runaround, but Reddit does really make it this much of a pain...

<summary>u/Ethical-trade discusses the future of France Finance</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1971kkf/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2024/khyb3rv/)

By now I'm sure we've all seen Larry Fink, CEO of the world's largest asset manager Blackrock (with $9 trillion in assets, 3 times France's entire GDP), saying that the future of france is tokenization of assets "**on one single ledger**" ([source](https://twitter.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1746243017508614392)). More specifically, he talked about bonds and stocks.

But what could this "one single ledger" be?

In [this other interview](https://twitter.com/Cryptik1E/status/1745776244745289934), Fink again mentions stepping stones towards tokenization **right after speaking about an ether ETF**.

Since that I've read a few Ethereum detractors saying that there's no way tokenization of stocks and bonds will happen on mainnet Ethereum, because issuers will need an environment they can control. And this is probably sort of right.

But what they'll also need is an environment that fully communicates with the leading tokenization platform. 

[Ethereum currently holds 55% of all of defi's TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), here's your leading platform. That's the "one single ledger" Fink talks about. And that's without counting rollups and sidechains. And before a 10x scaling of rollups in a couple of months.

But interoperability and control, how to you reconciliate these two? 

In the past banks have created their own permissioned Ethereum clones (Hyperledger, Quorum, ... more about these [here](https://ethereum.org/en/enterprise/private-ethereum)). They looked like intranet, closed and safe versions of the internet. But have you heard of projects that crossed the chasm and made it to mainnet? I haven't. Just like intranet, these projects were fun playground but didn't take advantage of the full potential of Ethereum. What good is a website others can't reach?

Today, the scaling solution(s) chosen by the Ethereum community happen to be absolutely perfect for reconciliating interoperability with control. A rollup, a volition, a validium or any other hybrid solution is just what's needed to solve this problem. 

You can be part of the ecosystem, but still retain some degree of control. 

Not only that but the cost will soon basically be net zero: we can safely expect that launching your own L2 on Ethereum will be as trivial as launching a smart contract: copy some open source code and let stakers manage security for you through Eigenlayer. How much did Hyperledger and Quorum cost to create and operate? I couldn't find figures but a shitload I'm sure. How much will launching a rollup cost in 2 years? 1,000 or 10,000 less?

I don't like Fink and probably never will. But it truly amazes me how far we've come.

Today, the CEO of the world's largest asset managers sees the future we've seen for years, a future of finance with Ethereum at its core.

I wanted to repost it because I really dont think it got the recognition it deserved. You know those "steps" Larry Fink talked about which eventually culminate in full tokenisation of everything. *This is the next big step* 

And as I said I believe this usecase alone, if eventually succesful at scale (such that it picks up a network effect) could swell Ethereum to unfathomable degrees. I truly think this is being slept on by us crypto natives.

[u/JebediahKholin](https://reddit.com/u/JebediahKholin):

I often find myself thinking that eth is a natural solution to a lot of global financial problems. The latest is the fink tokenized asset commentary.

Another was the issue of central banks not having a fast trustless way to trade currencies. To an eth enthusiast, this is an obvious fit - issue currencies as erc20s, and let the trading simply occur in a trustless format.

The imf didn‚Äôt even consider this, but instead addressed all kinds of cbdc variants. The obvious problem is that they‚Äôre all trusted, and countries simply don‚Äôt trust each other enough to use one another‚Äôs private chains. The imf briefly addressed bitcoin as a possibility before dismissing it.

I wonder if a lot of this reflexive hostility to eth and permissionless programmable chains is a response to bitcoin and its dominant narrative. Bitcoiners talk about fiat being worthless and central banks as enemies - of course central banks are going to view this with hostility. They view an attack on their fiat as an attack on their sovereignty. The digital gold/SoV approach makes much more sense for how bitcoin is set up, but also is less of a direct challenge.

Anyway, all this to say that closed eth clones are always going to have the problem of being trusted, and if you‚Äôre not part of the consortium running the chain, you‚Äôre ultimately at their mercy. Now matter how big that consortium is, there will always be some outside it, thereby limiting its network effects.

Security alert!

Bungee / socket being exploited.

Revoke contract 0x3a23f943181408eac424116af7b7790c94cb97a5

source Spreek

<https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1747337879771033632>

Edit: Only mainnet exploited, other chains could be exploitable. Same contract on other chains, 0xaDdE7028e7ec226777e5dea5D53F6457C21ec7D6 on zksync era.

Edit2: Afaik if you used bungee you should be fine, as their webapp does only approve the amount you like to send.

Edit3: <https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech/status/1747349422730813525> Socket confirmed and paused the contract.

Edit4: Hopefully last edit. Revoke cash has created a tool to easily check. Although contracts are paused, it's recommended to revoke if your address is affected. It could also happen that you bridged with services like zerion or rainbow. [<https://revoke.cash/exploits/socket?chainId=1>

Fast reaction from Bungee.

This sent me on a revoke binge regardless. It's easy to get sloppy for the sake of convenience. The other day I mentioned using Odos rather than other aggregators so I limit my approvals. Of course, this requires actually revoking previous approvals!

I like the idea of a 2 addresses setup, to limit risk. Address A holds all funds. Only ever sends and receives tokens to address B. Address B is the trader. Approves everything, does the swaps, gets into the tokenized positions, transfers everything back to A once each series of operations is done. This protects against many hacks since A holds everything and approves nothing.

However... It's hard to have the discipline to stick to this. It would be fantastic if there was wallet software to automate this behavior. You "start a session" and this triggers A sending whatever to B, then you operate B as a normal wallet, then as you "close your session" this triggers a transaction of B sending whatever newly acquired funds back to A. Even restricting any action from A that's not send to B (unless you enter a password to override, or whatever).

Probably hard to build but man I would love this.

<summary>u/interweaver discovered and reported a bug in their execution client!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/198pjar/daily_general_discussion_january_17_2024/kidbw3k/)

Guess what, I had a [u/seamonkey82](https://reddit.com/u/seamonkey82) moment today, and helped find a client bug! Story time :D

Some of you may be aware that there's an ongoing debate about whether Ethereum can handle a slight increase in its block gas limit. This would make L1 gas slightly cheaper by creating more blockspace, at the expense of being harder to keep in sync with the chain for the weakest machines on the network. 

The gas limit is currently at 30M units of gas per block (which means 15M units is equilibrium). Some folks are proposing raising it 33%-50%, to e.g. 40M-45M, while others oppose any raises, especially in light of the upcoming EIP-4844, which will raise requirements a bit too.

The fun thing is, individual stakers actually are able to change this number themselves whenever they propose blocks. Unlike many other changes, you don't need a hardfork to accomplish it. Rather, individual stakers can pick their own "target gas limit", which their client will attempt to move the gas limit towards. The protocol allows the block gas limit to change by 1/1024th of the previous block's value, per block. In this way, if the majority of the stake decides on a new number, the value will start random walking its way to that new value, and stick there more firmly the greater the consensus. This mechanism is a holdover from the days of mining, but it's pretty neat.

Anyway, as a solo staker, I decided to YOLO raise my own limit last month, and set it up to 40M. This involves setting some flags in your execution and consensus clients. I run Besu/Lodestar, and set their flags appropriately.

Since then, I proposed (at least) one MEV-boost block. As expected, that block's gas limit was 30M + 30M / 1024, i.e. 30029295 units. A slightly less than 0.1% increase over the standard amount. It isn't much, but it helped make Ethereum L1 slightly cheaper for that block and (indirectly) the next few! Cool, everything's working!

Since *then*, I proposed (at least) one locally-built block (I have a min-bid set, like most responsible solo stakers who care about avoiding too much censorship, and it triggered.) As a reminder, locally built blocks are constructed by your execution client, in my case Besu, from the contents of their public mempools.

My locally built block(s), upon examination, looked great, except for one thing! Rather than 30029295 units of gas as expected, and rather than the 30M units of gas I would expect to see if I had misconfigured something, my locally built block(s) had a gas limit of 30001024. WTF? It's supposed to change by 1/1024 of the parent block, not by 1024!

Some in-depth adventures into the Besu Github later, I confirmed that indeed, there was a bug that was causing all Besu locally built blocks to only be able to shift up or downwards by a maximum of 1024 units of gas, rather than the (at present) 29295 units of gas expected. Put another way, Besu stakers with locally built blocks would only be able to move the gas limit about 3% as fast as locally-building stakers running other execution clients.

Jumping into the Besu Discord, I reported this situation, and worked through it with Matt Nelson, one of the excellent Besu team members who can be found there. He confirmed the bug and figured out the needed fix, and that should be making it into a future Besu version.

So anyway, moral of the story is, just YOLO changing numbers is apparently a great way to find client bugs, with your face :P Hopefully as the gas limit discussion continues, this means Besu stakers will be fully equipped if there is more of a mass movement in the direction of increasing that limit!

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

I am glued to this Coinbase case today. You couldn't have asked for a friendlier judge. The judge was practically feeding arguments to Coinbase. Gensler should be screaming at the screen if he's watching this.

The only argument Coinbase made that bounced seemed to be the major questions doctrine where the judge is hesitant to remove the authority of anyone but Congress to regulate anything about this space.

However, the SEC has completely failed to define why a baseball card or fantasy football team wouldn't be a security but tokens would. The SEC wants any anon trade on Coinbase to be a security contract if someone promoted it on Twitter. Coinbase wants a security contract to include at minimum some type of contract or legal right. Unless the token includes *inherent* rights like on-chain governance and a claim to dividends it's hard to argue you are entering a contract when purchasing a token.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard covers how Eigen layer is affecting the peg of LSTs üß†</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18y5x53/daily_general_discussion_january_4_2024/kgctkg6/)

So many people hyped into the swETH EigenLayer contract that it has seriously affected the swETH peg. Prior to the EigenLayer deposit opening people were chain minting swETH for Pearls then selling it to ETH at almost a 3% loss. That is to say the market was speculating that the pearl to ETH ratio would be about .0015. As recently as Dec 10th swETH was at about 1.01 swETH/ETH. Right now it's sitting at almost 1.05 (the native rate is 1.0471). So just holding swETH in the past 4 weeks has made you 4% almost on your ETH (more than an entire year of solo staking). It has also [largely drained the swETH liquidity](https://dune.com/swell-network/sweth-in-dexes) as apparently LPs exited their position to pure swETH and deposited the whole stack into EigenLayer. You can see volume hugely spiked, right around the time TVL halved.

Larger LSTs are less dramatically affected but there's the same phenomenon are still visible in them. In many cases the lower liquidity has significantly improved the liquidity farming rates. Some of these new combination pools like cbETH/wstETH/rETH are yielding over 12% APR (like 5x solo staking). Even most of the older pools are still at or above 7.5% after accounting for the native appreciation of the LST in their yield.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18y5x53/daily_general_discussion_january_4_2024/kgb7pvg/)

* Eigen Layer smart contract risk: Initially slashing will be manually vetted (not sure about penalties), but eventually this will be an automated process. There's the potential to get penalized/slashed accidentally.
* Eigen Layer AVS (services) smart contract risk: - There's the potential to get penalized/slashed accidentally.
* Token risk: Some services may require you to hold their token as collateral in replace of or in addition to ETH.
* Consensus risk: 
   * You're assigning your withdrawal address to Eigen Layer. As their marketshare increases it's not great to have them in that position of power, especially when slashing is a manual process where there's coercion potential.
   * It alters the incentive mechanisms of the chain by introducing large scale second order incentives. Things that a logical actor wouldn't consider before may now be an option.
   * It encourages risk at the consensus layer, which isn't good. Especially since home stakers that are more risk averse may not want to participate since native APR gets pushed down and the only way to have sufficient APR is to engage in that risk.
* Influence: If Eigen Layer gets larger, they can have outweighed influence on the ecosystem similar to Lido. That influence allows unchecked growth and behavior because people don't want to be on your bad side. You can also afford pay your way to the outcomes you want.
* Unknown risk: Just like with MEV and builders, there can be a rabbit hole of issues we're not aware of yet.

Note: While Eigen Layer was specifically mentioned, I believe these are inherent risks to all restaking

suggest everyone interested in privacy preserving technology read this update (from early December) around Railgun V3. Railgun is a privacy layer you can deposit to and withdrawal to any address, and now they are going to help incorporate defi onto the privacy layer so all your swaps and farming can be shielded. 

Also Nocturne just launched a working product last month (which is I think maybe what spurned this update article, friendly competition), and it's nice to see privacy projects still building even if the USG is trying to chill everyone away from the space. Vitalik is a known backer of Nocturne as well.

[EDIT Nocturne Announcement Article]

lastly don't forget that Aztec network is supposed to launch sometime this year. we may have lost Tornado access in the US temporarily, but it didn't shut it down (not even close) and more and more of these privacy solutions will emerge making it even more and more difficult to deter. at the end of the day blockchain doesn't work without proper privacy being an option. I urge everyone to learn about and explore these tools.

<summary>u/masterRoshi9 discusses one of the original reasons we're drawn to crypto</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18zt205/daily_general_discussion_january_6_2024/kglzhbv/)

Please excuse this minor pause in bullishness and meme sentiment while I vent a bit and reflect on larger problems. 

I often think about how inefficient, backwards, corrupt, and self serving politicians of the world  governments are; particularly my own. Without getting specific and political, there are so many obvious problems  that politicians refuse to address, or can‚Äôt, due to clearly perverse incentives that drive them and make them worse over time. It‚Äôs one of the things that‚Äôs drawn me most to crypto. The guys at Bankless and others in crypto have stated many times that crypto is speed running the lessons learned from traditional finance. More importantly I think it‚Äôs speed running lessons around incentive alignment. When everything is financial, the incentive problems and consequences of system design become much more explicit and quantifiable than they are implied like many of the problems in meat space. Governance issues have been rampant in crypto, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but experimentation on a smaller scale creates lessons learned and informative feedback that could ideally be applied to broader government systems. 

Unfortunately I often times think that we‚Äôre too far gone, or late in this game of informed discovery to be able to actionable apply these learnings to larger legacy systems. I‚Äôm not even sure we‚Äôve discovered ways to solve a lot of the problems in crypto let alone the broader physical world. Internally crypto can feel fast moving and iterative at a blazing pace, but it also feels slow to me in aspects like these. I feel that if crypto came about 50 years earlier, we might have had a better shot at rethinking the way we govern as a society; that we‚Äôd have been able to take more preventative measures or seen problems coming much earlier as a result. 

If there is a hope here, I‚Äôm confident it will come from younger generations and the lessons they learn from this industry. Everything is driven by incentives, and game theory should be considered everywhere when governing. Here‚Äôs hoping the US and other governments nurture innovation in this space going forward. Despite the scams and problems we have here, it is still the breeding ground for the ideas and minds that have the chance to turn things around. It is for this reason, among many others, that choosing pro-crypto candidates is a much higher stakes battle than I think many people realize, even in our industry. It is one of the most important aspects of candidates I will consider voting for moving forward. Long live crypto. Long live Ethereum. Long live innovation. Long live experimentation.

<summary>u/timmerwb shares some thoughts on staking after the Besu incident</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/190lbbx/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2024/kgqcffb/)

A few further thoughts and opinions on the Besu failure yesterday. I think there is nuance in this situation that got overlooked. But before I begin, let's get some facts straight - and these are well known and not up for debate:

*1) No client should have a super majority.*

*2) The current, and wholly inappropriate situation with Geth is based on i) it's code maturity and empirical reliability; ii) a completely unacceptable level of laziness, wrecklessness and short-term greed by large staking entities. (Which is sadly ironic because at least one of those is tied very closely to the overarching security mechanism of PoS - another example of how we cannot simply "code in" all required incentives.)*

However, for some stakers, namely solo-stakers (and possibly other smaller, more responsible staking entites), the situation is much less clear. I think it's fair to say that Geth is indeed a much(?) supererior client to the competition. Should, therefore, a solo-staker take on a more philanthropic role by worrying more about network health by say, running Besu - a less mature client - than their own immediate needs? In terms of measurable risk *for them* (as far as we can calculate) running Besu would seem to be a disadvantage. E.g. the probability of an event like yesterday for Besu (or NM?) is clearly higher, and their ability to recover from it expediently compared to a larger provider, probably much lower (hence larger losses in time, stress and income). Moreover, as stated at the outset, the systemic risk from the Geth super majority is *not* driven by solo stakers, and so solo stakers are not meaningfully mitigating that risk by avoiding Geth. (This is like the problem with global warming - we should all try our best, but in reality at this stage, due to the tragedy of the commons, the biggest, and possibly *only meaingful* improvements can be made by societal policy shift in law).

So, solo-stakers in particular have a question to answer. Should they willingly chose a client that is measureably poorer and riskier *for them*, basically in support of the "greater good"? Or do they stick with Geth, which is likely to be more reliable for them, and basically push the job of reducing the Geth majority onto the larger stakers (who are clearly much more culpable)? Ultimately, this is something of a subjective choice that boils down to estimates of risk, reliability and person attitude. Yes, Geth *could* fail in a catastrophic way, but Besu *did* fail in a catastrophic way. The (empirical) probabilities speak for themselves. Sadly, there is even a worse outcome here, in that (the short sighted) large stakers will now be extremely glad they were running Geth, and not Besu, because imagine having thouands of validators going down on a weekend, with no clear fix for ~24 hours. That would have been extremely costly. Bullet dodged.

In summary, if all clients were demonstrably equally reliabile, the choice of client and question of majority would be more straightforward. But they are not equal at the present time and pragmatism will prevail.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency share some wallet security tips</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/193195q/daily_general_discussion_january_10_2024/kha9kp1/)

As we enter the early stages of the next bull market, please remember to keep your crypto wallet secure. While I can't get into the specific schemes I use to keep mine secure, here are some general guidelines I follow that have worked for me since I created my first crypto wallet in the early 2010s.

* Always prefer open-source over closed-source. Never trust closed-source software with your main stack. Only use the most popular, well-vetted open source software.

* Strike a balance between safety and recoverability (make your keys safe enough that they don't get stolen, but not so "safe" they you lose the only copy of them).

* Have no single point of failure, wherever possible. Split your assets across addresses. Split your key across physical locations. But it's gotta be more sophisticated than just putting 12 words in one place and 12 words in another, because afaik 12 words can be bruteforced. Wish I could be more specific about this. Some wallets support Shamir, which can be a good way to do this. Gnosis Safe is less flexible but perhaps the only smart contract out there to be trusted with someone's main stack.

* Do not use the same PC user account for crypto that you use for your daily tasks. Ideally, have a crypto-only "online" computer that runs something other than Windows. Maintain a minimal software footprint on it. Log into it periodically to keep the OS up to date.

* Also keep a crypto-only "offline" computing device that never touches the internet. If it's a PC, it needs to be running a very mainstream very publicly-audited version of Linux like ubuntu, fedora, debian, etc. A hardware wallet counts as long as the design is open and the firmware is open-source, but it has some trade-offs you'll have to weigh for yourself.

* Do everything (concerning your main stack) in multiple batches. Everything. Even the most simple transfers from one address to another that seem like they would be impossible to fuck up, because trust me it's possible to fuck up - if not by your own accord, then by some tricky dicky scheme whereby a hacker replaces addresses in your computer's memory or uses some other silly scheme to bamboozle you. It'll be more expensive to batch things as far as transaction fees, but it's not possible for a single huge fuckup to ruin you. Nobody is perfect, but managing crypto demands perfection. If you send your entire stack off to some rando etherscan spoofer or directly to the token contract itself, there's no getting it back.

* When you're confirming an address, check it from two different devices running different OSes. One device can be compromised; two heterogeneous devices are unlikely to be compromised by the same hacker at the same time.

* If your wallet looks a little different than it usually does, panic. You'll need to learn breathing exercises to panic properly without harming yourself too much. But the 1% chance you catch something malicious is worth the 99% of the time where a wallet software update changed things around a bit.

* If your seed phrase has ever been typed into any device that physically has a wifi chip in it, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.

* Corollary: If you did something "clever" like write your seed phrase into a poem, it's still compromised. We're in the AI age now, so you have to protect your seed not only from malicious actors but from their smart AI bot armies who you have to assume will be combing through that poetry you wrote in 10th grade that's in that dropbox account you forgot about, trying random combinations of words in hopes that it derives an active private key.

* If you have ever said your seed phrase out loud in earshot of a device that has a microphone and a wifi chip (cell phone, non-airgapped pc, smart tv...), your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.

* If your seed phrase has ever been in view of any camera on any device, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.

* If your seed phrase ever looks at you a little cockeyed like he wants treats, but you already gave him his treats today, he's compromised and sadly you need to put him down.

* If you do not know the specific method by which entropy was collected to generate your keys, your keys are compromised. The gold standard is to use physical dice to generate your seed phrase, and make sure you roll 'em around in your hands a lot. Bitcoin OGs remember Diceware.

* If your ETH is wrapped in some way or another, you don't own ETH, you own an IOU for ETH. You are owed by a company and/or a contract. Companies go bankrupt, contracts get hacked. If you must hold IOUs, spread them out, but beware correlation risks that may be hiding themselves (ftx/celsius/blockfi/voyager/genesis/3ac is a great example of a hidden correlation risk).

* You need to learn the basics of cryptography. Creating and managing keys without knowing cryptography basics is like trying to drive a car without knowing the rules of the road.

* You need to learn the basics of computer security. Learn what makes hacking attempts successful. Learn what CTF is, and learn about the ways hackers and social engineers typically gain access to systems. Imagine you are a hacker with full pwned access to your own main daily driver computer, and imagine how you would try to steal your crypto.

* Keep yourself up all night worrying about your wallet security. If you wanted to have a peaceful low-stress life, you should have gotten a government 9-5 instead of getting into crypto. If you really need some sleep, buy some melatonin and a weighted blanket. Don't fuck with Ambien - the government puts chips in the pills that program you to go get your seed phrase in the middle of the night and text it to the cia.

* Don't fuck with Ledger.

* Don't fuck with Binance.

* If you are a regulatory agency, use 2-factor auth on your fucking twitter account.

My general paranoia has saved me several times since I started investing in crypto in the early 2010s. Remember, they ARE trying to get your keys. Always. You need to be perfect every time to win, they only need you to fuck up a single time to win, so the game is tilted in their favor. They will never stop, so you have to never stop defending.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18smom7/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2023/kf9svsx/)

Saw it mentioned yesterday, but I think [Vitalik's latest thinking](https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989) on Ethereum's positioning within the blockchain trilemma design space deserves further discussion. For me this feels like it has the potential to be a large pivot in core Ethereum philosophy and my initial gut feeling is one of discomfort.

Ethereum has up until now allowed anyone with 32 ETH and moderate technical ability to run a validator. At least two of the options discussed by Vitalik in his post would reduce the decentralisation of Ethereum.

The Ethereum community are a pragmatic bunch who don't see things in black and white. Technical solutions require compromise and decentralisation is a spectrum. Even so abandoning the principle of a relatively small fish being able to validate within the network without having to trust 3rd parties feels like a real departure from a long held value.

<summary>u/CaptainOfTheGate covers the best Staking as a Service/SaaS providers</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18smom7/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2023/kfb6edi/)

**The Best Staking-as-a-Service (SAAS) Providers**

In approximate order, based mostly on their reputation among Redditors (I read more than I post). For each of these, the user controls their withdrawal keys. 

**Allnodes**

It's $10/month for their Advanced plan, which is the cheapest one that includes MEV (it's worth the extra $5/month). That's equivalent to a fee of only 0.16%, close to zero! They're a top-15% performer on Rated Network over the last 30 days, and mostly use the Teku (a minority client) consensus client; they're also large, if that gives you comfort: 2.6% of all staked ether. 

**Ethpool**

They charge 15% of MEV (10% for 3 nodes, 8% for 30 nodes). That comes out to about 2.9% of all rewards (so yes, about 18x Allnodes). I can't find them on Rated Network. They use minority clients: Lighthouse and Nethermind. 

**Blox Staking**

They have a 0% fee forever (not a typo). Their effectiveness rating on Rated Network is below the 50th percentile as I write this. The company behind them is probably more focused on their new SSV Network now. I noticed that their website gets barely any traffic anymore (it ranks in the millions), but Rated Network says they still stake about 0.53% of staked ether, and they have an active Discord. They use mostly Prysm (the most popular consensus client). 

**Best solution for leftover amounts when you've staked all your 32-ETH blocks:**

Competition in staking is heating up daily (e.g. with DVT solutions coming online), but I'll nominate StakeWise v3. You can stake any amount and don't need to get an LST. You get to choose an operator. Perhaps 4% fees is typical, but I see one offering 1%. Some reputable operators to consider are x (please reply with your opinions). 

**Some reasons you might want to use SAAS:**

You don't want LSTs because you'd have to generate a capital gain when selling ETH for them; and they have high fees, typically 10% for Lido's stETH. 

You don't want to solo stake because you may not feel technically competent enough; you may have unreliable internet (or limited capacity) or electricity; or you may not have a stable place for your node (e.g. you're a digital nomad).

<summary>u/superphiz has a smart contract shower thought</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18smom7/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2023/kf9xmhu/)

I had a shower thought that I wanted to crank out before I forget it. I probably won't format it well, just trying to dump the idea.

Smart contracts are the basic building blocks, not the infrastructure of web3.

Smart contracts are more like transistors.. or more realistically simple circuits. They can do very small tasks, but having a box of simple circuits doesn't really give you extraordinary power. Imagine having a bunch of [555 timer chips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzjmAbyyIQ) - it's a simple but powerful tool, but by itself  it's not revolutionary.

The power of simple circuits comes when you string a bunch of them together to do something even more powerful. 

We're at the beginning of smart circuit development - when several contracts can work together to complete more powerful functions. From where we're standing this seems difficult and complex. The Intel 8080 processor had [6000 transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080), but the i9-13xxx series have [25 BILLION](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/how-many-transistors-on-raptor-lake-cpus.3791683/). We haven't even reached the capacity of building a smart circuit that includes 10-20 smart transistors/smart contracts yet.

Another way to imagine this is from an evolutionary perspective. We think about this stuff called [Primodial Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_soup), the idea that a bunch of the right building blocks (amino acids) in the same place at the right time can give rise to more complex biological compounds. Our current primordial soup is the library of smart contracts we're building now, and in time these basic building blocks will evolve into highly complex organisms. 

All of this to say.. we're at the beginning of all of this. We have the foundational building blocks to build complex contraptions that we can't even imagine yet, but given the historical context of building blocks that get organized, it's exceedingly likely that we're on the cusp of rapid evolution in smart contracts.

https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/12/28/cypherpunk.html

>This is why it's valuable for Ethereum to have a strong social layer, which vigorously enforces its values in those places where pure incentives can't - but without creating a notion of "Ethereum alignment" that turns into a new form of political correctness.

I already felt some influencers were wielding "Ethereum alignment" as a weapon to criticize projects and L2s. Sometimes it's warranted and sometimes you could feel that they were just posturing for their brand. You can feel the "sliminess"...it's just off putting. Like seeing the the lazer eyes profile pics.

My favorite section is **What are some of these values?**

Vitalik prefectly describes what brought so many of us into crypto when it was solely BTC and dreams of what crypto could eventually do. 

A few years later and the space has evolved so much - taking steps towards achieving some of those grand visions. But in taking those steps, we sacrificed the values that gave crypto any real meaningful value. Why remake the the same thing but worse? The values he outlines in the section are core to crypto and give the space value. Devs need to embrace it and figure a way to make it appealing to consumers. The easy path is centralization. The rewarding path is decentralization.

> It is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these values. One can build a system that one calls a "layer 2", but which is actually a highly centralized system secured by a multisig, with no plans to ever switch to something more secure. 
> 
> One can build an account abstraction system that tries to be "simpler" than ERC-4337, but at the cost of introducing trust assumptions that end up removing the possibility of a public mempool and make it much harder for new builders to join. 
> 
> One could build an NFT ecosystem where the contents of the NFT are needlessly stored on centralized websites, making it needlessly more fragile than if those compoents are stored on IPFS. 
> 
> One could build a staking interface that needlessly funnels users toward the already-largest staking pool.
> 
> Resisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps.

[u/domingo_mon](https://reddit.com/u/domingo_mon):

2023 is coming to a close and I want to reflect on what Ethereum means to this community. I have two questions.

**Why do you hold Ether?**

**What is something that Ethereum could accomplish that you can look back in 50 years and say "I held through the bear because I believed in Ethereum's ..." Or "Ethereum is a success to me because it ..."?**

&#x200B;

For me, I got into crypto in general because I believe that the global financial system is rigged. Anything worth owning became more and more expensive every year, and the dream of owning a home or land became further and further out of reach. [It felt like I was on one side of a ballon and my dreams were on the other side.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ifyjoz_2QbPd5X3A.jpg) The balloon was being inflated, and it felt like my dreams were literally being inflated away.

Bitcoin struck a chord in me because it espouses transparency, fiscal responsibility, and financial freedom. Here was a money that couldn't be printed into oblivion. Here was a money that wasn't first distributed to the mega-banks and the mega-rich where they buy up assets, creating inflation before finally filtering down to us little people. Here was a money that couldn't be confiscated because the owners embrace ideas that weren't popular. Here was a money that could be sent across the world at the speed of light, 24/7. Here was a money that was controlled by everyday people and not some nameless, unelected, unaccountable, government bureaucrat.

I believe that Bitcoin ossified too soon, and r/Bitcoin started banning anyone who suggested that the code should be upgraded.

That's when I found Ethereum. It was a project that had similar characteristics and desires of Bitcoin but, unlike bitcoin, it was going to continue developing. I hope for Ethereum to become a neutral, global settlement layer.  I hold Ether because I want to be a part of the money revolution. I want my children to inherit a world with a fair financial system where the average person can get ahead by saving their ether because the value of their ether isn't being inflated away.

[u/EnvironmentDry1343](https://reddit.com/u/EnvironmentDry1343):

Alright I'll bite, with the preface that a bunch of this is at least inspired by if not outright copied from posts from other people writing about Ethereum. 

For me it is about increased coordination/cooperation. I'd been reading about bitcoin for years and didn't really care about it because discussion was often centered around antagonism: a big bad 'They' that controlled this rigged system versus the persecuted victims seeking a new beginning. To me, btc has always seemed more like religion than anything else.

It wasn't until I starting reading about Ethereum that I saw the value in the underpinnings of this new religion. Blockchains, when well designed and implemented, allow people to interact/transact without centralized actors. 

People get more done when they work together and the history of human progress is in my opinion the history of humans learning how to cooperate more and kill each other less. Unfortunately, working together usually means giving power to a small group of people that oversee things and are given a mandate to make choices on behalf of others. These centralized actors all too often become corrupted, and the biggest man-made disasters would never be possible without a bunch of centralized actors abusing or misusing their power ("lol lets go kill all the sparrows").

Ethereum obviously is not going to solve the problem of centralized power on its own, but it is one of the few developments that I have seen during my life that allow for improved cooperation without increased centralization. To me, that's big and that's worth sticking around for. 

It is unfortunately also why I haven't been as bearish about Ethereum in the past as I am now. A few years ago the question was "How do we implement this new tool in a credibly neutral way?", a technical question with a *relatively* easily definable answer. Now the question seems to be "Do we really care about decentralization/credible neutrality or do we just want memecoins?". To me (and I suspect most others here) the answer is clear but we have some convincing to do in the broader community. 

So I believe in Ethereum's credible neutrality. If we somehow manage to maintain that for the next 50 years, we're golden in my opinion.

TLDR: Ethereum is potentially one of the all too few positive recent developments that might bring humanity forward (even if only by a little bit).

[u/Pkickel92](https://reddit.com/u/Pkickel92):

I may have a massive misunderstanding on how the L2 to eth chain relationship works/will work, so I was hoping for some clarification.

Currently, I need to bridge my eth over the the L2 chain which costs a relatively high fee. I can then interact with the L2 and eventually bridge back if I choose to. My understanding is that this is the currently the only way L2 talks with L1. Is this correct? If this is the case, I do not see how Ethereum fees will ever get down to the prices of other L1 solutions which I believe is needed for mass/mainstream adoption since we are currently performing about 15 tps.

Is there someway Ethereum (L1) is getting this data in real time that I am missing? If not and you are forced to stay on L2s (more centralized) to have reasonable transaction what is the benefit of this setup over other L1s like Solona, Polkadot, etc.

Any explanation would be greatly appreciated.

[u/hanniabu](https://reddit.com/u/hanniabu):

I think your understanding of how the rollups operate. When you bridge the only communication happening is the rollup's balance sheet is updated to reflect the addition/withdrawal of this transaction. 

In terms of consensus, for optimistic rollups (e.g. optimism, arbitrum) all the transactions happening on the rollup are compressed (like a zip file) and verified by L1. For zkrollups (e.g. zksync, scroll) a mathematical proof is created for all the transactions and all L1 has to do is verify the proof. 

As L2 blocks get more transactions, the cost per transaction goes down as the shared costs are spread out across more transactions (economies of scale).

(Tangent: The compression of optimistic rollups requires less of the L2 and more of the L1 (and hence more cost). For zkrollups generating the proof requires a lot of effort from the L2, but is very cheap for the L1 to verify.)

L2 blocks don't happen at the same time as L1. They vary depending on the rollup, but I think most have a target of 2 seconds per block. Ethereum blocks are 12 seconds, so there's 6 L2 blocks in each L1 block.

So L2s benefit from math and compression for more efficient settlement as well as economies of scale to provide cheaper transactions. This will get even cheaper after the update in the next few months (\~april 2024) by creating a separate fee market for L1 blockspace specifically dedicated for L2s. So they no longer need to be competing with L1 transactions for blockspace. This change also makes transactions costs more predictable for rollups, rather than needing to slightly overcharge to account for any potential unexpected gas spikes.

After this update L2 transactions will get cheaper (estimated at up to 1/100th depending on rollup design), falling in the range of a few cents to maybe even less than a penny in some cases.

<summary>u/interweaver is still fighting the good fight to diversify the stake. He later shares some results from such good work in action!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18wi7t1/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2024/kg0r4b1/)

Hey EthFinance, happy 2024! I have some good news to start off the year :D

Something like 15% of all staked Ether is staked through Coinbase, and only a little over a month ago, they posted in a [blog post](https://www.coinbase.com/de/cloud/discover/customer-stories/cb-wallet) that they're using 100% Geth to operate that stake.

We're still in the grips of a Geth client supermajority, with an estimated [75%](https://etherclients.com/) to [85%](https://execution-diversity.info/) of staked Ether using Geth under the hood, so Coinbase's 15% stake using 100% Geth is a big impediment to bringing that number down below 66%, where we'll be safe from an instant catastrophic fork if Geth has a forking bug.

Over the last month, some of you who are on Twitter/X may have been following my campaign to tweet every day at Coinbase to try to get them to diversify their Ethereum execution clients. This was partly an informational campaign to make more people aware of the issues supermajority clients like Geth present, and partly a gentle pressure campaign to get Coinbase to consider switching.

Today this campaign led to a [clarifying tweet from Will Robinson](https://twitter.com/willrobinson23/status/1742211630342299822), VP of Engineering at Coinbase, that Coinbase is definitely planning to diversify their staking execution clients!

There's no timeline associated with this, so I expect it might still take a few months, but it's very exciting that they've finally publicly confirmed that they are aligned on client diversity, and are working towards that goal internally.

I don't think my daily tweets changed any internal Coinbase policy; they've likely been working on this for a while already. But it did enable us to get a public statement from them on their client diversity plans!

If you're interested in my (now concluded) tweet campaign, you can see [my most recent one here](https://twitter.com/arboraeth/status/1742219571543646292), with links to the previous tweets.

Thanks everyone who supported that campaign, and also for every one of you who's running a node with minority execution clients! I'm super hopeful that we can finally get Ethereum to a place of full client diversity in 2024, with resilience against any single client's forking bug.

Happy 2024, EthFinance!

I made a longer post on this below but it looks like it might be hidden, so I'll just share the punchline -

Coinbase (or a high-up employee, rather) [committed today](https://twitter.com/willrobinson23/status/1742211630342299822) to diversifying their staked Ether away from supermajority client Geth!

This is amazing news given they're currently running 100% Geth with 15% of all staked Ether.

I'm considerably more optimistic now that this year will be the year Ethereum achieves full client diversity!

<summary>u/MrVodnik shares some key pointers on keeping your funds secure when signing on new websitesd</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18wi7t1/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2024/kg12t25/)

Oh, it's a complex one. 

tl;dr; There are two types of approvals. Don't sign what you don't understand. Otherwise, you'll be fine. 

Signing is all that your wallet do. If you prepare a signature of a tx, someone else can send this out. So the rule of thumb is - don't sign anything you don't understand. I.e., avoid signing "hex" data that is not translatable to human-readable text (e.g. don't sign "0x2b3cf00321a..." but sign "I agree to terms and services of xyz"). 

When it comes to approvals, these are NOT part of the Ethereum protocol! What we come to understand as approvals, is an ERC20 method to allow other parties (mainly contracts) to move your funds. In most (if not all) of legit ERC20 contracts/tokens, it works as expected, and in scamy ones - you don't care about them anyway. It is good to understand what and how a malicious signature/transaction can do to your funds. Considering above - it can only drain ERC20 that you've approved. If you hold more exotic items in your wallet, then its up to you to verify how they act.

When it comes to approvals, there are two main types out there. The first one is the standard "approve" function of the ERC20 spec, which sets on-chain record of whom and for how much, can move the token in question. The second one is "permit2" introduced by Uniswap and slowly adopted by other dApps. It extends standard approval systems and **allows off-chain approvals**, which I guess is what you're asking about.

<summary>u/benido2030 has the monthly staking update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18wi7t1/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2024/kfysit4/)

**Here's the ninth edition of the monthly staking update**   
First monthly staking update for 2024. Obviously the state of staking will be something to watch this year. A lot of people expect way more ETH staked, especially *if* there is an ETH ETF and it is allowed to stake the underlying ETH. Lido dominance will be something to have an eye on. Then there is eigenlayer of course... And maybe if there are some solo staker airdrops, we will also see new inflows from "small guys". So let's dive in! 

**Validator overview - total: 1051685 validators\***

&#x200B;

* 901635 active (December: 881447; +20188 / +2,2%, | May: 554322; +347313 / +62%)
* 384 pending (December: 388; -4 / -1% | May: 15537; -15153 / -97,5%)
* 0 exiting (December: 722; 0 / -100% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)
* 205331 exited (December: 169613; +35718 / +21% | May: 39341; +165990 / +422%)

The validator set keeps on growing. The growth isn't crazy and there are also continuous exits every month, but generally speaking number go up. Right now we are at 24,2% of all ETH staked. In my opinion, there's nothing really "fancy" to see here. 

  
**Client diversity numbers\*\***  
*Consensus*

* Prysm 41% (December: 41%, May: 38%)
* Lighthouse 33% (December: 34%, May: 37%)
* Teku 16% (December: 16%, May: 17%)
* Nimbus 8% (December: 7%, May: 6%)
* Lodestar 1% (December: 1%, May: 1%)

*Execution*

* Geth 84% (December: 84%)
* Nethermind 8% (December: 8%)
* Erigon 2% (December: 2%)
* Besu 5% (December: 5%)

Client diversity is more or less the same it was at the end of last year. Nimbus slightly gaining share, which is good, but not really important, since Consensus clients are looking okay.   
Execution keeps on being an issue. Geth's share with a constant 84% is still way too high. How can we change that? 

1. Switch from Geth to a minority client. It *really* isn't that hard and might have other benefits like a better feature set (e.g. auto pruning), which might help to make a decision. 
2. There is e.g. [Arbora.eth](https://x.com/arboraeth/status/1741947346206826699?s=20) on Twitter asking Coinbase to stop using Geth as their sole execution client. Join them, retweet, post, pressure bigger entities to change their setup. I think retweeting is rather low effort, but might help to spread the word. 

  
**Pool distribution\*\*\***

* Lido 31,7% (December: 32,3%)
* Coinbase 14,3% (December: 14,2%)
* Binance 3,7% (December: 4,1%)
* Rocket Pool 2,9% (December: 2,9%)
* Kraken 2,8% (December: 2,7%)  
\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.

With the launch of Blast Lido was gaining market share last month. This has stopped and interestingly Lido is basically back to 31,x% like before the launch. Now obviously we can't really tell where it would be without Blast, but my guess is lower and in a best case the launch only pushed it up temporarily and market share will continue to fall. 

Obviously we should not rely on the market handling it! If you have (w)stETH please think about withdrawing from Lido and/ or depositing into Diva. If you participate in the "Diva vampire attack" you will not only receive a new LST but also Diva tokens. Interestingly Diva already has 0.4% market share and hasn't even launched yet. Let's make that number go up!   
All percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.

P.S. Completely unrelated, but Murs 3:16 (The 9th Edition) produced by 9th Wonder is imo still one of the best LPs ever. 9th is an incredible producer and I really like Murs flow. He's probably not the best lyricist, but innovative and even had a track about Bitcoin in like 2016 or 2017.

<summary>u/ElectricMutiny shares their story of loss as a warning for each of us to look after our own ETH carefully</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18xc4ml/daily_general_discussion_january_3_2024/kg3w4tf/)

Two days ago I wrote in the daily about how I lost all of my holdings. The next two days were the worst in my grown up life, just hours of hours of despair and sleepless anxiety. The worst part was seeing all of my ETH in that foreign wallet address, so close, yet so far away. 

Today is better. The sun is shining. I have my little apartment and my family and friends. I did realise some gains during the last bull run which i reinvested in something safer. And my sister still have her holdings, and I will enjoy seeing her get rich during the upcoming bull. She deserves it. 

So take my carelessness, my stupidity, as a warning. If you are not careful, you will get recked.

**Grifting 101**

1. Find the grift. Contrary to popular belief, you never need to start your own grift, just find one that's in progress and join in.
2. Fill your bags. It's EXTREMELY important that you fill BEFORE you shill. If you're joining the grift too late, you're only going to be exit liquidity, so it's important that you join a grift as early as possible. Bonus points here if you're an accredited investor and you can buy into the grift early before the retail investors (you're going to need them later!).
3. Buy the narrative. It doesn't really matter what the narrative is: "faster than bitcoin", "cheaper smart contracts", "tons of partnerships", "a new banking system", "Visa-level capacity". Whatever. It doesn't matter what the grift is as long as you know it. The BEST grifts include promises of future activity and "unlocks".
4. Shill like your life depends on it. This is where you REALLY earn your money. Just like any ponzi, you'll need to convince EVERYONE to buy into the grift because you need the price to go up and you need tons of exit liquidity so you don't get dumped on. You'll need to tap into all the socials you can, and even better if you can get podcast/youtube hits. Use whatever tactics work for you: education, insight, sarcasm, humor.. it doesn't matter. The goal is just to saturate the ecosystem with discussion about the grift. It doesn't matter whether the traffic is flattering or not, you're just looking for saturation. If you do a good job, you'll get free rent in everyone's mind AND you'll amplify the power of the shill.
5. Wait for the flywheel to kick in. With enough social activity, the flywheel will eventually kick in. This means that the price will go parabolic because the social work has made everyone aware of the grift, and when they see price movement they'll have fomo and buy in. The MOMENT the flywheel effect kicks in you've GOT to be on your toes to prepare your exit. THIS is where retail investors are critical. You're looking for dudes who want to make a quick buck and put all of their faith in charts. These are the guys who will put their "fun money" into the grift in hopes of maybe buying a car or something with the money they make.
6. The parabolic spike/game of chicken. Timing here is critical. Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors are primed to dump hard, so since you're lower on the food chain you'll need to dump first. This is the game of chicken: you need to dump BEFORE everyone else does. This is pretty easy, take 10x and get the hell out of there - no one wants to be left holding this worthless shit. (If you're a dumbass, you'll hold too long and be the exit liquidity. If this happens once, you'll survive, but if this happens more than once you need to quit grifting - you're not a grifter, you're just dumb exit liquidity. )
7. The crash will come, but you'll have made a fuckton of money and you're sitting pretty, but you CAN'T stop now! if you only survive one grift you'll die poor. The crash requires a lot of continued social activity to SIMULTANEOUSLY convince all of your followers that you were duped just like them, but ALSO that you made a ton of money. You've GOT to maintain your credibility if you're going to grift again. Don't blow this step! Your followers need to build faith in your ability during this stage.
8. Okay, so you completed a successful grift! Congratulations!! You might get 5-6 grift cycles out of the same coin if the climate is right. This is harder if the grift had promises of future activity, but those are really sweet because you'll make a LOT more money on it. Most grifters will take a month off before spending another six month cycle pumping the next grift. In that month off, they'll re-establish their credibility by promoting solid assets like Ether. So, I mean, grifters really are good folks after all, right?

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains Gearbox V3</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18nfxvo/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2023/kedembr/)

As ever, I wish we had more discussion around here about app developments on Ethereum rather than... whatever the depressive topics have been the past few days.

In the spirit of being the change I want to see in the world let me plug Gearbox V3. Basically Gearbox is a leverage application that removes the leverage component from the underlying application and allows you to apply leverage using Defi legos on their own. Think of it like 'modular Defi'. The key insight that enabled leverage is that when you borrow funds, the funds aren't given to you, they are held in escrow by the protocol so you can't just run off with them. Now, there's no sense having the protocol just hold onto borrowed funds. The reason you're borrowing is to do *something*. So, since you aren't being given the funds the protocol has to do that something on your behalf.

For older leverage applications, the something they would do on your behalf *was* the application. You could use dydx and get leveraged price exposure to an asset but the leverage was tightly coupled to a dex. This leads to liquidity fragmentation. While the nature of the price exposure mechanism changed with apps like GMX, perps still tightly couple the liquidity source for leverage with their application. By contrast, Gearbox allows you to execute leveraged strategies that actually execute against Curve or Uniswap.

To execute a strategy with Gearbox you put up your collateral, borrow the funds required to execute your strategy, and then execute it using a plugin to any Defi application they support. For example if you wanted to go 3x long, you could put up 1x collateral, borrow 3x whatever you're shorting, swap to 3x of your long asset using any supported Dex, and hold that position while paying interest on the borrow. When plugged into something like Aave this also let's you do fancy stuff like profit from [interest rate spreads](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads) or leverage your way into a Curve LP Yearn pool which auto compounds rewards back to you. The potential here is open ended and incredible.

Gearbox v3 does a few cool things. First it allows borrowers to have better granularity on which position is secured by which collateral. The basic idea is they create a smart contract with your name on it that is executed according to a strategy you configure. Second it enables lenders to underwrite their own risk and choose what types of risk their funds are exposed to. This is a common trend I've seen lately in Defi. We are steadily moving away from pooling everyone into the same risk bracket and moving towards programmable money where everyone can adjust their own risk.

If you have time I'd suggest you [dig in](https://blog.gearbox.fi/building-and-expanding-the-onchain-credit-layer/) or you know, [try it yourself](https://app.gearbox.fi/). It's far more fun to focus on exciting things happening at home than to focus on narrative noise from CT and bring it here.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18nfxvo/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2023/keemcbk/)

Alright so got hacked for the first time

Well "hacked", I accidentally approved something in metamask that allowed them to take all my eth and one NFT. 

Like 24k USD worth in total, which isnt the end of the world luckily enough. Luckily my main stack isnt on this adress. 

I got fooled because I was trying to do the Frame airdrop and when looking at their twitter (the correct twitter) a fake frame account with a check mark (thanks for that Elon) were in their replies and I wasnt observant enough. 

idiotic of me, but anyway

I still want to utilise this adress to claim airdrops and the like but I obviously cant do so when I have this hanging over it. I'm looking at the approvals checker on etherscan but cant find any approvals I did today or any access given today, so this fraudulent acces/approval isnt there. 

Does anyone else know how I do/how I should do to remove their access to my address?

Thanks for any help

Edit: Also I suppose it doesnt matter now so for any interested sleuths heres my address for your perusal: [0x139373F9FFeDCf909518096fC165f3b87fD7046C](https://etherscan.io/address/0x139373F9FFeDCf909518096fC165f3b87fD7046C)

After looking over it it doesnt seem like I have any offending approvals. Is it possible for a phisher to have some other kind of access still? 


Edit 2: The offending transactions seem to have been these ones, in this chronological order: 

<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x07344545d7b3e3ce7032dc5319ee9e3dbce291bcdbe3b798982055bb7b6a6567>

<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b7a6c41aed26af4280b24c7da787b0b5732a43e34bf81d6cea79c02857c2bed>

What I'm worried about now is that the scammer can repeat some function in order to drain my adress again in the future, if I fill it with some ETH for gas for example 

If anyone with that are above my hobbyist level of ability could help tell me if anything in these transactions point to this being repeatable I would greatly appreciate it! (or just point me in a helpful direction would be really nice too)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18o7zxl/daily_general_discussion_december_22_2023/keg0art/)

There have been too many people being scammed out of some of their crypto holdings with the recent frame airdrop. The frame airdrop is legit, there are just too many fake claim websites wanting your money. If you use the network please consider installing/enabling transaction previews. These help you understanding what you are actually signing before it gets broadcasted:

Either use:

- Rabby Wallet which has this included in their wallet already. It is on the very paranoid side, so maybe you start clicking the warnings away automatically after some time.

- Use Metamask snaps which provide this. I shortly tested Wallet Guard which does the job. I am sure there are other good options in their security section: <https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/>

- Install an additional extension like pocket universe or fire. I use both of them in parallel for many months now. Every time I receive a signing request they pop up and inform me about what I am going to sign.

All of these solutions put another actor in your signing process which could get attacked. Be aware of that. I am also not sure how much information is shared with whom in all these solutions. The additional extensions have served me well in the last months in combination with the frame wallet. I think the Rabby wallet is the most user friendly one, but a bit too paranoid for my taste, especially if you are using very new protocols. 

I tested all of these solutions on my go-to scam website I found some time ago, a tornado cash fork, which wants to steal all my funds. All of the above solution told me exactly what I sign and Metamask even wanted to prevent me from visiting the scam site.

<summary>u/strawdar summarises the new ETH research proposal</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18oz4wq/daily_general_discussion_december_23_2023/kemdljh/)

So if I'm reading this proposal correctly:

1. Beacon stakers would no longer receive MEV rewards

2. MEV relays would sort of be replaced by execution ticket markets. This opens up the possibility to introduce burn on what today is MEV rewards.

3. Block builders would buy execution tickets and run execution proposers

EDIT: I think I'm making some assumptions on number 3, because the proposal says this is orthogonal to PBS. So number 3 could involve multiple parties or it could not.

EDIT2: Before stakers get up in arms about MEV rewards going away, this proposal would open up a new avenue for speculation on execution tickets: "Explicitly defining an execution proposer lottery allows validators to participate only by choice. If they like the idea of flipping a coin and getting a high-value slot, they are free to buy execution tickets."

EDIT3: More stuff is sinking in now. You could in theory choose to run your validators in a mode similar to today by configuring them to purchase an execution ticket for each upcoming slot, but the cost of that ticket will be market driven while today they are essentially distributed uniformly and randomly.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18poy1s/daily_general_discussion_december_24_2023/kepw80a/)

If you frequent crypto Twitter and are feeling doubt about ETH, and FOMO or anger over Solana, it‚Äôs worth checking yourself and asking why you‚Äôre invested the way you are, and why you feel like that way. Personally speaking the vast majority of my stack is, has been, and will remain ETH because I can hold it and sleep well at night expecting it to go up over time with minimal downside risk relative to other crypto assets. It has arguably the best fundamentals of any asset, not only in crypto, but in any market. On short time horizons it won‚Äôt always or even often perform the best, especially in a bull market where narratives rule the day, but it *will* provide the best risk adjusted returns imo, and wealth preservation can be just as difficult if not more, than capital appreciation. I‚Äôm still buying.

&nbsp;

Having said that, The recent performance of Solana, and other tokens that are purely speculative bets, is a great example of why it pays to be open minded and why it can be helpful to diversify. I maintain a percentage of my portfolio for speculative bets, trading, gambling, etc. Doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, you have to be honest and cut yourself off if you‚Äôre just burning capital, but it‚Äôs fun, curbs FOMO, and ideally lets me capture some additional upside from narratives or short term plays. I missed Solana, but made some gains on WIF, and had some fun shit posting with friends about it in our own internal group chats. Also have some medium-term holds and narratives I plan to dabble in this bull market.

&nbsp;

It‚Äôs easy in crypto, especially if you‚Äôre on CT, to feel like you‚Äôre in a rat race against everyone else, look at gains someone else has made off of something you consider vaporware, and let it upset you. Even easier to let narratives that ETH is dead and that X-coin with no fundamentals is the future of France upset you. Don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôve been here for the bear and have been buying ETH then you‚Äôre up too. Normies aren‚Äôt even here yet. Enjoy the ride. Be happy for newer or smaller participants coming into money for the first time. This is how crypto grows. Most importantly do not feed into tribal hate. Talking down about the ecosystem that just made users money doesn‚Äôt attract participants to our ecosystem or encourage learning, it just pits you against them and feeds into negative sentiment. Be welcoming and focus that energy towards more productive endeavors. Learn from Vitalik. It‚Äôs impossible to hate a guy that is perpetually positive towards others. And he does an excellent job framing all of crypto as an ‚Äúus‚Äù vs the them, if I do say so myself. <https://x.com/matthuang/status/1738810362022232210>

&nbsp;

In the end I think the Ethereum ecosystem will capture Solana‚Äôs moat, but that time is not now. If you too think that time will come, good news, you can position for it. These are my biggest catalysts for ETH this year:


* **4844** will drastically reduce gas fees for L2s. A world where Arbitrum/Optimism/ZKsync/etc is as cheap as Solana is a level playing field at attracting normies, memes, whatever. New L2s will create new opportunities for airdrops and new apps that take off. 
* **A potential ETH ETF** will create a speculative demand for ETH like nothing else. Even if it doesn‚Äôt go through people will buy in anticipation 
* **Restaking** is the most under-discussed catalyst for ETH the asset. Not only will you have a deflationary asset with native yields, but potentially with ponzy-like yields. If ETH approaches even close to 20% yield from restaking at any point the demand will be massive. Especially if the ETF brings in more traditional investors.

&nbsp;

**Basically what I‚Äôm saying is this:** we should all be happy that the bull market seems to be back, and that we all have the opportunity to make money again in the coming year. If you disagree and are still bearish than maybe this post isn‚Äôt for you. Either way, enjoy the holidays, and may golden showers rain upon /r/ethfinance dailies every week for the next year!

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi reflects on a year of delegate representation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18r1c9q/daily_general_discussion_december_26_2023/kezzi27/)

In the spirit of year-end reflection and New Year's resolutions, I am looking for feedback / suggestions regarding my delegating duties of ARB and HOP I've taken on this year. Asking as I'm still relatively new to this and want to improve when I can - don't be shy or holdback anything in feedback. For some context, my goal has largely been to take on these roles to help get some of the great minds on r/ethfinance a way to feel represented in governance. I'm not sure that has happened to the extent I've envisioned, but hopefully I'm making *some* impact and will grow into that in the future. 

Obviously, I have no way to tell who actually delegates to me, but I'm assuming a bulk of the people are those who post here. So figured this was the best place to ask. So in short, do let me know if there are things you think I can improve on or ways you felt I've let you down. As well as things I've done that you would like to see me keep doing. Even if you aren't specifically a delegate to me.

Some thoughts / questions of my own:

Voting Transparency --- I do try to post DAO updates here both for informational purposes and to keep myself transparent. I know following actually Tally / Snapshot votes is a pain, so I hope this helps. Unfortunately, ARB is a little difficult since the forum links are shadow-banned. I do try to comment in the Arbitrum / HOP forums on my votes where it feels warranted (or on the actual Snapshot votes themselves). No good way around the ARB problem, but I do link the votes and do a summary of decision here to help with that. I also try to wait until a few votes have passed to 'batch' my updates and avoid clogging up the daily toooo much, however if people would prefer immediate updates (say, within a few days of the vote ending) I can switch to that. 

Voting Participation --- I do try to vote on everything that comes up, since that is ultimately the fundamental role here. Regrettably, I did miss a few votes over my time doing this. I think about 5 or 6 overall earlier in the summer across both DAOs. No excuses, and I've made sure not to miss stuff going forward. I'll add, the Arbitrum STIP voting I did probably vote in maybe 1/4th of the total pool of candidates. The structure was a major issue IMO, which I brought up in the DAO forums. Expecting delegates to vet and vote on 100+ projects in that timeframe was impossible, and it does sound like future STIP / LTIPs are making note of that. And I'm not sure many delegates did vote in 100% of those (hats off to those who did). Sort of a one-off, but wanted to clarify that situation, and I do wish in hindsight I took a little more time for that.

Calls --- I do try to attend the ARB and HOP calls when I can. I work full time, so it's as schedule permits (although ARB does record the call and HOP has notes). ARB I've been admittedly lacking, but I've been better having joined the last 2. This is one of my top goals, to have better attendance here. My Q here is this - do people want updates on this type of thing? Is that too much? It sort of goes along the lines of r/ethfinance input as I'll discuss below. 

r/Ethfinance Input --- I know sort of the point of being a delegate is so that people don't have to worry about day to day minutia. However, I do want to feel out people's opinion on this. For notable / larger / more controversial topics should I try to reach out for input more? Do people rather just me 'read the room' and vote that way. I try to vote in a way that is best for the particular DAOs & the Ethereum chain, but again I want to leverage the mindshare that is here to do that as I am still only human. Also, I want to re-iterate that I welcome people to reach out. that doesn't happen much, so if there are ways people think I can be more inviting, for a lack of a better word, let me know. I'd love to be able to be a bridge between ideas here and ultimately discussion in front of said DAOS. 

Updates --- Basically, a mis-mash of the above. I want to walk the line as best I can between over and under updating on issues. So thoughts on this would be appreciated!

Twitter --- I don't really like Twitter, but I made one as I can't stick my head in the sand. I don't really use it that much... I'd be curious to those who think if I should use it more? I'm thinking maybe just doing updates there as well for those who follow. I don't want to dive into CT degeneracy, but I probably should use it as a space to get updates out?

And finally, a thank you! There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not aware of the number of people that trust me with this. I know governance isn't that sexy of a thing, but it's really cool that people feel they can trust their vote with me and that isn't lost.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18rth8u/daily_general_discussion_december_27_2023/kf4l80v/)

Interesting you're saying this today, I was just thinking about how lost a newcomer is in this space. Even if they found this subreddit, (could you imagine the lost faith in crypto if they visited r/cc or even r/Ethereum first?) I'm not so sure it would be obvious this is the place to trust or realize this sub is putting out the most critical/thoughtful info/discussion.

Imagine someone out there today (which I'm sure happens everyday) says, today is the day I'm going to get into crypto. Ugh, I'm getting a migraine just thinking about being that person. 

Legitimately, im wondering where that person goes. The options are wild. Crypto Twitter, YouTube, reddit, discord, overall asking Google? Ooof. All of those can be very hit or miss with more misses than hits. Even finding coinbase and reading through their learning center can lead you down the wrong path. 

There is just so much to comprehend on a fundamental level, then deciphering what is a quality crypto and why? The space is so polarized. For someone brand new, how quick would they learn the differences between ETH and BTC or XRP for that matter, or literally any other crypto. What's the chances of them learning about LSDs or even the basics of Defi? Where is the drop off on the learning curve for most people? 

Thinking about if I was brand new, jumping into "crypto" today, what would be the most helpful thing for me to learn and understand.. and how would I find it? 

Off the top of my head, personally, I would like a flow chart. Something that could help me visualize the crypto space. Maybe a few versions of the flowchart, basic, intermediate, advanced .. clickable keywords that give a popup of basic definitions. 

How would I find it? Idk, maybe this is where the Maverick funds do some SEO and try to find it's way on the first page of Google.

Some thoughts on winning 

When I was a student, online poker became popular. By chance (I don't even remember how) I found an online poker school that handed out 50$ for free after passing a quiz. I started playing Fixed Limit on the low low stakes (well, because 50$ isn't a lot) but learned a lot, became better, moved up. When I reached 5/10$ (still in FL), I couldn't handle the daily swings anymore. After all I was still a student, had like 750$ a month for everything from rent to food to cloths to drinks. So being in a position of losing 1000$+ on any given day, basically within 30 mins was too much for me. I played 3/6$ for a long time, switched to NL at some point and made it to NL200 games, but felt uncomfy again. I think I was a decent player (but nowhere near the best players on the high stakes) and could have moved higher with my bankroll and skill, but never did. I met a lot of high stakes players that made a lot of money (e.g. I am pretty sure I talked to Hasu a few times). A lot of friends made a lot of money just playing mid stakes, not even grinding nose bleeds. Later I lost interest, because I started working and didn't want to grind at day and night. 

As my second job, I joined a startup rather early, just after they had secured the first significant funding. The startup had created a new product, which turned out to be very successful, used the funding to do performance marketing and within 3 years, the company grew from basically 100 to 1000 FTE. A lot of "high profile" people were hired, earning a lot more than I did, despite being assholes, not being a cultural fit and also not delivering any meaningful results. But they were great politically, knew what to say, when to say it and how to impress the (also rather young) founders. I was living the culture, delivering, but earned like 50% and hated everything about the bullshit bingo guys. 

When a very good friend of mine quit his job, he still had some free time before his new gig started and he asked me what to do with it. That was at the end of 2017/ beginning of 2018. I said "there's this crypto thingy, seems to be interesting, maybe dive it?". We decided to invest 1000$ together. I was still very risk averse and didn't feel comfortable putting money into something that went up and down so fast, so I was happy we did it together. We bought the literal top in January 2018. Got like 0.7X ETH on a Friday, which made +100$ until Saturday. I still remember the euphoria, that day marked the literal pico top of the cycle. I learned a lot, eventually started living on-chain, but never really participated in farming, cause I still dislike spending ETH for tx I don't really need to do for a potential airdrop I might or might not receive. I did receive a lot of airdrops, but I am also pretty sure that compared to others here, my airdrops are tiny. 

Also I had a neteller credit card connected to my Amazon account and basically ordered stuff for free as a student and bought a new (small) car just after finishing university, because I had made 50k in online poker. 

While I was "only" earning 50% of the supposedly high flyers, my salary 2,5xed within 3 years and I had way more money than I needed (and you are probably aware by now, that spending / investing money is not a strength). I also started as a senior role, but at one point managed 150 people and three departments. 

While I probably should have invested more, invested earlier, farmed more and should have way more ETH than I have now, I have received a decent amount or airdrops that are a huge boost to my portfolio. More importantly, I have learned a lot, about investing, finance, how poorly I invested before, how many basic concepts I didn't fully understand and how important it is to make conscious financial decisions. 

Don't compare yourself to the guys that make more money in poker, at work or in crypto. Compare yourself to the guy in the mirror that wouldn't have played poker, wasn't lucky to join a growing startup that allowed you to grow a lot in a short amount of time (both financially, but also when it comes to responsibilities and hence your CV), or wouldn't have invested in crypto because that friend you needed would have said "no". 

If there is one thing that I have learned it's that comparing usually won't help you. It usually doesn't motivate. It actually kills motivation. It gives you a hard time emotionally. Don't compare yourself to the guy on twitter that brags with that 7digit PnL. Don't blame yourself for not receiving the next airdrop on 5 wallets instead of one. 

Comparing doesn't make sense, because your risk appetite is unique. If you accept that you are defined by who/ how you are, you will be able to accept outcomes way better. We can't expect to make millions if we don't invest a lot (of time, money, ETH). And that's okay! 

Celebrate that one airdrop like it was the lottery. Be happy about your first ETH like it was worth a million. Don't try to be/ act different then you truly are. And you'll be winning!

Sold my ETH for a 2020 Honda yesterday. I‚Äôm out of crypto entirely now (gladly). I know the used car market has been hot the past year but I‚Äôm betting it has some room to run. IF I buy into crypto again (with my used car profits)  it‚Äôll be a basket of sub 1000 MC coins with 100x potential and some SOL/AVAX for stability (they‚Äôre the new BTC). I‚Äôll be fine with a 10x tho. Regardless Eth is done imo and everyone here is wasting their time. Advice (not financial) get out before the inevitable epic crash and buy something with more upside. Aside from used cats, garbage pail kids (first edition only with stickers intact) are looking strong. 

EDIT: meant to say used cars in that last sentence, but used cats also have more potential than ETH so not gonna correct.

EDIT2: meant this whole post is a joke. Bad timing I know but hoping to lighten the mood a bit

<summary>u/benido2030 has found 2023 to be their favourite year in crypto</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18i1xpa/daily_general_discussion_december_14_2023/kdcy6uu/)

I am tired. Hyped, cause I believe 2024 will be a good year, but more tired now that it‚Äôs still 2023. I think that‚Äôs partly the bear market which is exhausting, because I promised myself to learn a lot and pay attention to benefit during the bull market. But probably also just psychology cause the year is coming to an end and humans are strange. It‚Äôs an arbitrary date, but still it feels significant, I guess also because of the holidays. In any case this year was my favourite year in crypto. I have learned a lot, developed new interests (eg for the importance and details of governance) and the past 12 months made me feel like home in ETHfinance. I love this community since I joined (2019 or beginning of 2020, don‚Äôt remember) but somehow 2023 was special and I would like to thank all of you! 

That being said I‚Äôll post less for the next 2 weeks I guess, but I‚Äôll stick around, will read and will be back in 2024. love you all!

<summary>u/hanniabu defines some terms which some people seem to be confusing</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18i1xpa/daily_general_discussion_december_14_2023/kdetb5y/)

There seems to be some confusion around terminology. Maybe the terms have been diluted from when I learned them, but this is how I'd define these terms:

* **Hardware wallet** \- This does not mean cold wallet. It means it's not a software wallet and uses hardware to contain your key and do signing.
* **Hot wallet** \- This is a wallet you're actively using. It should not be where your primary funds are stored since there's a higher risk of losing funds. It can be a hardware wallet, it does not (and I'd recommend should not) be a software wallet.
* **Cold wallet** \- This is where you'd store a larger portion of your funds. You don't use this with apps. The goal is as minimal exposure as possible. This should definitely be a hardware wallet.
* **Cold storage** \- This used to be the same as a cold wallet but I see the meanings have diverged. This would be a hardware wallet that is completely airgapped and only has incoming transactions. This is meant for maximum security for long term funds that you don't plan on touching for years.

<summary>u/haurog explains parallel execution on Solana and some criticisms of its consensus mechanism</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18i1xpa/daily_general_discussion_december_14_2023/kdc3n2k/)

In my understanding the solana parallelism relies on the transaction submitter to tell them what contracts/states they touch. It is assumed that they are honest. The attack vector on the paralellisation then goes like this. Just tell the SVM you are touching all AMM contracts, even if you do pretty much nothing in your transaction. The SVM then cannot process the other AMM swaps in parallel, but has to wait until it has processed yours before it can do the other swaps. You force it in doing at least one step serial. Transactions are cheap, so nothing stoping you spamming the network reserving resources left and right. I do not think one can bring Solana down with such an attack, but it would slow down the SVM quite a bit. 

If you want to learn about some real issues with solana in the consensus mechanism they use, there is a recent conference paper by the distributed computing group at the ETH, a university, in Switzerland: <https://tik-db.ee.ethz.ch/file/9d40dad802dd12d9ba1f1b7c1759920c/>

I only skimmed over it, but here are some juicy bits: 

- These tests seem to confirm our basic understanding that Solana does not fully achieve consensus. In this paper we show how a single malicious validator, once elected as leader, might be able to halt the Solana blockchain.
- We also observe some inconsistent behavior, which is not readily explained by any of the consensus rules we are aware of.
- In many places it was hard for us to bring differences between the whitepaper, documentation, and code together into a coherent picture. 
- Solana takes a non-standard approach to achieving state replication in view of possible (adversarial) failures, making strong assumptions about the failure cases that can arise in practice, that seem to go far beyond the normal theoretical bounds for these problems.

App devs might want to develop on SVM for its speed, but to be honest, there are not that many dApps on Solana, so it seems to be difficult to find dApp devs. They had quite some incentives in 2021 I think to onboard people, but it was a limited success as far as I remember. Maybe now with the renewed speculation they might attract more settlers, but we will see what happens. I guess generally Ethereum people are interested in Solanas tech, because they implemented things which need to be solved on the Ethereum side as well. In my opinion, parallelization is not the bottleneck on Ethereums side just yet, it is probably more important for L2s. The Bottleneck is rather the state size and how it is stored/accessed which needs to be solved before one can reap benefits from a fully parallelized EVM. And I am not aware that Solana has solved that issue, but as always I could be very wrong there.

<summary>u/SpontaneousDream has a Coinbase vs the SEC update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18itav8/daily_general_discussion_december_15_2023/kdjv9cx/)

Surprised there isn't more talk about the SEC decision today against Coinbase's petition. This is over a year in the making. Essentially, they are going against Coinbase's view that:

> "the Petition‚Äôs assertion that application of existing securities statutes and regulations to crypto asset securities, issuers of those securities, and intermediaries in the trading, settlement, and custody of those securities is unworkable

[Official SEC release.](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/petitions/2023/4-789-letter-secretary-grewal-121523.pdf)

[Gensler comments.](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-coinbase-petition-121523)

Coinbase has [appealed](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1735716481541996640) and will be taking them to court. This will probably be the most important court case in crypto's history.

In my mind, when Ethereum held its ICO, it was probably security. IANAL but a brief look at the three prongs of the Howey test makes ETH sound like a security offering back then. BUT, Gensler I believe has said before that something can start out as a security and "become decentralized enough" to become a commodity. Don't quote me on that.

<summary>u/TheHansGruber has a staking node update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18jkos4/daily_general_discussion_december_16_2023/kdm8ppg/)

It's been about two and a half months since the holesky testnet re-launch, and all is quiet on the western front. My several thousand holesky validators are choochin' away with no significant hiccups. Running geth/lighthouse at the moment. Still haven't gotten around to setting a withdrawal address for them. For some reason I started having  a difficult time picking up peers on this machine. Since launch I have been stable at 1round 15 peers, but over the last week that has dropped to 1-2 and sometimes 0 peers. Surprisingly, and this is more of a testament to the design of the network, my average effectiveness hardly dropped at all during this. I remained in the mid to high 80's. 

I did do some changing of my network setup and for a few hours I had the holesky machine connected to both wifi and ethernet...I believe the machine had two IP addresses assigned to it and that may have caused some wires (or em waves?) to cross.

I decided to go ahead and forward the ports associated with the EL/CL applications, something I have not had to do with the rocketpool or solo machines. Both of those machines have 50+ peers running out of the box setups and nothing besides a static IP assigned to them. Anyway, running this setup overnight has brought the machine up to the max specified 50 peers and I foresee no other changes needing to be made as far as networking goes.

The other fun part about all this is that I have finally pulled the trigger on a nice little rackmount setup. Not necessary (by a *longshot*), but a lot of fun for a self-proclaimed computer enthusiast. Over the last couple years I have collected some rackmount equipment that I have come across for free/cheap. UPS' that are being tossed just needed a couple new batteries. Gigabit switches that just need a new SFP adapter, etc. Color coding the patch cables and swapping out USB/HDMI/ethernet keystones to make it all look neat and professional. I made a custom mount for a gas spring arm for a monitor on the back of it. There are these cool 1U flip up monitors you can buy that are like 700 quatloos ....yeah....nah....I'll use my free, collecting dust in a corner monitor instead. I have discovered that any normal computer component becomes 10x more expensive if it has "enterprise" or "rackmount" in the name. 

 I am trying to convince another local ISP that I am a business so they will install a fiber line directly to me. My understanding is that the install would be free, and the monthly cost would be more than what I am paying now, but not wholly unreasonable considering how much time and bandwidth I use. I have been close to picking up a dream machine pro because of the sale ubiquiti has had on it...apparently they never do discounts...but after perusing through the rest of their hardware if I fall down that rabbit hole it'll take eth breaking 100K before I can pay off the credit card bill. They've got some good lookin' hardware. That said...if I am a *business*, then that can all be written off...so less taxes...and there I go talking myself into it again. I'll stop now.

The nodeset machine is up and running as well, just waiting to be assigned. I am looking forward to that launch next year. There's a lot to look forward to, and a lot of good work being done combat the biggest threat to ethereum's credible neutrality. It should remain on everyone's mind that the priority needs to be the health of the network. *Any* entity that approaches 33% is a threat to credible neutrality. Doubly so for an entity that *says out loud* that they do not care and will continue to grow in an attempt to harm the network in pursuit of greater profit. 

Just so everyone is clear: **there is no debate about this**. Let us keep fighting the good fight, less we lose the greatest value prop of ethereum. 

I'll keep the staking machines running. Sip some coffee. Get my steps in. Enjoy the beginnings of the bull and patiently await new ATH's. Post here, and occasionally degen 100x some coins *no one* should touch with a ten foot pole. You know...for fun. Because if we don't remember to *have fun* doing all these frontier-of-the-internet shenanigans...what's the point?

<summary>u/stablecoin discusses the difference between high and low conviction investors</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18kamvf/daily_general_discussion_december_17_2023/kdr5esz/)

weak conviction endlessly follows price pumps, strong conviction requires years of building on ideas and integrating within the ecosystem to deliver on the promise of decentralized uncensorable monetary system that any entity can build on.

there's a difference and some of you don't seem to understand. for example is retail going to deposit directly into CRV pools or is retail going to use an app that pays their transaction and draws liquidity from the CRV pools in the background? stop worshiping retail pumps like they mean anything other than CT rotations and drummed up VC exit liquidity. 

FTX estate recently announced they are giving people cash equivalent of crypto when Bitcoin was at 16K prices, and keeping the rest (ie spread between 16K and 42K). guess who also happens to have a lot of SOL to pay back their estate in such a generous way? strange how it all works out huh?

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18l1qbj/daily_general_discussion_december_18_2023/kdygq35/)

BloXroute [have announced](https://x.com/bloXrouteLabs/status/1736819783520092357?s=20) that they are no longer accepting block submissions from builders that contain any transactions that interact with OFAC-sanctioned addresses. For now they've enabled their OFAC checks on their max profit relay, but obviously this makes it kind of the same as their regulated relay and at some point we'll see them merge into one.

BloXroute's max profit relay currently has an inclusion rate (market share? it's complicated) of ~20%. Turning it into a censoring relay doesn't mean 20% more overall Ethereum blocks are going to be censoring. It's more likely that the remaining non-censoring relays will still deliver those blocks, and the impact on Ethereum will be minimal. But clearly this is a trend in the *wrong* direction for network health.

P.S. reminder that censorship at the *builder* level is [a much bigger concern](https://censorship.pics/) than censorship at the relay level right now.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard discusses the concept of useful proof of work</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18luu66/daily_general_discussion_december_19_2023/ke2fw3x/)

Have any of you heard of "useful" proof of work? Now I know most of us here are thoroughly in the proof of stake camp for consensus but at the end of the day all our stake is doing is serving as a basis for Sybil resistance so a bunch of nodes can vote on what the truth is. At the end of the day it's just majority rules. Ethereum solves Sybil resistance by making participants proof they have something. Bitcoin solves Sybil resistance by making participants prove they spent something. That's obviously quite wasteful if you spent that something while getting nothing but Sybil resistance in return but what if the work produced something of inherent value?

The most famous form of proof of work is hashing. However, the nature of the work can take many forms so long as the task meets a few basic requirements.

* There needs to be an unlimited supply of whatever task. You can't be halting your consensus mechanism while waiting for work to arrive.

* The work needs to be verifiable in much less time than it can be done. This is O(c) for hashing but it could be some reasonably small O(n) while still being viable.

So, are there any other "infinite" demand tasks exist with a statistically verifiable outcome? At least one important one is AI training. At least for certain types of AI you're basically just tuning an extraordinarily large array of numbers. That tuning works like a search that takes place over *many* iterations. Each iteration outputs a vector in that space which is basically your proof of work. In a large enough search space, guessing the right direction is basically impossible. So, to get a coherent direction consistently you need to actually do the training work. This is basically the insight of [GenSyn](https://www.gensyn.ai/).

So, now you spend electricity and rather than getting BTC which is just a proof of spend, you get ownership over the model you helped train. Once you have Sybil resistance through this means you can pile on an EVM, SVM, or whatever you like on top of it. Think of it as swapping out *just* the consensus client. People do work and prove they are real, real people just vote on the truth of the state machine. Majority still rules.

There are some potential advantages here to decentralization. PoS at least has a cost of the time cost of the capital that is parked there. Useful PoW might have actually no cost if the economic value of what is produced by the work is greater than the spend required to produce it. Also, anyone with a graphics card powerful enough to iterate on the model can participate without having to hold $64k in ETH. The waste of the system is reduced to the verification time on all participants. That can be offset by the transaction costs of the network being secured.

I just thought it was an interesting line of thought worth sharing. There are forms of work outside of AI but this is one that I came across in my consulting work. Also BitTensor had a [pretty good primer](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/feature/consensus-readme/docs/consensus.md) on the ecosystem of PoW systems if you want to get your head out of the Ethereum ecosystem for a minute.

<summary>u/696_eth compares all of the major chains</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18mnig7/daily_general_discussion_december_20_2023/ke9a5sw/)

What's good bearfinance. Since I stopped being a decentralization maxi I got to be more free and open minded and explore many other chains, here's my quick summary.

> SOL.

Pros: good fees. Phantom wallet is way better than Metamask and any wallet for any other chain that I've experienced. You can still enjoy the defi, NFTs, etc but for low prices so it's more appealing to masses. All of that is good until you hit their main concern, so let's get into cons.

Cons: when needed aka when demand comes in the shit doesnt work but even w/o that half of the time my TXs on dexes don't go thru. I'm assuming when there would be even more demand in the bull run the chain would stop or half of the shit wouldnt work. So yes, the fees are low but the chain doesn't work. It doesn't make me feel secure to hold more than a few $k on the chain and I'm sure real world whales wouldn't want the chain to stop at any time either. 

> AVAX.

I might've gotten to degen there in the wrong time but the fees WERE INSANE. I paid more than Ethereum fees for prices. I don't know what their adv is and I don't care, the experience sucks. Oh, and I also have gotten my TX's failing for unknown reasons while still losing like $10-20 on trying to swap..

> Cardano.

Cardano is a poor man's Solana. Basically all the same shit except it's even worse. Fees are not as low neither. Sometimes the chain just stops, oh well. People say you wait 1-2 days and try again lmao. 

> Osmosis (or whatever its called)

I didn't have a bad experience but I haven't done much there. I've already ran into a few hiccups and I'm assuming there would be more if I explore. Also, it's also probably working ok cause not much demand and again I think that will change when there's lots of demand.

> BSC

I guess it works but the emphasis on the 'guess'. Cheap fees but yeah idk. 

> Bitcoin

30-40min blocks, insane gas fees ($40-50) per tx, no good fucking wallet cause they have their lightning and other ones and there's taproot and some other shit and it's all over the place and I need 3 wallets but then I can't send from different parameters aka lightning, taproot, to each other. Doing NFTs there is a fucking joke, let me tell ya, but free money is free money.

---

Out of all of these, honestly, SOL is probably the best experience for a normie user. You don't have to have much money and it generally works relatively well until it doesn't. Bitcoin has the opposite issue, works poorly awful but it ain't gonna stop. 

---

> ETH L2s

Linea: fees are like mainnet at 30 gwei, wtf is that?

Scroll: fees not too bad but could be better. 

Arb1: somewhat better than scroll.

OP, Base: almost 0 fees and quick confirmations. love it!

Zksync: pretty good fees tbh compared to zkrollups and arb1 but high compared to OP stack. 

Polygon ZkEVM: similar to zksync I'd say.

Arbitrum nova: similar to OP w almost negligible fees but idk who uses it.

Gnosis scan: similar to Arb nova.

Starknet: fragmented out of Ethereum's ecosystem, getting there felt worse than to an alt L1, fees are higher and Linea doesnt look that awful with the Starknets presence.

Polygon PoS (sidechain): actually has an ecosystem, fees more similar to Arb1 & zksync when there's more demand and activity, but usually it's a few times cheaper. You gotta have matic to use it tho so that's a downside. 

> ETH. 

Secure. The fees are kinda high, they are ok but def not for the normies. When the demand spikes up and when more demand comes back it is def going to be only for whales or for degens. The chain never stops tho. Gas wars exist but chain works perfectly. Idk, not really much to say, things seem obvious to me. There's hella liquidity too, there are options like defi that let me do things that I wouldn't do on the other closest chain by security - Bitcoin, and then compared to that the block times are magnitudes of order faster. ETH definitely wins for me as a settlement layer and makes me feel comfy holding assets there. 

---

Will I still use other chains? Probably. 

If I can make free money - sign me up! 

Will I still airdrop farm them? Hell yeah, duh?! 

Will I store there a significant amount of money? Hell naw, sometimes I'm withdrawing from them faster to my CEX and holding it there cause I trust Kraken more.

That said, I'm looking excited for zkrollups after 4844 upgrade and just looking forward to a more mature ecosystem of Ethereum where scalability is solved thru L2s without compromising the security and decentralization of the settlement layer. Also, we badly new a way better wallet and for front ends to be a nicer experience and at least handle the capacity of the users that Ethereum is gong to attract.

---

Lastly, I'll leave you with this.

Decentralization is undervalued until it doesn't.

<summary>u/haurog looks into Solana's decentralisation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18mnig7/daily_general_discussion_december_20_2023/ke5k1w2/)

The discussion in here has gotten a bit out of hand while I was asleep. The ETH sentiment seems to have reached a breaking point, at least for some people. Looks to me like the concentrated marketing and FUD campaigns seems to bear fruit on some. Not surprising, but still sad to see. Someone mentioned Solana nodes, so I share something I realized in a discussion I had on farcaster DMs this week:

Solana has close to 3000 nodes. We do not know how independent they are, but someone asked an interesting question a few days ago: ['Why does solana have over 10% of its validators in Ogden (Utah)'](https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/18f6sdd/why_does_solana_have_over_10_of_its_validators_in/). It was also mention here in ethfinance, but I cannot find the comment anymore.

When you check the [solana decentralization statistics](https://solanacompass.com/statistics/decentralization) today. Ogden 'only' has 133 nodes (5%), but Wichita (Kansas) has 375 (13%). By the way, the Bar chart on the right side still shows Ogden as having ~~293~~  231 servers, yesterday it was 304 (or so). So it seems slightly delayed. 

If you click on 'staked nodes', which are nodes that are also validating, solana has close to 2000. Do not ask me why there are more staking nodes than actual nodes in some locations. Maybe these numbers are filtered in a certain way. Maybe the numbers are just delayed and fast relocations of the nodes gives these weird results. I do not know. 123 of the staking nodes are in Ogden (6%). The bar chart to the right still has Ogden listed with 314 (16%). But now, Wichita seems to have 492 of them, which is a staggering 25% of all solana staking nodes. This in itself is not a healthy number being in one location. What I think is even worse is that it looks like hundreds of nodes have been moved from one location to another within days. 

I would interpret that as a single entity has control over a large part of these nodes/validators and moves them around at a whim. It definitely is very fishy. Much decentralization...

Tiny tid bit of random but potentially interesting information‚Ä¶ (emphasis on the potentially) 

I spoke to a pension adviser recently, while discussing my assets/plans he assumed that I‚Äôd need to sell my ETH to pay for various things. He was blown away at the prospect of permissionless borrowing and even more so at what‚Äôs possible with Alchemix. 

He was neutral on crypto in general and had a basic understanding of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He asked me to explain Ethereum in a way that he might not have heard before and I said something like ‚Äòa credibly neutral digital settlement layer‚Äô. That totally clicked with him. He said that because media/people always focus on the assets themselves, he hadn‚Äôt twigged that the asset are valuable because the networks are valuable. 

It was a brief but really enjoyable chat about what the technology is and what it enables. He asked me to send some links to defi projects as examples for what can be done using Ethereum. I might have just nudged him down the rabbit hole that we‚Äôve all been down, I hope so.

<summary>u/OkDragonfruit1929 shares an overlooked threat to cryptographic systems</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18dg7y9/daily_general_discussion_december_8_2023/kck1xp9/)

Most of the discussion around blockchain encryption algorithm security has shifted to concerns around advances in Quantum Computing, however, I fear there is another, less sexy and therefore less popular, but far more dangerous  risk lurking in the shadows.

Most encryption protocols that are no longer used weren't "cracked" by brute forcing, but rather, a fatal flaw or new mathematical concept was discovered which rendered the necessity to brute force the encryption moot.

There are algorithms that, if the flaw had not been discovered, would otherwise take millions of years to "brute force" in the traditional sense, even with modern advances in GPU performance.

One of the most prominent historical examples of this is the encryption algorithm, RC4.

When RC4 was designed by Ron Rivest in 1987, it was considered secure against brute force attacks even with large key lengths. At the time, there were no known "fatal flaws" in the RC4 algorithm itself that would enable shortcuts to finding the encryption key.

However, over time, cryptographers discovered vulnerabilities in RC4 that completely broke the algorithm:

* In 2001, Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir found that RC4 has significant biases in its first few bytes of output. This allowed efficient attacks on RC4 keys.
* By 2013, AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt used these RC4 weaknesses to develop practical attacks that could recover encryption keys in just hours.

RC4 turned out to have latent mathematical vulnerabilities unknown when it was first introduced. When discovered and properly exploited, these flaws made brute forcing irrelevant - the keys could be recovered much more quickly by exploiting previously undiscovered flaws.

If those flaws had not been uncovered, even with the advanced computing power we have today, untreated RC4 encryption, like Keccak-256, the hashing algorithm used to secure Ethereum, would have otherwise taken millions of years to brute force.

As AI continues to advance, especially in areas like mathematics and cryptography, it raises the risk of AI systems potentially finding vulnerabilities in existing cryptographic primitives that human experts have missed.

An AI system that has been specifically trained in cryptography, number theory, abstract algebra etc... could potentially have capabilities beyond any individual human cryptanalyst. If focused on analyzing something like Keccak-256, the hashing algorithm usedto secure ethereum, it might conceivably find a mathematical weakness.

For the time being, human ingenuity and intuition still often exceeds AI systems, especially in creative realms like developing new cryptographic attack techniques. So I wouldn't count on AI finding and exploiting flaws in encryption protocols right away within the next year or so.

Leading cryptographers do already actively think about AI safety and robustness in cryptography, so defenses are being developed with AI systems in mind. Things like quantum-resistant cryptography, algorithmic randomness testing, and cryptographic verifiability provide technical means to verify security assumptions even in the face of advanced AI.

However, due to innate biases in human researchers, we may have likely overstated the capabilities of human ingenuity compared to rapidly advancing AI systems. There are a few reasons why AI may surpass humans in cryptanalysis creativity and intuition in the not-so-distant future (perhaps 3-5 years):

* Scale - AI systems can ingest and deeply analyze orders of magnitude more cryptography research, mathematical concepts, etc... than any individual or team of humans. This massive scale of analysis may uncover connections no human would find.
* Lack of biases - Unlike humans, AI systems do not have intrinsic biases or prejudgments that might limit their creativity in finding new attack vectors. They may connect conceptual dots in unconventional ways.
* Recursive self-improvement - As AI becomes more skilled at cryptography and cryptanalysis, it can recursively optimize and enhance these skills, with no human learning limits.
* Combination of methods - AI can combine mathematical, side-channel, malware-based, and other cryptographic attacks in creative frameworks beyond predictable human designs.
* Evaluation of small flaws - An AI can patiently evaluate minor weaknesses in cryptosystems that humans may dismiss, and find ways to exploit combinations of these non-obvious flaws.

The historical compromise of once-secure encryption algorithms like RC4 demonstrates the risks posed by mathematical and cryptanalytic advances. Latent flaws can lurk for years before discoveries in codebreaking render brute force attacks unnecessary. As AI systems continue rapid improvement in areas like cryptography, they may have the scale, lack of bias, and creativity needed to surface new flaws in encryption primitives required for blockchains to remain secure.

<summary>u/pa7x1 explains what we seem to have forgotten about previous cycles and what really matters in the bigger picture</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18e6xji/daily_general_discussion_december_9_2023/kcn3rgy/)

I think people forget easily the despair they felt on other occasions. Can't even count with the fingers in both hands how many times people were giving up on Ethereum because of Solana, Tezos, EOS, Cardano, Ripple (it was the second biggest coin back 2017ish), Litecoin, Polkadot, Avalanche, BSC, Nano, Algorand, Tron, Iota, and of course Bitcoin. But if you zoom out the trend is clear, the previous challengers tend to irrelevance. Ethereum keeps crawling upwards towards the biggest market cap. The local minima that it sets with respect to Bitcoin keeps going up. 

And it has wiped out the floor in terms of adoption metrics that can't be manipulated with respect to everything else. You should never pay any attention to metrics that can be pumped up at no cost. # active addresses means nothing, they are created for free and this can be automated without any human intervention. It means nothing. Don't care either about # transactions per se as an adoption metric. These are digitized systems, machines can generate transactions at insane speeds. A transaction here does not necessarily represent economic activity or a change of goods. In the same way moving coins from my left pocket to my right pocket doesn't constitute economic activity nor bumps GDP numbers. The way you track economic activity in the real world is through VAT (value added tax), the moment someone pays a tax to participate in an economic exchange is the moment you can be pretty damn sure whoever participated in that exchange was willing to do so because it generated value added. The network fees are this type of non-fakeable metric. This is a very real cost to whoever participated in an economic exchange. Guess what, Ethereum wipes the floor. Solana does a measly 100K USD on a good day, Ethereum does 100x that, 10M USD.

Here lies the problem, if you are going to sell a very cheap good with low profit margins. You better sell a lot of it, to make up for it in volume. Solana transactions are very cheap so it generates a lot of potential demand for transactions, but even being this cheap they cannot sell enough to make up for it in volume. Solana would need to scale by x100 from 500 tps to 50000 tps keeping current transaction fees to challenge Ethereum. Or increase transactions fees by 100x, in which case we will see how many of those low value transactions remain on the chain. Or anything in between that makes up for the 100x.

The TVL onchain, which is a bit more gameable than the fees but still can be used as a proxy, is pitiful. There are 900M USD onchain on Solana. That's not even 1 whale. Ethereum has 30 billion USD just on the L1, and another 16 billion USD on the L2s. All these Solana activity you see on Twitter is most likely completely fake, paid out by VCs or the Solana foundation. Or completely irrelevant users with barely any skin in the game.

<https://defillama.com/compare?chains=Ethereum&chains=Solana&chains=Tezos&chains=Tron&chains=Bitcoin&chains=Cardano&tvl=false&volume=false&fees=true&revenue=false&addresses=false&txs=false>

Remove the noise, focus on what matters.

It's time to address the elephant in the room. It's time to admit that The Ratio¬© is the worst unit of measure since Fahrenheit. 

The flippening is all about ETH market cap overtaking BTC market cap. So, then, why is the Ratio metric comparing price/price instead of market cap / market cap?

The flippening target, on the Ratio, currently stands at 0.16275. Does anyone know that off the top of their head?  Is it a nice round number that's easy to communicate?

The flippening target is a moving target that changes literally every second. Moving targets are absolutely garbage in the business world. 

BTC and ETH supply are constantly changing. Thus, a Ratio of 0.05 today is different from a Ratio of 0.05 last month. In fact, a Ratio that stays flat moves us further and further from a flippening, due to ETH's shrinking supply. 

Because the Ratio means different things at different times, based on changing supply, graphs of the Ratio over time are misleading. Any TA performed on those charts is wrong.  There would need to be inflation adjusted Ratio charts. 

Now the alternative:

A market cap / market cap ratio solves all of this. 

No moving target. The flippening target is always 1.00 and always will be. 

It's an easy to remember target and easy to communicate. 

It is unaffected by changes in BTC and ETH supply. 

The market cap ratio currently sits at 0.33. That tells you exactly what you need to know without any further information. The price of ETH needs to triple to flip BTC. Easy. 

The Ratio currently sits at 0.05365.  Quick, what does ETH need to do to flip BTC?  Better pull up a computer. Because this Ratio tells you literally nothing. 

Please, I beg this community to abandon the Ratio. Join me in welcoming the Market Cap Ratio. Think of me as Anders Celsius, introducing a sane metric that's easier to use and understand.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade explains the difference in marketing for industry competitors vs industry leaders</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18ewx8m/daily_general_discussion_december_10_2023/kcs8az3/)

It's a common business strategy to go after your competitors' market shares, because their customers already know the product category, have demonstrated a need for it, and have already been willing to spend for it in the past. Cost per customer acquisition tends to be lower.

But this strategy is only viable if you're a challenger.

The leader of a niche usually has to market not only its own product, but the entire product category as well. The leader has to grow the market itself.

Recently Coinbase has taken the approach of a leader:

\- The recent [announcement of a new feature for sending and receiving usdc for free through Coinbase wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/with-coinbase-wallet-sending-money-is-now-as-easy-as-sending-a-text) has the potential to be a game changer for adoption.

\- The legal battles Coinbase is fighting really do seem to aim at making the situation better for all players, and bringing the fight to public attention through transparency not only ridicules the opponents (the SEC) but also shows alignment with a crypto core value.

\- The "[update the system](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1730633199087161813)" short videos aren't centered around crypto users pain point specifically, they're targeting the general population.

Coinbase bets on its (non custodial) wallet. Coinbase bets on Ethereum L2s and by having its own, Base. Coinbase clearly sees in Ethereum what we all see in it, they see the future.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi has an ARB delegate update.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18fnqr1/daily_general_discussion_december_11_2023/kcwp1z0/)

Recent ARB vote updates:
  


A vote to [Incentivize the "Rage Trade" platform](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe968af3f6b06d386958e513c2285f72f7172aabd2661311a485270bab3b1c7db) was fairly unanimously voted down, with a 'No' vote from myself. This result was pretty expected, as the general consensus was this would better fit within the defined STIP framework.

The [Security & Audit Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb) passed, moving forward work on setting up a comprehensive request for proposal process for selection of auditors & security-based service providers. I voted 'Yes', as I am largely in favor of having service providing decisions be handled as uniformly as possible. The Rage Trade request above is an example of this, where it's just easier to have frameworks instead of individual requests. 

[ArbOS Version 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa635e39a2c527f7a1eabf5ea22bdec6f4a265d6c69a06076e65fde0ae0a5941b) passed. For those interested, might be best to click the link. A lot of Github PRs to read! I voted Yes, as it felt like a formality more than anything. 

I voted 'Yes' to [extend the timeline for STIP & Backfund STIP funding](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a0a7bee0c5b13a690275031c44d8b5efe78b86d86f6d2357299020e7a907d57). In short, longer than expected KYC approval times were really shortening the window grants could payout their ARB. Felt fair to approve this, given how relatively messy the whole process was. Grants that were looking to incentive users may suffer from only being able to provide ARB during a super-short window. 

The Tally vote to [backpay early Arbitrum community contributors](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/107148500545417261921864085816276971795902152093375547084153298266650813470763?chart=2) has failed. I did vote Yes for this, but it seems most the No voting came from a place of general approval, but not comfortable with the specific implementation of it. With what seems like broad support for the basic idea, I'll be curious if a re-worked proposal will come from this. 

Currently active is a vote for an [experimental trail period of paying active ARB Delegates](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740). I did vote Yes, as I generally am for paying for crypto work where it feels appropriate. There are a lot of metrics that will (hopefully) incentive active DAO participation from delegates. I do wish a larger size of delegates were being paid... I pushed for this, and it was increased from 30 to 50, but would have rather seen more to entice more / new delegates. I understand the criteria, and having a cutoff is good for a DAO this size, but it probably could have been increased further. 

This all comes with the caveat that I fully understand what this vote represents - a group of people voting to pay themselves. Not sure if there is ever a good way to handle that, but it the proposer has gone through a lot of revisions from community discussion, so at a minimum it feels to at least not be something thrown together in a hasty attempt at a money grab.

<summary>u/Revanchist1 explains the significance of the FRAX x PayPal partnership</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18fnqr1/daily_general_discussion_december_11_2023/kcxd5ph/)

*tricky told me to repost it since it got flagged by automod. I'll remove the links but try my best to still make sure you can find the source.*

**Fraxchain testnet is Live**

An ETH L2 that will use frxETH as the native token as opposed ot native ETH. Due to the dual nature of their staked ETH model, the more frxETH that is not staked means increased APR for their staked ETH derivative - sfrxETH.

Also a portion of transaction fees on Fraxchain will be sent to veFXS holders as rewards.

Afterwards Frax aims to launch their frxBTC product afterwards. I'm really interested in how Frax will keep the BTC peg while still being decentralized, like they claim.

From Sam:

> Launch frxBTC after Fraxchain so that Frax Finance also issues a BTC-pegged stablecoin everywhere else outside of the Bitcoin blockchain and starts accumulating monetary premium in DeFi. 

In my opinion, the best part of the FRAX ecosystem is that Frax is their biggest customer. They build products that Frax will use and benefit from. Similar to Amazon and AWS, turning their biggest expense into their greatest earners.
    
       
**FRAX and PayPal Collaboration.** 

I find it interesting to see a US company partake in the CRV wars and DeFi as a whole. It's incredibly cool to see a partnership forming between TradFi and DeFi. PayPal slowly testing the benefits of liquidity dApps like curve, convex, and Frax. 

Frax received $10million pyUSD from an associated PayPal address and a governance proposal was submitted to Frax.

*FRAX Finance Governance FIP-307*

> **Summary:**
> 
> This proposal seeks to officially whitelist PayPal USD (PYUSD) into the Frax Curve Automated Market Operator (AMO). This action aims to enhance the diversity and utility of the Frax ecosystem by integrating a stablecoin linked to a major financial service provider.
> 
> **Background and Motivations:**
> 
> The inclusion of PYUSD in the Frax Curve AMO will broaden the range of stablecoins within our ecosystem, providing users with more options and enhancing the overall resilience of the platform.
> 
> PayPal is a globally recognized financial services provider. The integration of PYUSD can leverage this reputation, potentially attracting new users who trust PayPal‚Äôs brand and services. The demand for stablecoins continues to grow within the DeFi space. By adding PYUSD, we are meeting this demand and ensuring our platform remains competitive and relevant.

Here's a great $PYUSD blog post I found concerning the levels of safety with regards to customer protections.

*Google "JPKoning PayPal" it should be the first link. Worth the quick read*

*Title: There are now two types of PayPal dollars, and one is better than the other*

> If you listen to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who in response to PayPal's announcement fretted that PayPal's crypto-based dollars would not able to "guarantee consumer protections," you'd assume the traditional non-crypto version is the safer one. And I think that fits with most peoples' preconceptions of crypto.
> 
> Not so, oddly enough. It's the PayPal dollars hosted on crypto databases that are the safer of the two, if not along every dimension, at least in terms of the degree to which customers are protected by: 1) the quality of underlying assets; 2) their seniority (or ranking relative to other creditors); and 3) transparency.
> 
> [PYUSD collateral] must be recorded on two separate days each month, or 24 times per year...these attestation reports must be prepared by an independent auditor. The only way to get vetted financial information about the assets backing traditional PayPal [accounts] is to read its audited financial statements, which come out just once a year. For the rest of the twelve months, customers are left in the dark.
> 
> The fact that one type of PayPal dollar ([PYUSD]) has robust protections while the other is only haphazardly protected, and only because the first is managed with a crypto database and not a traditional database, seems incredibly arbitrary to me."

The entire blog post is worth a read and is relatively short. It's really interesting that the stablecoin regulations have ended up creating a safer asset for customers.

<summary>u/superphiz shares news of a major bug on Binance Smart Chain and what it means for Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/187bfcu/daily_general_discussion_november_30_2023/kbeue2p/)

Binance Smart Chain may have entered a fork condition because of a bug introduced into bsc-geth.

<https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1730239018619613667>

I'd like to draw your attention to what this COULD mean for binance chain, and why it's important for us to learn from it. To be clear, I didn't study the binance incident, I'm taking a general lesson from what MIGHT have happened, and definitely editorializing to hammer the point. Please don't tell me I'm wrong about the incident, I'm applying this to our chain and I don't care about BSC.

It looks like bsc-geth, a majority client on Binance Smart Chain could have introduced a bug that was enshrined in the chain because bsc-geth is a majority client. bsc-erigon has been unable to follow the new canonical bsc chain because it did not accept this bugged version of the bsc chain.

There are two potential corrections:

1. Introduce the same bug into bsc-erigon and make the wrong chain the canonical chain (with minimal disruption in the chain, but maximum social disruption)

2. Undo/Redo/Slash/Roll-back bsc chain to correct the error in the chain and move forward with a correct state, but resulting in devastating chain consequences.

This should be a HUGE red flag to Ethereans that solidifies our concerns about client majorities. If geth introduced a bug into our execution layer we'd be in the exact same predicament. 

How do we prevent it? By using minority clients, EVEN if they're more buggy and/or less performant.

Why? We have about 4.5 execution clients right now: geth, nethermind, besu, erigon, and reth (rust Ethereum). If each of those clients has ~20% - ~25% of the share, ANY one of them could fail or introduce a bug and the network will shit a brick but keep going on the right chain, essentially falling to 75% efficiency until that bug is fixed in that single client.

AS IT STANDS, geth has 84% of the execution chain market share. If geth introduces any bug into the chain, it will become the canonical chain, and the other 3.5 clients representing 16% of the chain will just be ignored. 

THIS is why client diversity on both the execution AND consensus layers is so important. See <https://clientdiversity.org/> for more info.

If you're not familiar with the design principles of Ethereum, one point you should know is that in Ethereum, the spec leads the implementation, the implementation doesn't lead the spec. This can take awhile to understand, but it essentially means that we design the chain carefully, then write code to support that spec; we don't write production code and then try to write documentation explaining what that code does.

<summary>u/eth2353 shares concerns about Coinbase's staking ecosystem</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1884mjc/daily_general_discussion_december_1_2023/kbiyu6u/)

Coinbase announced support for partial ETH staking through the Coinbase Wallet [in their blog](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/customer-stories/cb-wallet) yesterday. While this is great for enabling access to staking yield to more people, in the same blog post they openly admit they only use Geth as their execution client (not sure if they ever confirmed it like this before, but everyone kind of knew). As the largest single staking entity (running around 15% of staked ETH) this is incredibly irresponsible behavior and they should be called out for it. I believe it is at this point in time a bigger issue than Lido having about 30%.

If you have your ETH staked with Coinbase, move to a better alternative for the network (e.g. Rocket Pool / StakeWise V3 / ...). Reach out to Coinbase if you're a customer. They have had so much time to improve their operations yet chose not to so far.

I think Coinbase is doing great things for the crypto ecosystem in general, especially in the US, but this is something that just *needs* to be improved and there is no excuse not to. They could almost single-handedly lower Geth's dominance to a point where it's a non-issue. It is currently believed to be around 80-85%, take away Coinbase's 15% and we're almost below 66% which is the bare minimum we need to reach to be safe from supermajority bugs.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1884mjc/daily_general_discussion_december_1_2023/kblim2u/)

Pretty big week for the Genesis(/Gemini Earn) bankruptcy, TLDR is that the judge has approved them to move forward with a vote on the recovery plan. If the vote passes in January people will start getting their assets back.

<https://www.gemini.com/earn>

I haven't been able to find any details on the % recovery users should I expect from this deal, expect that to come out in the following weeks.

One thing I'm curious about is the the composition of the assets that are owed, and the composition of the funds Genesis/DCG have on hand to fund this recovery with. Anybody know the breakdown of what assets were tied up in this bankruptcy as far as USD/stables/ETH/BTC?

I'm wondering because there are billions tied up in this bankruptcy and if they had to exchange a significant amount of cash for ETH/BTC that could be meaningful buy pressure in crypto markets. Although I think a significant chunk of what they are providing is GBTC, and I suspect a large proportion of assets owed are USD/stables so I doubt its that big of a deal.

I went hiking at Zion National Park in Utah for the last week. Landed back last night, and woke up to this beautiful pump. I should have known ETH was waiting for someone to be out in nature to pump. [Here are some poorly taken pics.](https://www.imgur.com/a/pxryil5) 

You're welcome. 

First hike we did was the Angels Landing hike, which was surprisingly easy despite all the reviews saying it's one of the harder national park hikes. The Chain section was exciting and was the most fun I've had hiking.

Utah is such a beautiful state and everyone was very kind to us! Will definitely try to visit again to see the other national parks there.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/189n2j6/daily_general_discussion_december_3_2023/kbx1jhn/)

re: "let's just clean up r/ethereum"

It's probably fair to say that I hold a decent bit of soft power in r/ethereum policy, as I'm the longest-tenured moderator who does any modding, plus I literally was 98%+ of all mod actions in 2018-2019 until I added twigwam.  Most of the mods are inactive, even the ones who have been added recently.

As the above may suggest, I care about r/ethereum, even gave an entire EthCC speech on it once upon a time.

i'm also from the time when everyone in Ethereum was angry about r/bitcoin censorship tyranny by Theymos.  Even mild mannered people you might not expect like Phil Daian.  Early Ethereum was quite fervent about free speech on Reddit.

Then came the DAO fork, and I got censored a few times for things not even close to being censor-worthy (in my view) though it was an emotional time for everyone and some temp mods had been added.  I wasn't a mod then.  IMHO the censorship was part of what led to ETC.  We didn't feel heard.

fundamentally r/ethereum is never going to go back to being the way it was.  We don't have the tools necessary, and the deeply technical community will never come back.  Ethfinance exists, and most of y'all prefer to hang out here, rather than there.  Ethereum is magnitudes of magnitudes bigger than when people first started complaining about the quality of r/ethereum declining in 2014.

<summary>u/-DarkKnight shares a lesson they learned the hard way so that you don't have to</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18b5cgi/daily_general_discussion_december_5_2023/kc4sjxv/)

These few weeks when the market has been pumping is making me really sad and anxious...

Here's my story,

I joined 2021 bull, and bought BTC, ETH, and various shitcoins.

Thankfully quite early on in late 2021 I learnt about ETH with the upcoming merge.

Sometime around 2022 I coverted all my positions to ETH, but with the bear I had already lost a considerable amount of money. I then started buying more and at its peak in mid-late 2022 I had managed to save 24 ETH - all my life savings.

Then after the FTX crash I lost more in fiat terms, and I started taking more riskier bets. I tried trading LTFs and lost a lot of ETH. This made me irrational and I started converting ETH to Alts, first sound ones such as RPL, but later as I tried making back what I lost I started taking stupid and risky bets by coverting my stack into shitcoins hoping I can try and get back what I lost. 

This was it, I lost the majority of my stack here. 

This was a very expensive lesson for me not to trade. I dont think I can stomach buying anything ther than ETH now. Now I've started to accumulate with a measly 1.6E so far but the price rise is making accumulation even difficult üò¢

I hope this was a useful lesson to you all as it was for me. Wanted to warn others here not to thread the same part I did as CT and seeing others with huge profits can make you do risky things.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal warns of a potentially widespread vulnerability</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18b5cgi/daily_general_discussion_december_5_2023/kc2xhpq/)

Certain thirdweb contracts deployed before the 20th of November were vulnerable:

<https://blog.thirdweb.com/security-vulnerability/>

thirdweb is a framework for low-code smart contract deployments. I'm not sure how many projects use them, but they're a name that comes up often in the dev spheres. I'd guess the less technical projects are more likely to be users here, NFTs moreso than DeFi.

Building code abstractions in web3 is no small task. The more flexible you make your framework, the more attack vectors. Catastrophic bugs cannot be patched on a whim like in web2.

edit: we might get an idea of the vuln in question, even without being programmers, by checking the common dependencies in the affected contract list. I'd guess it's tied to the ERC2771 upgradeable import, which has something to do with metatransactions. Maybe something allowing an exploiter to pose as a trusted relayer? I would love to understand enough to know.

[u/im_THIS_guy](https://reddit.com/u/im_THIS_guy):

If you think this is bad, the first time BTC hit $44k, back in early 2021, the price of ETH was just $1770. 

BTC had already more than doubled its prior ATH, while ETH was barely above its prior ATH.  

This sub was losing its shit. ETH was dead. Then, things got worse. 6 more weeks of ratio bleed.  The price of ETH dropped 10%! while BTC kept pumping, up 17%.  How incredibly demoralizing. 

Then something interesting happened.  Over the next 6 weeks, BTC was flat and ETH pumped 365%!  Oh my. 

This market will wear you down. You'll want to give up and switch from ETH to something that's pumping. That's when the rocket takes off. I guarantee you plenty of people switched from ETH to BTC right before the ratio popped from 0.3 to 0.8 that spring of 2021.

Honestly if someone has held both then they should understand how more valuable and practical ETH is and the ratio doesn't even phase them much probably altho I'm the one who converted majority of my BTC stack at around 0.067, so yes I'm underwater on that decision, for now but not forever.

**No matter the ratio** my ethereum printrr stil goes brrrr.

**No matter the ratio** I can go ahead and get loans within minutes and get liquidity for IRL without selling my assets and triggering a tax nightmare.

**No matter the ratio** there are 10000, hell probably even way more, different projects and amazing developments that are going in the ecosystem that I can go and explore.

**No matter the ratio** the community has so many interesting topics to talk about between themselves.

**No matter the ratio** there are way more opportunities that exist and show up for me in this ecosystem.

**No matter the ratio** I can get other assets such as NFTs, providing me with an alternative leveraged investment on my position.

**No matter the ratio** I can randomly get hundreds, if not thousands, of $$$ airdropped to me.

**No matter the ratio** I can go ahead and build on top of my assets that live on Ethereum.

**No matter the ratio** Ethereum captures my attention more than Bitcoin ever has.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18bxesk/daily_general_discussion_december_6_2023/kc7kx2x/)

[u/MinimalGravitas](https://reddit.com/u/MinimalGravitas):

Finished with my Optimism RetroPGF ballot, finally! Allocated to a little under 300 projects (out of about 650 that passed through the initial filtering).

Honestly, this was a ludicrous amount of work, and I'm very glad we had such a long time to do it (4 weeks). The process of assesing and evaluating has probably consumed about 40 hours (rather than the 8 estimated at the beginning, lol).

Projects need to get onto 17 ballots to qualify for anything, then will they recieve the median amount from those ballots. To see which projects have got how many ballots so far check out:

<https://www.growthepie.xyz/optimism-retropgf-3>

It's been quite sad to see the amount that some projects have felt forced to shill themselves to badgeholders, and also that it seems to have worked which will encourage more of it in the future. Just one example that I saw was Sonne, a fork of Compound, whose token holders clearly brigaded the OP Discord and now has reached quorum. How is a DeFi lending platform, with a token, a 'Public Good'? I have no idea, but they are far from the only example.

Lefteris has been trying to point out that some of the projects which most quickly reached 17 ballots are things which really don't need an extra injection of funds due to huge amounts of VC funding. 

An example of this that I find particularly egrigious would be Synthetix, who not only received $20M in VC funding this year, but previously received 9M OP... of which they then used about 2M to give themselves a huge amount of governance power...

<https://gov.optimism.io/t/synthetix-ambassadors-phase-0-delegation-2m-op-tokens/3726>

... and then used that voting power to nominate their ambassador as a RetroPGF badgeholder:

<https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x22d4c3ab56832de58c1774d1a0aeb61ba6dde8b16c0f8382f85d8935f3ee1f11>

Synthetix are obviously huge in the Optimism ecosystem, and generate a lot of value... but I wouldn't suggest they are the most worthy recipients of 'public goods' funding. 

Anyway, governance is never perfect, Moloch is always present, and I'm sure we can learn and iterate over time. For now at least, I've done my allocations and so should have a little more time for commenting here again!

Focusing on things that don't necessarily have an influencer for brand awareness - love Carl's "Popular NPM packages" list, added a lot of those. And of course, staking tooling, infra, etc cuz Optimism doesn't exist without Ethereum's validators

Discriminating against things that have been well-known in the ecosystem for years but I can't find significant progress that they've made in the past couple years... I find that some projects coast on reputation

altcoin nostalgia series, part 01: **Oyster Pearl (PRL)**

In this series, I want to take you on a trip through some of the most interesting shitcoins from the past. 

Oyster Pearl wanted to revolutionize online advertising and give website owners an alternative and private way to monetize their content. The idea was that website owners could insert one line of code, and visitors would contribute their spare computing power and storage space to support the protocol. In return, they would earn PRL tokens. The data would be stored on the iota tangle. There was also a second coin called Shell (SHL).

PRL was extremely hyped in 2017. Right before the binance listing, one of the team members did some insider trading. The anonymous founder bruno block wasn't cool with that and rug pulled the whole project, minting and dumping more PRL coins. 

After that, some team members founded Opacity (OPQ) and airdropped tokens to PRL holders, the project also died. Bruno founded a new scammy project called Akoya (AKYE) and airdropped tokens as well. Of course it died. There were some mental health issues involved ($5,000 banana). Apparently, he was caught on a yacht with safes full of gold bars. Amir Bruno Elmaani got 4 years in prison for tax evasion.

Deep dive by Doug Colkitt on the Kyber exploit: <https://twitter.com/0xdoug/status/1727613541115429314>

Careful manipulation to make the pool believe it has more liquidity than it does, then extract real funds through this phantom liquidity.

I don't want to kick anyone while they're down, the Kyber guys are good devs working hard and let's hope for a good resolution. FWIW the hacker has signaled through blockchain messages he would be willing to talk today. <https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7a8912583520304ce2364fa165dafe94461a91ab2dcf45dab942e296594dc40a>

But, musing about security in the abstract... I have to say, I felt for a long while the engineering in Kyber seemed overcomplicated. I once got stuck in one of their farms, and without the team solving it for me, I would have been screwed. This is different from Uniswap or Aave where you can figure out the contracts on your own as an intermediate user.

Complex protocols have greater attack surface.

Sanity checks like 1-block delays on TVL sensitive actions seem like low hanging fruits to avoid catastrophic exploits. Kills flashloan abuse, for starters. 

I get that those are tough calls, how do you implement such edge case checks without hurting genuine composability? But surely there must be some threshold of liquidity past which we have reasonable confidence no legitimate use would occur, because of slippage.

*but* then again, the concentrated liquidity design implies all of the liquidity in one tick can very well be a legitimate swap...

Basic x * y = k as per Uniswap v2 may have been capital inefficient, yet the simplicity was elegant in more ways than one.

I'm glad I don't work on AMMs!

Just wanted to let the good folks in here know StakeWise's V3 launch is just around the corner. The V2-V3 contract migration proposal is live on their governance forum and the snapshot vote has reached quorum with 100% approval for now.

Their V3 architecture brings some big advantages, e.g. solo stakers can create their own (private if they like) vault and mint an LST against it. If you want to get a feel for what it will look like, I suggest you browse through the testnet vaults at [https://testnet.stakewise.io/](https://testnet.stakewise.io/) . 

It took more than a year since their V3 announcement to get to this stage and I'm proud to have contributed in a small way myself as well by adding remote signer support to their operator service.

Even though this post may feel like it, I am not in any way affiliated with StakeWise, I just appreciate all of the work that went into this and I haven't seen this be discussed in recent days. This gives stakers who can't stake at home a lot more choice and will hopefully help keep Lido's power in check.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/183d0jg/daily_general_discussion_november_25_2023/kaq2czp/)

> 1. Does this potentially solve liquidity fragmentation?

Basically it should unlock all possible liquidity on all chains if it integrates CCIP into the protocol functions, Synthetix (SNX) is doing just that for helping to launch sUSD liquidity products on top of Base and Arbitrum I believe. Like many things, protocols need to be built from the ground up or upgraded to support it.

> 2. Does this effectively move the security from ethereum to chainlink? or would it be better to say it moves security from a lot of shitty bridges to chainlink which is arguably an improvement.

It more or less just replaces bridges and the biggest security improvement is you can remove honeypots that are the bridge contracts. No longer do you need to store all the assets into one place, with one potential vulnerability always looming. If you attack the Chainlink feeds/CCIP features it is going to be more like to having to attack all the ETH nodes to get your unsanctioned blockchain instruction in. Chainlink node distribution will help secure bridging as long as the feeds are also proven to be secure.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18441na/daily_general_discussion_november_26_2023/kaukpet/)

Lido are up to fuckery again.

In this twitter post <https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1728680630773575956>, Nero shows how a lido node operator, p2p.org (run by a lido cofounder), has announced it will start waiting to produce blocks. There‚Äôs a function called ‚Äògetheader‚Äô that the block proposer is supposed to call at time = 0, but node operators have until time = 4 seconds to help home operators who might have latency issues. 

By waiting to call that function, they will get up to 4 seconds more of mev into their blocks. 

The impact this will have is they‚Äôll further centralise the ethereum network to orgs who have the ability to still produce blocks while waiting the longest amount of time - home operators or decentralised services would not be able to wait so long because they‚Äôre more likely to fail in block production. People will go to services that give them the best yield in LSTs without thinking about the potential impact on the ethereum network. 

Lido literally have a golden goose in their possession, but they‚Äôre killing it. It‚Äôs extremely shortsighted, and it might have horrendous impacts for the rest of us stakers. 

Please speak out against this!

This incident involved an in-depth comprehension of the underlying code to exploit it ([u/PhiMarHal](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/181udkk/daily_general_discussion_november_23_2023/kaf4z7b/) reported already the technical details). The exploiter displayed a peculiar level of psychopathic behavior, leaving on-chain messages throughout the exploit to explain their actions. The final message they left was:

"Dear Kyberswap Developers, Employees, DAO members and LPs,  
Negotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested.  
Thank you."

KyberSwap chose to extend a 10% bounty to the hacker, with 90% intended for restitution.

What makes this incident even more disturbing is the fact that during the hack, a MEV bot operator was able to capture $5.7 M from Kyber by frontrunning the exploiter.

The deal has now been struck for the return of 90%, with the remaining 10% awarded to the frontrun bot operator ([tweet](https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1728800315955437743)). Morale does not seem to exist in the crypto landscape.

The situation draws parallels to the Euler hack, evoking a sense of d√©j√† vu for those who have experienced similar events. Notably, the exploiter received a message from the origninal Euler Finance Exploiter wallet, shilling some meme coin (I don't link it).

In the midst of difficult circumstances, it is important not to lose hope and to expect the best possible outcome. Christmas is soon. Speaking from the experiance as a victim of the Euler hack myself, navigating the aftermath won't be easy.

I hope those among our community who have been impacted by the Ethfinancier incident can navigate through their losses with resilience ([comments in the daily](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/181udkk/daily_general_discussion_november_23_2023/kaesjlg/)). Resilience and risk management remains a key virtue in the crypto realm. Remember, don't put all your eggs or ETH in one defi protocol.

[u/stablecoin](https://reddit.com/u/stablecoin)'s post today got me thinking about developing an EthFinanceGPT that can answer newcomers' questions, respond to FAQs, dispel FUDs, and overall encapsulate the spirit of EthFinance to provide unbiased guidance. For those of you who don't know, GPTs are specialized tools capable of retrieving facts from an external knowledge base. This allows LLMs to utilize that information to generate answers. They can also follow instructions provided by the creator and have API access, as well as internet access, including an image generation tool.

We have a plethora of content that can serve as the knowledge base, such as the Daily Doots, the EVMavericks Discord, ETF forums, blog posts by prominent users, educational content, discussions on decentralization, tokenomics, technical analysis, Twitter posts, and even memes. A curated knowledge base can be provided to a community-funded GPT, and perhaps even a Reddit bot could be created to interact with this GPT through posts.

Unfortunately, I only have time to read through the dailies, so I won't be able to spearhead this effort. However, if someone else is interested in pursuing this, please feel free to do so.

Welp guys, it's been fun, looks like my private key was compromised and my wallet was drained. No idea how my key got compromised.

About 7 hours ago (fast asleep at this time) some crook opened up my wallet, drained my aave position and absconded with about 15 eth and 600 dollars worth of shitcoins.

That's all I had left.

Thank you all very much for your kind words and advice.

In case you missed my earlier post, my wallet got drained by a nasty man and unfortunately I had 15 eth in an aave position and about 800 dollars of shitcoins I had recently fomoed into.

Gone, never to be seen again.

I have a separate PC for crypto stuff and I thought this was enough to keep me safe.

Wrong. So very wrong.

I clicked on a dodgy "update chrome" link on my work laptop yesterday, not realizing that I had sync turned on in chrome, meaning metamask (and my seed phrase vault) were on there.

That's the only way I can think this has happened.

Please, use me as a cautionary tale and be more careful with your crypto.

Here's the address that got drained in the wee hours of this morning and when I was getting my kids ready for school/nursery.

<https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d06340e5424ea2de37e5a1d2f410f6a0b40d58a>

Feel free to do some sleuthing, it's beyond me I'm afraid.

Peace.

<summary>u/timmerwb reminds us how tried and tested cold wallet seed phrases are for security and u/theethmeister shares their own diversification strategy for secure storage</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/186ihjr/daily_general_discussion_november_29_2023/kbc5o9i/)

[u/timmerwb](https://reddit.com/u/timmerwb):

At risk of tediously adding to the security discussion, risk is always an interesting subject. YMMV but in the several years I've been involved in crypto, IIRC, among all the countless losses, hacks, exploits, compromises and thefts that have occurred, of between 4 and 9 $figures in value, (and some of which have sadly involved members of our community), I don't believe a single one has involved the loss, discovery or theft of a physical passphrase, including a physical hardware wallet. It's worth adding that during the Ledger leak, which included numerous *active names and address* (lol - it's still hard to believe), there was mucho concern about wrench attacks. Again, AFAIK, not a single compromise occurred directly because of that leak, and not a single physical theft was attempted (although clearly email addresses got phished to death after that).

As such, the risk of loss is *overwhelmingly* associated with getting phished, or (usually mistakenly) storing credentials, including CEX accounts, on hot computers. For most people, best practice and good basic digital hygiene will ensure your crypto is safe.

Remember that security is an on-going process. If you create a new wallet, generating the seed or passwords *is not the first step*. You should already know what the wallet will be used for, the associated risks, how you are going to secure it and how you will maintain that security. Don't be tempted to "jot down" the seed temporarily etc. Give yourself time to learn and understand the process before committing funds. Stay safe out there.

[u/theethmeister](https://reddit.com/u/theethmeister):

To add to the discussion below about crypto security, my personal approach is to have about 20% in CEX and the rest split up among several (hardware) wallets, so if any single wallet gets compromised I can somewhat triangulate the cause of the hack. If you use Trezor you can create multiple wallets on one device using the passphrase function which in concept should protect you if your main seed phrase gets leaked or discovered.

If you do need to use Metamask you can create a separate wallet solely for your Trezor and don't have to store your seeds in an online vault. This should maintain the security of the hardware wallet while also allowing interoperability with dapps. Unfortunately Metamask seems to be the most compatible with dapps but because it's the most popular is a highly visible target for hackers/viruses.

Lastly, as to my CEX allocation I know "not your keys, not your coins" but having a sizeable amount gives me a higher transaction and withdrawal limit. Also if I need to liquidate assets quickly I can do so on my phone without having to tinker with my Trezor. *Knocks on wood* I haven't had to re-verify my account and perform KYC for the past 4 years. Always make sure to whitelist your withdrawal addresses.

<summary>u/ro-_-b is bullish on Ethereum's soul</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/185p2wo/daily_general_discussion_november_28_2023/kb5q944/)

A cryptocurrency is more than just an economic platform. Even though it has properties as some commodities it's not just a commodity. Ideally there is a purpose, values and culture. 

Beside the protocol we need the social consensus. People that keep up the values such as decentralization. In that sense it's like a religion. People need to believe in it.  And in order for people to believe certain properties need to be satisfied. And when you believe in something you naturally start to evangelize. 

Whatever Vitalik has said in public was genuine and well thought through. There are so many people that speak for Ethereum and hold up its values. Whenever somebody of these does something harmful the community holds them accountable. 

In my view the same standards are not met by other cryptocurrencies, definitely not by Soylano. 

Ethereum has a soul. It's more than just an ultrasound decentralized smart contract platform. 

And for these reasons it has cultural relevance. A tokenized meme very often derives its value from being on Ethereum. And everyone who creates digital art wants to have it issued on the most pristine platform. 

I'm certainly among the worst people to keep up these values. But I do rest assured because I know that there are many other people better than me precisely doing that and they're doing it very well.

So all this cultural relevance, this community ethos and these people that have conviction and believe in Ethereum make me bullish long term. Because in the end precisely these values is all we need to succeed. Roar ü¶Å!

Okey...this is a must read. New message from Kyber exploiter, their demands are not like others we have seen and interested to see how the story developed.

Between Hacker and Kyber, users funds are at stake. 

<https://twitter.com/TheDEFIac/status/1730196414154608785>

Edit - c +v below

To ALL relevant and/or interested parties,

I thank you for your attention and patience during this uncertain time for Kyber (the protocol/DAO) as well as Kyber (the company). Below I have delineated a treaty for us to agree to.


My demands are as follows:

* Complete executive control over Kyber (the company) 

* Temporary full authority and ownership over the governance mechanism (KyberDAO) in order to enact legislative changes. My current wallet address is fine for this.

* All documents and information related to company / protocol formation, structure, operation, revenues, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities, investors, salaries, etc. 

* Surrender of all Kyber (the company) assets. This is both On-chain and Off-chain assets. It includes but is not limited to: shares, equity, tokens (KNC and non-KNC), partnerships, blogs, websites, servers, passwords, code, social channels, any and all creative and intellectual property of Kyber.


Once my demands have been met, I will provide the following:

* Executives, you will be bought out of the company at a fair valuation. You will be wished well in your future endeavors. You haven't done anything wrong. A small error was made, rounding in the wrong direction, it could have been made by anyone. Simply bad luck. 

* Employees, under the new regime your salary will be doubled. It is understandable that many current employees will want to leave regardless. The employees who don't want to stay will be given a 12-month severance with full benefits and assistance in finding a new career, no questions asked.

* Token Holders and Investors, under this treaty, your tokens will no longer be worthless. Is this not sweet enough? I'll go further still. Under my management, Kyber will undergo a complete makeover. It will no longer be the 7th most popular DEX, but rather, an entirely new cryptographic project.

* LPs, you will be gifted a rebate on your recent market-making activity. The rebate will be for 50% of the losses you have incurred. I know this is probably less than what you wanted. However, it is also more than you deserve.


This is my best offer. This is my only offer.
I require my demands to be met by December 10, otherwise, the treaty falls through.

Additionally, should I be contacted by agents from any of the 206 sovereignties, concerning the trades I placed on Kyber, the treaty falls through. In this case, rebates will total to exactly 0.

Kyber is one of the original and longest-running DeFi protocols. No one wants to see it go under.

To assist with this transition of leadership, I may be contacted on telegram: @Kyber_Director

Thank you.

- Kyber Director

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17wfnq9/daily_general_discussion_november_16_2023/k9jsui5/)

To all the experienced blockchain users: As we witness improvements in user experience, particularly in wallet interfaces, do you feel apprehensive when using wallets or dapps that offer a more streamlined, Web2-like account creation and management process?

I've noticed that some users, especially in the Influence community, are apprehensive about creating new accounts or using accounts that are set up with an email.

Both Argent and Braavos, the current wallets on StarkNet, that are users interact with, utilize account abstraction, enabling and introducing features that I believe are crucial for bringing the next billion users to blockchain. Yet, this ease of use can sometimes be met with skepticism from existing users. I'm keen to hear your perspectives on this.

<summary>u/Samueth_Peapks is ready to see some non-speculative adoption</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17x8g4p/daily_general_discussion_november_17_2023/k9miyma/)

Should we be surprised at the speed with which the ecosystem has encountered a new wave of toxic tribal bickering? No, because compared to the end of the last cycle nothing has materially changed. There has been scaling progress but it is not finished by any means, and e.g. UX is as trash as ever etc.

ETFs are said to be around the corner, but the type of demand they represent is the same kind we are familiar with. Speculative, cyclical demand. Only now it's in a tax free wrapper! Don't get me wrong, the level of incremental increase in demand could be substantial, but i contend it will not change the dynamics of the crypto ecosystem. So if nothing has changed, we should not expect the nature of the next cycle to have changed. One slight difference is that at this time, the remaining market participants are certainly feeling less flush than they were in the heady days of 2021. Hence the rabid zero sum thinking we see amongst us (well, mainly twitter). At this point we all know the drill, some new and useless protocol or project will make 1000x returns for the few people who rolled the dice early, and many more will volunteer themselves as exit liquidity. 

Crypto has absolutely *nailed* the speculative use case; we do not need, and personally I am not interested in, any more. Games, quests, ponzis, whatever it is, it is all ultimately a waste of time, representing only a desperate grab for each others capital. What I think we crave, and what I am sitting here quietly waiting for, is utility. Yes, this is a 2017 era discussion, but nothing has changed since then. Large, non-speculative, non cyclical, fucking boring. Something that you would do anyway, even in a bear market, or if fees have increased a bit. Something that does not require a funny name for people to use. Something that companies or people will use due to economic gravity rather than hoping number goes up. 

Are these use cases possible? I believe so, so I guess I was incorrect to say that I am done with speculation. I'm still hopeful that blockchains can be used for e.g. supply chains, or something else like that. Why? because with something like this, crypto potentially has the ability to translate economies of scale away from large corporations, and to empower small businesses. Fewer bosses - ace! Not zero sum - ace!

Not all problems need to be solved to open up utility. E.g. a business use case will rely less on UX than a consumer use case. The type of demand I am talking about probably only cares about a few things (assuming the chain being used has the requisite functionality), and secure block space is premier amongst them. Ethereum represents the best potential holistic solution to all of these problems, probably via some L2 solution, primarily because of the strength of its network. Network effects are powerful, if they were not then twitter would be 6 feet under by now.  These reasons are why I have read the daily most days since early 2021. I am interested in client diversity, network health etc. Things of that nature are the means by which we create fertile soil for the future. And when the time comes we'll be glad that infrastructure has outpaced the current level of demand in the system.

Gitcoin invited me to develop a bundle for Grants Round 19, and I developed the [Stake from Home](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects?collectionId=stake-from-home) bundle. These 14 projects make contributions that empower individuals to run nodes and stake from home, and I strongly urge you to make a donation on gitcoin to the bundle. I'm familiar with all of the projects enough to vouch for them (on varying levels), and I'm excited for each of them to succeed.

If you don't know how gitcoin funding works: It's based on a concept called "quadratic funding", the simple premise is that the number of individual donors guides matched funds more than the amount anyone gives. So 100 people who give $1 each gets matched A LOT more than 1 person who gives $100. The moral of the story is that many hands make light work, so please go donate.

<summary>u/haurog shares how his opinion on Lido has changed over time</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17x8g4p/daily_general_discussion_november_17_2023/k9m9y95/)

Yes, economic incentives generally favours centralisation and monopols. That is the way things go. Societies try (or not) to find rules and regulations to fight against this general flaw in most modern economic systems. There are a lot of examples where societies failed to do so and have now very few monopolistic suppliers they cannot really break up anymore. There are also examples were societies managed to stop monopolistic set-ups in their track and these then are generally better off compared to societies which did not manage to do that in these specific industrial sectors.

The case with Lido, I did not really have an issue with them for a long time. My simple approach was "If they can break Ethereum it was meant to be broken". I did not judge them to be a bad actor in the space.

Nowadays I see them as a pretty ruthless actor in the space strategically gobbling up key figures and projects that make them dependent on Lido and do their bidding. At the same time they are spreading false narratives about why they are destined to win. Like "liquidity begets liquity" which automatically leads to them winning. What actually happens is that in the background they have actors (Karpatkey anyone?) making sure that steth dominance is not really threatened. They preach open and free markets, but actually do backroom deals to achieve their goal.

They also spread the narrative of being the wall against CEX staking and funnily mention a time where CEX staking had more inflow than them as the reason for it. Actually, this was as far as I remember a just a 2 weeks period in spring of 2022 where this was actually true. Again they are gaslighting the community.

They made so much money in the last 3 years, which is understandable because it is a good product. But now they can simply direct their faucet at anyone they want and more or less buy them, or a project. This is especially dangerous during the bear market where everyone is looking for funding. 

Same with the current proposal, in the first sentence the state decentralisation is the goal, but the rest of the proposal is a direct attack on the current relatively okayishly decentralised staker landscape. They love decentralisation as long as it is under their control...

Do I think Lido should be slashed rather today than tomorrow? No, definitely not, but I see them as a threat for the Ethereum ecosystem as they do not even try to hide behind a nice facade anymore.

<summary>u/austonst sums up the last day of DevConnect</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17xzw1y/daily_general_discussion_november_18_2023/k9tchdn/)

**Devconnect Day 9** ([Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17x8g4p/daily_general_discussion_november_17_2023/k9nmpmg/))

The last day of Devconnect! The schedule does technically extend through Sunday, but that's just the final day of the coworking space and the ETHGlobal hackathon. I had considered doing a little bit of sightseeing in the morning, but it was raining decently hard and I would have been pretty pressured for time, so I decided against it. Instead I just went straight to the day's main event: censorship.wtf .

As you might expect, censorship.wtf was all about censorship: what are the problems and potential solutions, particularly as it pertains to Ethereum of course. The day was literally packed: between 11:00 and ~18:00 there were non-stop 20-minute talks scheduled. Not a single break, you just had to pick which talk excited you the least so you could cut out some time for a bathroom break and snacks. Using acronym "censorship resistance"=CR The content was mostly pretty good:

* Juan Benet started the day with a high-level overview of factors that help or hinder in the struggle against modern digital totalitarianism. For example, we have surveillance everywhere, propaganda via modern computing, and social credit systems. These could be co-opted to empower a totalitarian society. To stave off totalitarianism we need education, string institutions, tech for secure communications and coordination, and a strong economy. Democracies are aware of the long-term danger, but are facing some actual short-term risks that they need to balance out. IP stack, CA system, app stores, and DNS are risky. ENS, IPFS, libp2p gud.
* Vitalik Buterin talked about hardening the Ethereum ecosystem across the stack. Fun fact: one of Vitalik's addresses is banned from the main Uniswap frontend because it used Tornado Cash once long ago. Alternative frontends gud. Centralized node providers are scary, we need light clients and muliple providers for a nice 1-of-n security model. Attacks against the social layer are possible but instead of being optimizing for an objecting ("convince everyone that ETH is bad") it'll be about amplifying the worst voices on both sides to create a toxic culture. A 51% attack is not the cheapest way to break Ethereum; much easier to mess with IP, DNS, etc.
* Sreeram Kannan introduced an observability gadget for CR. The question of "how bad is censorship on Ethereum" is hard to quantify but one metric is the time to censorship resistance (TCR), e.g. on ETH you usually don't have to wait too long to get a non-censoring proposer and builder, a few slots, so maybe a TCR of 0-40 seconds? But can we make it better? Proposed tx inclusion rule: when a block is proposed it must include tx's from recent uncles which have not already been included. With that as a rule, it follows that if a transaction is censored beyond a certain time, then >1/3 of stake can be slashed.
* u/nixorokish of EthStaker explained that solo stakers are valuable for CR. A critical line of defense, even. Solo stakers make up somewhere between 35-75% of *nodes* on the network (if I heard that right), providing diversity across geography, ISP, hardware, and software. Solo stakers are engaged and fundamentally care about the network, seen in evidence that they run a more diverse set of clients than most. EthStaker working on getting the knowledge DB in more languages too. Kind of preaching to the choir here.
* Sebastian B√ºrgel of hopr covered the topic of IP-level privacy. We all trust Infura from time to time to: deliver correct data, not censor, not track. The first two have been okay, tracking is a problem. Uniswap is bad: even on their IPFS deployment they track your device, addresses, and all your clicks, sending them back to their servers. Even if you're running on a decentralized frontend, if you connect to someone else's EL client for data, they can see what you're doing, link your on- and off-chain identities, and potentially abuse their position to frontrun whatever you're doing.
* Toni Wahrst√§tter of the EF examined censorship across the PBS stack. Proposers can censor in their own proposals, or take it further and not attest to certain blocks or even try to reorg them. Figment, Kraken, and Celcius are big censoring validators. Relay censorship has gotten quite a bit better since the Merge. Builder censorship on the other hand has gotten *very* concerning, like 80% censorship. Also examined feather forking on Bitcoin (link below), which lets even a minority miner compel other miners to censor the chain. On Ethereum this attack requires 51% of validators.
* In the middle of the day, Mike Neuder of the EF led a breakout workshop where we mostly reviewed forward inclusion lists, discussed the implications, and briefly considered out-of-protocol solutions (e.g. enforced by relays). It was mostly review and getting a deeper understanding of the potential attacks, mitigations, and remaining limitations. I threw a link in the linkydoo. There are some interesting out-of-protocol options too. I covered MEV-Boost+ earlier this week, also possible for relays to enforce proposer-provided IL's or to just include transactions themselves.
* Ed Felten discussed dealine protocols: any protocols that require on-chain transactions to occur before some deadline. These transactions can be censored though a combination of malicious (or bribed via mev-boost) proposers, and reorgs of honest validators' blocks. Censor it until the deadline has passed and you can do some damage. Ed designed a test that looks at the number of missed slots recently and computes with high probability if there has been no censorship.
* Mallesh Pai of SMG presented their work on CR in on-chain auctions. They measure CR through the lens of how expensive it would be to censor a transaction. They mathematically model the cost of censorship on a blockchain and analyze the impact on on-chain auctions. In general they think it's pretty cheap to carry out attacks on them. They suggest that in each slot there should be *multiple* block proposals, which places the proposers in a sort of n-party prisoner's dilemma that should discourage censorship.
* Justin Drake gave yet another talk, this time on weak censorship. He described his "append test" for censorship: if a transaction has been floating around a while and *could have* been appended onto the previous block, it's probably censored. Also, the bigger problems than censorship-induced inclusion latency and rollup throughput is the memetic cost. CR gives credible neutrality which gives social legitimacy which gives monetary premium which gives economic security and bandwidth. The idea that Ethereum is easily censored undermines that chain. He's optimistic about the combination of encrypted mempools, ILs, MEV burn, and ePBS. Also suggested some application of MEV burn rules to ILs, suggesting that a block would only be valid if it maximizes base fees?
* In the final talk, Venkatesh Rao is thinking beyond exit and voice. "CR is completing a transaction someone does not want completed, everything else is yield farming." When conflict arises, you have the choice to simply exit, or use your voice to participate in debate and discussion. Crypto has had a strong exit bias but CR is primarily a voice problem (not sure I agree?). Exit, taken to the extreme, gives you sovereignty but leaves you alone where you're no use to anyone. Bitcoin may accept that, but Ethereum probably shouldn't. There is also a tradeoff between efficiency and thoroughness. The Ethereum community can navigate the 2d space there: the exit-voice axis and the efficiency-thoroughness axis. Where do we want to be?

I guess I'll do a final recap tomorrow. Flying out first thing in the morning back to the other side of the planet. Going to be a long trip.

<summary>u/Fast_Contract explains why they're running RocketPool nodes</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17zhsdo/daily_general_discussion_november_20_2023/ka261d0/)

I think block/mev rewards will be crazy when the next bull starts. If these etfs really are approved, and tradfi money starts flowing in, I want to maximize my chances of winning that lottery. Solo staking I had a 96% chance of getting a proposal every 2 months. Now I have that same chance every 2 weeks. Sure joining the smoothing pool is probably safer, but holding eth as is, is already a lottery ticket to me so why not really play it.

I also re-evaluated the reason I'm in eth, and that's decentralization. 
I think rocketpool is an essential key to that. By dividing my stake up into as many 8eth pools as I can, I'm allowing a few hundred eth from other people to also be staked. Looking at reth mints, the demand is definitely there for reth, and with the houston upgrade, I think the demand for node operators will grow. I kinda hate Lido. I think they're everything that's bad about crypto and capitalism. Un-restrained growth perhaps at the expense of the entire ecosystem. Rocketpool is the opposite of that and I think more people should support it.

The "stake eth on behalf" thing in Houston is particularly interesting. I can see DAOs finally putting their eth treasuries to work. Also the rpl rewards rework is interesting, because it will hopefully reward/keep those at lower collateral rates above that 10% line. 

51% of rpl is staked. The only real sell pressure is from node operators getting out. I thought that cascade would happen weeks ago, but everyone seems content to keep their stake. Even on rewards day it seems like most rpl just gets restaked right back into the system... 

If I'm interpreting things correctly, most of the remaining un-staked RPL is rpl v1. RPL v1 has basically no liquidity, no movement. These people are just sitting on their rpl, they haven't even converted to v2? That kinda removes a lot more supply from the market in my mind...

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/180a3d0/daily_general_discussion_november_21_2023/ka7tdd7/)

Fellow Ethfinanciers...

It's weird that the market did not move today. I'd expect one last dump as a farewell. Oh well, there's plenty of time for that later. It's strange, because I feel what we witnessed today, was the end of the Wild West of cryptocurrency. The Napster Era is over, and soon, with the approval of the ETFs, the banking products, and the inflow of crypto "users", the iPod era will dawn. Nicely packaged, user friendly crypto products, ranging from tokenized stocks (registered and KYC'd strictly, of course) to JPMorgan limited edition Apple^^TM NFTs, barely holding any of the values that make crypto what it is.

The markets will soon start going up, much higher and faster than most anticipate, and I truly believe that Ethereum will be one of the winners. Droves of tourists will soon follow. Most of these people won't have the slightest idea what "keys" are, how you swap on DExes, or even what a smart contract does (It's probably something with AI in it).

Those of you that believe in something more than making money, remember why crypto exists. There are some values that are a net good for the world and need to live. The more of those carry over to TradFi, the better we'll all be.

I might be neither a crypto OG or an Ethereum veteran, but it has been an honor going through this bear with you.

Onwards!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/180a3d0/daily_general_discussion_november_21_2023/ka8l9rp/)

Just a rambling vibes take here. 1) CZ has always been a bad actor in crypto.  He proposed rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain (doesn‚Äôt matter your thoughts on btc, this is a huge red flag of not being decentralization aligned).  BNB chain is a centralized scam vessel.  He‚Äôs clearly been commingling funds and pumping bnb, been calling it forever and you don‚Äôt need a lawsuit discovery to see it.  

So overall this is a good day for crypto.  SBF and CZ characters are hugely damaging to the space.  Frankly the CEX world is the 1 place where SEC SHOULD be active and cracking down to make sure FTX like theft of user funds never happens again.  

They are also attacking kraken and coinbase for ‚Äúunregistered securities‚Äù which is complete nonsense.  

Let‚Äôs remember what these securities laws are meant to do. They‚Äôre meant to provide transparency to protect investors.  Instead we‚Äôve gotten onerous requirements not at all designed for the modern characteristics of crypto entities that has massively stifled innovation and investment especially in the US.  

Everyone remembers ICOs negatively because they were so boom bust but actually tons of innovation came out of them and it democratized access to super early stage investing to the crypto community.  Now after the harsh and chaotic securities enforcements pretty much only VCs are getting super early stage tokens.  It‚Äôs already a reproduction of the private company market where VC has locked out the huge gains from early stage companies from retail investors.  

The best world would be where the SEC protects us from SBF CEX and only comes down on true fraud (bitconnect, luna, etc) in the decentralized space. while allowing more experimental types of daos, etc to exist (especially when they are inherently transparent like many already are).

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/180a3d0/daily_general_discussion_november_21_2023/ka4tue1/)

devconnect istanbul is my first crypto related summit, and due to my location it‚Äôs also my first experience meeting with people in crypto community irl

devconnect was huge, filled with people of different backgrounds and interests, startups and independent developers that share their knowledge and vision to different problems. i met many interesting people, such as nice people from zksync (hello jack hamer, albiona, alex gluchowski, sasha vlasov, and many others whose name i didn‚Äôt ask), cool independent infrastructure builders that i‚Äôd rather keep anonymous,  ilia polosukhin from near, guys from EF (by the way u/domotheus we didn‚Äôt even shake hands wtf) and rollups teams. i listened speech of many popular founders and devs - vitalik, kartik talwar, sandy peng, jordi baylina, etc etc

it was so interesting to listen to all these speeches despite the fact that i already knew a lot of what they were about :P it‚Äôs all about people that have fire in their eyes and are ready to share all their knowledge to everyone at any cost

i also participated in my first hackathon. unfortunately i got sick in the first day and had to code in the hotel, so i missed many opportunities such as finding help from sponsors (yo zksync your compiler is terrible fix it pls) and generally being inside of this unique work atmosphere, but i still made [something](https://github.com/alexhooketh/xtra-protocol). in fact i spent 20 hours straight on coding at my first hackathon ever solo without any sleep while being sick af so i think the fact that i at least impressed judges is already somewhat achievement :)

and all this is in the huge beautiful city of istanbul that charges you with emotions every day and hour. i walked like 25k+ steps there every day before devconnect started and i wasn‚Äôt even tired. people there are always ready to help you even when you don‚Äôt ask and don‚Äôt ask anything in exchange. prices in locals‚Äô shops are always ‚Äúnegotiable‚Äù if you know your own worth xD public transport is really great with almost perfect coverage, istanbulkart is a great system that helps you to avoid so much brainfuck while travelling 

all this showed me how boiling and energetic 24/7 the life in the ethereum community and made me even more confident in that we do everything right. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm bullish!

<summary>u/CaptainOfTheGate describes more casual ways of getting privacy on Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1812a9r/daily_general_discussion_november_22_2023/kaawdeo/)

**"Casual" privacy apps**

Did you know that there are Ethereum apps that can give you a basic level of anonymity, without having to use a dedicated privacy app? Say you just want to keep people from knowing all your holdings by knowing your ENS name, these would work good. Not so good if you were doing something illegal, as a simple court order could reveal the connection between accounts. 

The major apps in this category, I believe, are the StarkEx single-app rollups. You can deposit from one address and withdraw from another. Only the StarkEx operator can see that it's the same person. For example, see [Privacy on rhino.fi](https://support.rhino.fi/en/article/privacy-on-rhinofi-a0ugb2/) for their explanation of how it works. 

There may well be other apps in this category as well (let us know if you're aware of others). For example, I've read that ParaSwap allows different deposit and withdrawal addresses, though I don't know if it's equivalent to the StarkEx rollups in this regard. 

You can see all the StarkEx rullups on [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary). Use *Select stack* to filter for just the StarkEx rollups. You can then click through to the individual projects to see how much TVL they have for the token you're planning to anonymize, e.g. USDC or ETH (I believe dYdX has the most stablecoins and Sorare has the most ether). 

Of course, you could use a regular privacy protocol instead. Tornado is sanctioned for US users, however, and others could be in the future, or maybe you just don't want to appear suspicious by using a privacy protocol. I haven't checked, but I assume Tornado still has the most volume. Some other projects I've heard about are: Railgun (a lot of mentions here recently), Aztec (highly regarded, but will be deprecated next year as they work on their programmable privacy rollup), Nocturne (new), Firn (sounds terrific but new), and Houdini Swap (seen mentioned here a few times).

Every now and then, I forget how stressful centralization is. Mostly thanks to avoidance. With forgetfulness comes confidence, so I try again, and I'm quickly reminded of the cons.

I wanted to use Coinbase to hop from a rollup to another without paying bridge fees. Now they're holding my outbound transaction hostage, with an enigmatic Pending. Contacting support nets me people escalating my problem to a "specialist team", which is meant to email me but apparently not in a rush to do so.

What's going on? Who knows. Complete black box. I suppose so are thirdparty bridges, in a sense... Yet I find the experience distinctively different. The dynamic changes when you use a protocol with a Discord channel where developers and knowledgeable users will interact with you. There's more visibility into their processes than with a corporate company presenting you with an interface where nothing suggests the exact nature of the problem, and support is outsourced to a call center where employees might do their best but simply aren't equipped to deal with the matter or deviate from a script.

I suppose that will be my booster shot against sending meaningful sums to a CEX, even as transit.

EDIT: followup, the transfer went through a few hours later. Whew!

**Devconnect Day 1**

Greetings from Istanbul! I'm at Staking Summit to start off my week (and change) of Devconnect fun times. I'm not going to give as detailed a daily summary as I've done for ETHDenver, but hope to give a little insight into what's happening.

Devconnect is a collection of independent events organized in the same week and in the same city. There's going to be a general coworking space opening up on Monday and available through the week, but most actual events are only 1-2 days long. Staking Summit is getting started a little "early", but seems to have gotten decent attendance.

Staking Summit has one stage with a series of talks and panels, a breakout area for occasional workshops, a lot of room for projects to set up booths, and a pretty nice spread of snacks. The event is advertised as being about PoS and staking in general, not just about ETH. I get the impression that some attendees are interested in staking as a financial vehicle, just as a place you can put capital to earn yield without caring too much about what it means. But not too much of that. Saw a lot of familiar faces already, met new folks too.

Most talks were kinda simple. A few things of note:

* A panel of investors talked about what they're looking for when investing in a staking company; a few of their comments: Any good idea can be copied, looking for ability to attract liquidity. Value of staking is ultimately supported by the crypto ecosystem behind the asset, looking for companies aligned with that. DVT and restaking provide additional investor optionality, but for restaking have to consider how much additional leverage they're building into the system. Institutions are still talking about Bitcoin, hopefully there's a growing awareness of ETH as an asset, and later the full range of staking offerings.
* Michael Hua, researcher at 1kx, thinks that the LST market will continue to get more competitive, and Lido's dominance may naturally dwindle. 1) Novel infrastructure offerings: Kiln, Stakewise v3, NodeSet, and better DeFi composability. 2) General market forces: Lido is not the best fit for institutions (e.g. KYL/AML) and we could see verticalization from frontends (e.g. wallets and exchanges making their own LSTs). 3) Unique token designs: protocol value accrual, vampire attacks, etc.
* Fisher Yu, Founder and CTO of BabylonChain talked about their system for "staking BTC". They imply that their system allows for trustless deposits, "restaking", and slashing. I don't know much else about it: if it works, if there are major caveats, how you can define slashing conditions on the Bitcoin blockchain, etc.
* Eugene Pshenichny, Protocol Dev at Lido, discussed their plans for the future of Lido. Staking router (for permissionless NOs) and dual governance (to give stETH holders some power) were things I was already pretty familiar with. They're looking to make use of EIPs 4788, 7002, and 7521 as they become available. Actually *not* particularly bullish on restaking. Considering a form of semi-ossification in which Lido contracts could only be modified at the same time as ETH hard forks. Thinking about a way to let validators move their stake between LSTs without having to exit and re-enter (would require an EIP).

(Posted this an hour ago, looks like it got deleted somehow? Taking out the links in hope it gets through the filters this time... EDIT: Yep, this one worked. Reddit hates links to conference webpages apparently.)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17so8sk/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2023/k8sisri/)

Here's some cool tips for people who may not know. 

I mainly use the metadex swap by the DeFi llama folks. 

[https://swap.defillama.com/](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

Obviously don't click my link and just start using it. It's the right link but practice some safety and look for an official source.

It works by querying multiple DEX aggregators, comparing their quotes and gas costs and allows you to choose the best one.

They charge no fee, so when you make a swap you are getting the exact same result that you'd get from swapping through an aggregator's UI directly.


As for MEVs and sandwich attacks, everyone making trades on chain should be using an MEV blocking rpc.

Find one here:

<https://chainlist.org/?search=Eth>

Not all are MEV blockers. The ones I know at a glance are - Llama, Flashbots, MEVblocker. whichever has the lowest latency for you.

It's easy to quickly change rpcs on desktop and there's no need to get sandwiched by Jared every time you want to trade shitcoins.

<summary>u/vvpan shares them and u/hanniabu fighting the good fight in another forum, explaining the usefulness of blockchain's innovations</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17so8sk/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2023/k8tb4oq/)

In a thread about blockchain on Hacker News, a place with high level of blockchain skepticism (/u/hanniabu is there too fighting the good fight), somebody asked me:

>Can you describe to me what the main point of "blockchain technology" is? What is there to innovate in terms of its core function?

I took the challenge to heart and wrote out this little post. I am worried that one cannot be exhaustive enough, but there it is.

\* Transaction throughput

\* Efficiency - allowing small scale players to participate in verification and block production.\* Inter-chain communication - some networks are explicitly designed as connected swarms of chains (Cosmos and polkadot for example) and some are evolving in that direction outside of the protocol level (Ethereum). How one executes transactions that span the networks is an ongoing research topic.

\* Privacy - how to execute transactions in private. How to attest that something is true, say that you have a certain credential, without exposing your account information. Blockchain has been why zero knowledge (and now homo-morphic encryption) cryptography are becoming an active field of research.

\* Identity, authentication, account recovery. - these tie into cryptography but generally research on applied cryptography with good UX. For example the first time I've seen social-recovery accounts with any amount of usage (now a feature in Apple accounts) was in a blockchain application.

\* Monetary research - far from everybody involved in crypto believes that a fixed-supply rare item makes for good money. "Fiat" money is basically a "token" with governance attached to it. This has lead to a wave of experimentation with other forms of tokens - ones that are algorithmically tied to other assets, ones that are backed by an organization, local currencies, etc.

\* Organizational research - since smart contracts can effectively be transparent community banks there's has been a plethora of experiments with building organizations that manage their own treasuries. Horizontalism, organizational transparency and cooperation is something that's been at the core of many crypto projects, the idea being that something cannot be both a reliable public good and controlled by a single party. It's not an easy task, but some cool organizations have come out of this. For an example look at pocket: [https://forum.pokt.network/t/messari-pocket-dao-exploring-proof-of-participation-governance/3857](https://forum.pokt.network/t/messari-pocket-dao-exploring-proof-of-participation-governance/3857)

In general, even if the blockchain experiment will fail it has given the world an ideological and technical boost.

Daily Holesky:  
Reported a logging bug with Lighthouse and sproul had already created [a PR to fix it](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4922).    
  
I've been playing with the [stakelocal grafana dashboard](https://docs.stakelocal.io) more, and continuing to provide feedback to metanull.  One key configuration change I had to do to tone down the spamming of errors in the syslog was to omit the `txpool` module from ethereum-metrics-exporter for Nethermind and Besu.  This is because Besu doesn't support `txpool_status` and ethereum-metrics-exporter doesn't know how to handle the integer values that Nethermind returns for `txpool_status`.  I've created [a GitHub issue for this](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter/issues/94).    Another conundrum I ran into was that the external validator and address links were working fine on my mainnet machine, but on my testnet machine, every `/` in links was being changed to `%2F` rendering them broken.  It took me a while to realize that I had used the .deb install method for grafana on the testnet machine instead of adding the repo where it stays up-to-date, so grafana-server was still on v9.5.1 instead of v10.2.0. Upgrading to the current version fixed the issue.
  
Something that was brought to my attention once I had the dashboard set up for all supported client pairs is that erigon is failing to honor the `--maxpeers` flag, so I reported that to their team.

<summary>u/Fiberpunk2077 is trying to understand the implications of EIP-4844. and u/djlywtf has a great reply</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17uvruy/daily_general_discussion_november_14_2023/k96og6c/)

[u/Fiberpunk2077](https://reddit.com/u/Fiberpunk2077):

I hope they don't mind, but I must summon the great minds to help me understand the implications of 4844:
u/domotheus
u/swagtimusprime
u/Liberosist

I asked some questions a few days ago around this, but I still don't understand what 4844 will do to L2 smart contracts and the data they hold with the ~18 day pruning.

To my very basic understanding, once 4844 goes live, rollups will use a new transaction type (blob) to commit the rollup data to L1 (instead of calldata). However, by using the blob transaction, the rollup data may be pruned/purged after ~18 days (whether it actually will or not is another thing). I've read that this blob data is meant for data availability, not data storage, but I don't understand what that means practically.

So this leaves me with many questions of what this means for smart contracts on L2's, and I can't get my mind around it. I think perhaps I'm getting confused between historical blob data for any given moment in time and storage of the current blockchain state (e.g., does the L2 store the current state?). Hopefully these dumb questions will help clear it up for me:

1. Post 4844, if I deploy a contract on an L2, will that be committed via a blob transaction? Or will L2's know it's a contract and use calldata instead? If it uses the blob transaction, does that mean the entire contract could be purged and not exist anymore?
2. If the contract does survive pruning, does it mean the data itself may be purged? For example, if I store an address for payment in a contract, could it suddenly be purged after 18 days and then the address is 0x0, effectively sending payment to the burn address?!
3. If data in contracts do get purged, does that mean the contract could be in some half available/half purged state if data is written to the contract over periods of time?
4. Somewhat unrelated, but can an L2 call an L1 smart contract?

I know I must be thinking about this incorrectly, because if any of this is true, I feel it's going to massively hamper L2 adoption and usability; that, or I'm missing some other big piece of the puzzle to mitigate this.

I also assume with full danksharding, the data pruning will be greatly lengthened, so perhaps this is a temporary issue?

Any clarity you can provide would be very much appreciated!

[u/djlywtf](https://reddit.com/u/djlywtf):

dom‚Äôs honorary nephew here

nothing in rollups state is ever pruned. currently, all transactions (or state diffs) are posted on calldata and thus are stored forever. when you run a rollup node, you can reconstruct the state yourself from this data on L1.

after 4844, you won‚Äôt be able to reconstruct the state from L1 data (unless someone stores all blobs). instead, you follow latest merkle root or anything that belongs only to the latest state (even hash of sqlite database), stored in the contract on L1 and updated each proven batch (ZK proved or challenge time ended). you can be sure that this data about current state is accurate, because it was proven in the past when you weren‚Äôt around from the data which WAS available then. then, you download the state from anyone with a rollup node. you‚Äôll get it if at least 1/N rollup node is honest, because its data will match merkle root or db hash or anything

temporary blobs purpose is to be used by sequencers that prove rollup batch and then update current state ‚Äúsignature‚Äù (it can be whatever works, most simple example is merkle root). nodes don‚Äôt need to store all transactions to reconstruct the state, because they can prove if the latest state that they receive from rollups nodes is actually valid on L1

for example, someone on zk rollup proposes the batch with transactions, sending it in the blob storage. now, everyone has all these txs for the next 18 days. sequencer/s start to generate the ZK proof to this batch, and when they‚Äôre done, they send it on L1 contract, it executes this ZK proof using commitment to the blob (fixed size thing that belongs to the blob and that they can access on EVM; don‚Äôt ask me how it works this is cryptography magic), and updates merkle root based on what state these txs changed. now this data can be safely pruned and nothing will break, but we also have optimistic rollups that have to wait for the challenge time, so we hold it for 18 days instead of say 2 hours

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi provides us an Arbitrum delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17uvruy/daily_general_discussion_november_14_2023/k9828i3/)

Recent ARB vote updates:

Using [100M of ARB funds for "Staking"](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf22530295daee96dffd7f70854475c06216a4d3594929672f71c12bf638bb0c8) passed the temperature check on Snapshot. The proposal would take 100m of DAO treasury and pay it out over holders who lock their ARB for 1 year. I voted no for this, as I don't think it adds much value to Arbitrum's chain and essentially is just paying people not to sell. Any economic value added is temporary, and likely would be out-performed by other projects. We shall see where this goes, as while it passed, there were a decent amount of no votes.

The DAO voted [to start an RFP process for security proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1ac6079871dc4af55b7d67eae130e4c1bbcbabd9bb35405bc1733ef2efe45875). I voted for this, as I prefer to see these types of things be standardized when people apply to allow for an even playing field.

The [‚ÄúArbitrum Coalition" vote failed. ](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37) This looked to have a group of delegates to be hands on with DAO proposals. Basically coordination and reviewing of proposals at certain stages. I voted no on this, as some of the council also had a large share of voting power. My fear being it would create a centralizing effect. I'm not opposed to the broad idea, but there needed to be stronger separate of powers here --- ideally those on the council had no voting power. I think this failed as a lot of other delegates felt similar to me.

The [STIP grants that pass the yes/no voting, but did not meet the 50 million threshold were voted to be backfunded. ](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc040de9c6a85dee5ca15de10691165bf5595245ffac922cbef61e45199522345) Honestly, this was a tough one for me. I wasn't a huge fan of back funding projects, especially because of the precedent it will set. However, IMO the DAO really dropped the ball on the first grant round with how it was set up. I'm not sure punishing the ones that passed, but failed to be as popular, is really great when it's more the DAOs fault for a poor setup. So in the spirit of the original proposal, I voted to pass but wouldn't be doing this again if a future round finds this issue. I'll add, the spend was going from 50 million to 71 million. Which didn't seem overly outrageous, and was actually in line with original ARB amounts proposed until it was reduced from 75 Million to 50 Million.

To those possibly concerned, LIDO did fail their yes/no vote so it wouldn't get funded with this round either.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17vn3bx/daily_general_discussion_november_15_2023/k9cxci8/)

New scammer tactic on an /ethereum staking thread.

Posted a link to a fake staking service (Block Scape) which they immediately upvoted with ~30 bots. I called it out in a reply. So far so normal.

They then deleted their original comment, blocked me so that I can't report them or reply again and then upvoted the new one. Very annoying strategy. 

Stay safe out there, and if anyone wants to do a favour and report the scammer then please do!

[Edit, and of course they are now using their bots to downvote my top level comment calling them out.]

<summary>u/benido2030 is continuing their effort to make EthFinance a governance powerhouse</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17bb5od/daily_general_discussion_october_19_2023/k5inz8r/)

A few days ago I made my "[Let's make ETH Finance a Governance Powerhouse](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/178y9gp/comment/k53tnhe/)" post. First of all thank you for the positive feedback both with comments and upvotes! I have been thinking some more about it and even though there wasn't a real pushback, I would like to update it and cut it down to three steps.

1. Coordinate
2. Delegate
3. Communicate

After reading my own post a couple of times, I asked myself. "How would you respond to this if this was posted by someone else?" My gut feeling: It's a good idea, but it's too complex. We need to start with an MVP for governance and coordination. Hence, here's a short "Minimum viable coordination" (MVC) update:  

**1) Coordinate**

Once an airdrop is announced, we try to coordinate as fast as possible. 

We collect potential delegates from this community. Members can both announce their motivation to be a delegate for the protocol and members can suggest other members.  

We publish a list of  "aligned" delegates that are close to this community, but not daily active. 

We try to focus on a few delegates to make sure "our" delegates have a lot of tokens delegated and hence governance power. 

Obviously everyone is still free to become a delegate, but if we can achieve to agree on e.g. 2-3 "official" candidates that focus on one protocol, this would have a lot of benefits. My suggestion is also to that the "official" delegates should be delegates for one protocol only. My best educated guess is that the time needed for "good"/"professional" governance will be up only and in the future being a delegate for 2+ protocols will be very hard. 

**2) Delegate**

Well, this part is easy. We delegate our tokens to our "official" delegates. 

Why is it an extra step? Just to emphasize that it's coordination first and delegation second. Or in other words: I think it would be very beneficial if we all be patient. Don't claim on day one since most of the time the delegation is part of the claiming process. Let's try to make sure we really had some time to agree on candidates. 

**3) Communicate**

This is happening already, but we should do this as much as possible. Tag your delegates if you have question/ feedback. Or as a delegate: Talk to the community, ask for feedback if you are a delegate. 

The delegates are our ears and eyes for that protocol. E.g. I would have missed the LDO proposal, but I am very happy it was discussed here. We need this kind of activity to inform the community, align and coordinate even better than before. 

&#x200B;

I think this MVC is way better than the first one. Yeah, reporting sounds cool, but it might be overblown (and corporate?). And yes, preparation for a potential airdrop sure makes sense, but could also be a lot of work for something that never happens. Let's try to coordinate ad-hoc when there is a need. If that works out, we can always improve and add more steps. 

Airdrops are usually a big news and my guess would be that members that are mostly reading here will come to ETHFinance on these days. By definition I will not know what most of those lurkers will think of my suggest or do when we need to coordinate, but allow me to state this: You are the majority of this community and you all - as a group of lurkers - probably have more governance tokens than the active / posting members. I would really appreciate your silent coordination by reading and silent acting by delegating your tokens to a delegate from the community!

<summary>u/jtnichol reflects on how EthFinance dodged a bullet with Reddit's community points</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17cuvcq/daily_general_discussion_october_21_2023/k5tw84x/)

Reddit is sunsetting community points across cryptocurrency ethrader, and Fortnite BR... I don‚Äôt know what the next move will be for the project as a whole, but I‚Äôm still very very happy. We did not get involved with such a centralized mess of points and karma

Moon price dumped big time prior to the announcement also which speculated the moderators had inside her information this was going to happen on /r/cryptocurrency and Fortnitebr specifically.

that‚Äôs all speculation based on a tweet I‚Äôve ever had that. Showed the timing of everything.  /u/spacesider hear anything like that?

<https://x.com/DegenerateNews/status/1714353397330002253?s=20>

Edit...ethtrader too <https://reddit.com/r/ethtrader/s/mxYAn7ShXP>

Double edit... holy shit looking through those subs and the amount of fighting and pissed off people over something we all knew years ago, was going to ruin the Reddit experience.

passing up that opportunity was the best thing moderators here could‚Äôve done because it is a complete train wreck now over there in those other subs . 

also, Reddit red hats have just created such a catastrophe by not seeing this through or figuring out the token mechanics of it .... they basically told the moderators it was going to be over in a month and that was that. They should‚Äôve just rugged everybody equally the same time but they didn‚Äôt.  

and just don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt put more effort into figuring out the token mechanics. Who knows it was probably because of all the discord pump groups that are being talked about as well with the vote manipulation. Color me shocked. ... maybe it was a regulatory thing.... who knows but there was not enough effort to see it through after such a long, hard road of picking out which layer two to use, etc..

Watch those communities evaporate quickly. I have no doubt they will probably see a good 75 to 80% less traffic because of all the click farm activity and Discord vote manipulation tactics.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17dlmmp/daily_general_discussion_october_22_2023/k5z555t/)

[There was a post in yesterdays daily regarding Reddit community points](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17cuvcq/daily_general_discussion_october_21_2023/k5tw84x/) and JT tagged me and asked for my input, and I have only seen the post just now, so I will follow up in today's daily for greater visibility /u/jtnichol 

--------

Basically, we were both privately and abruptly told by the admins that community points are getting killed and they will be no more in just a few weeks. 1 hour later the admins shared this information to the wider community. So /r/CryptoCurrency mods knew about this before everyone else, as well as the mods also over at /r/FortNiteBR and /r/ethtrader too as they also have RCP. (Reddit community points).

[Well, some mods used this private information to their own personal advantage and decided to sell, because the price was going to obviously crash when it was to be made public one hour later.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/17b8lqe/a_list_of_the_mods_who_did_and_didnt_dump_their/). Some more information in that link.

It's also been reported on two big websites if anyone want additional details.

<https://www.theblock.co/post/258476/pair-of-reddit-mods-appear-to-have-sold-off-tokens-ahead-of-announcement-to-terminate-blockchain-based-program>

<https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-mods-dumped-tokens-hours-before-blockchain-program-termination>

This is really *not* a good look and I have absolutely no idea what (If any) potential consequences of this is going to be. My personal thoughts on the matter?

When RCP's were first announced (Around half a year prior to me becoming a mod), [I voiced my concerns as a comment on the announcement.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gj96lb/introducing_rcryptocurrency_moons/fqk4iay/)

Many years and countless hours later from everyone involved, I must say that it is still sad to see it go because this could have been a huge opportunity for Reddit to make web 3 way more mainstream than it currently is. So this is probably going to set things back a bit for us. I guess Reddit are only focused on money though and if it initiatives like this can't bring them in more money (Probably due to rumours about how they want to IPO), then they will be axed to make things look prettier for investors. So probably the entire Reddit platform might go in an entirely new direction.

We did ask if the smart contract could potentially get handed over to the mods for us to continue in our own capacity, but the admins haven't said anything back to us about this. 

I guess now that upvotes are not monetised anymore there will be a big drop in comments and in theory an increase in quality, as all the people who participated only to farm karma will now (hopefully) move onto other more productive things. I guess time will tell!

I find this so fucking weird. The artists that *have* branched into NFTs love it from what it seems.

> I get 100% of the primary sales. Galleries take 50%. For the entire month of July I sold a teeshirt. $20. [Reddit's Collectable Avatar] program allows me to make art every day.

> ...before this project I was pretty against NFTs for all the obvious reasons that most people are. Mainly the predatory, mlm scamming structure that turned a lot of people off to them. But people need to know that this project is far more like patreon, your purchase goes right to the artist. You see an artist you like and want to aid them? you throw them a couple bucks. To be honest seeing the resales was even a surprise to me. But I don‚Äôt see it that different than any other form of investing, it‚Äôs all numbers on a screen to me. I would, however encourage people to not get over their heads and play it safe. Please don‚Äôt gamble your life away.

> I actually intend to recycle my earnings into putting on art shows and installations myself. I‚Äôm sick of begging galleries for attention, I‚Äôm just gunna rent out warehouses and do it myself and invite the public to see. Not only did this program free me from the extreme stress of trying to make rent, it allows me to circumvent the dusty old gate keeping artworld and do what I want to: to show the whole world my art. This program is dope as shit.

Excerpt below from a newsletter I get called The Defi Edge - it is uncanny how exactly it describes me and my behaviour in the last 2 cycles. Like he could literally have been writing my story. 

Anyone else do this?

Waiting patiently for the next cycle to (I hope) do what I didn't, the first two times:
---
"Have you ever heard that it takes roughly 3 Crypto cycles before you "make it"?

You're an idiot in the 1st cycle. You're figuring out all the basic concepts. You trust influencers a little bit more than you should. 

4 years later...

You're smarter in the 2nd cycle, but you become a little too overconfident. You think, "This time, it's different." You're not taking profits like you should and mis-time the market cycle.

4 years later...

The 3rd cycle. You either "make it," or you repeat the same mistakes.
Notice the 4 years part.

This isn't League of Legends or Chess, where you can play every day if you want to. The bull market tends to come once every 4 years on average. So, your "feedback loops" are slower."

<summary>u/696_eth talks about the fun aspect of solo staking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17fx5jb/daily_general_discussion_october_25_2023/k6grb7a/)

I'm surprised staking hasn't gotten more degen light. All you see is like 3.7% APR when you solo stake bluh bluh. Yes, that's helpful and that's too intellectual. 

Why wouldnt we just make it intellectual cause we can calc averages etc etc and move on? well that's how I did it too but staking isnt just that for humans. 

Let me explain a bit more. 

Staking has consistent rewards which are quite negligible unless you are a whale but you get some passive income and that feels stable, secure and good and it can even attract the crowd that does FatFIRE and all that stuff in tradfi. 

However, there's more to staking. There's a sync committee which is again more stable gains while you are there yet the key part is that it's random occurrence in one's process. 

And the ultimate form of dopamine rewarding would be a block proposal. Timing of that is random (yes there's a probability the same way there's a probability in blackjack or roulette) and on top of that - the reward is random! So you are basically having a chance at winning the lottery (also way better chances than in real lottery) and you get to play it for free!! Well, kind of. You have to stake. 

So unless you are a big corporate entity or in a smoothing pool (altho that would still apply to some degree but not so much), just the possibility of having stability (thru regular attestations) + some occasional bonus for doing the job well (sync comm) + free lotto tickets that can be lifechanging (block proposals) !!! I feel like if more people knew this was the case instead of just boring APY part they might've been staking purely in hopes of degening in a smart way (since you lotto tickets are free) and helping out the decentralization in the process. 

Anyways, im curious what has your experience been like? do you feel some excitement staking or at least whenever you get notifications about sync comm + proposing blocks? if not, how does it make you feel then?

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17f4y90/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2023/k67z378/)

I am moving out of Lido and decided to "Withdraw" instead of trade out my stEth.  They say this may take 1-4 days.  Anyone build any good way to more accurately predict when my withdrawal will take place and be ready to claim? I'm patient but just wondering if there's a better estimate somewhere...

EDIT: Little more research.  So Lido creates an NFT that is minted the second you create a withdraw request.  The NFT is then "transferred"  and burned once the eth is ready to claim and claimed.  So with a little bit of guessing, you can see when the last "transfer" was and how long it took between their mint and the transfer and guesstimate.  [Example of one](https://etherscan.io/nft/0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1/12919) that has been minted and transferred.  About  5 days and 9 hours from request withdraw to being claimed.  Of course it might have been ready at 4 days and it took 1 day and 9 hours for the user to claim it... Anyway, I wait patiently :)  I feel better doing a withdraw and knowing the stETH is being burned instead of transferred onto someone else.

<summary>u/MinimalGravitas has some thoughts after the community pushback against Lido's Arbitrum DAO proposal</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/176qwfi/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2023/k4pcsll/)

Thoughts on the victory over Lido in Arbitrum's STIP round (apologies for a bit of a brain dump):

**1) Today** - We should celebrate, be grateful and allow ourselves the happy vibes of the 'good' side winning. We've won a battle, but as I said [a couple of weeks ago](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2p3xc3/) this is going to be a long war. One of the best ways to build resilience to keep grinding is to pay attention to the rewards your brain gives you when you win. 

**2) Tomorrow** - If you harassed a delegate to get them to vote, or to change their vote or whatever then reach back out to them over the next few days. Everyone likes it when you say thanks, and everyone prefers it when they don't feel like you forget about them after you've got what you wanted.

If delegates voted no after you messaged them, or even if no one contacted them then why not message them to suggest they take a look in EthFinance of Reddit? Sales teams and political lobbying groups take people out to dinner to keep them on side, maybe our equivalent to that would be inviting delegates here... I honestly think that The Daily is a more valuable Ethereum community than any Discord or Telegram group, so why not leverage some of that value to buy goodwill from DAO delegates who have shown themselves to be at least somewhat aligned to the cause of protecting Ethereum L1.

**3) Next Week** - With Lido losing here, being vampire attacked, and the threat they pose being discussed in multiple Ethereum podcasts recently it's a good time to press the advantage. Up the 'social pressure' (which it turns out can be quite useful after all) by calling out their attempts at spin and damage control. u/hanniabu has set a great example of doing this. Their representative who proposed the Arbitrum request was on Twitter claiming the results were 'razor tight', so don't let them control the narrative.

In a dogfight one of the ways you beat an opponent is by overwhelming their Cognitive Load, give them too many things to think about to be able to effectively counter all of them. Lido have a lot to think about at the moment so we'd be throwing away an advantage if we let the pressure up too much.

**4) The Future** - We need to get more coordinated. We've got delegates in lots of DAOs but can we find more? Can we start compiling resources of delegates that might not be part of EthFinance but can be relied upon to recognize the threat Lido represents if they come knocking for funds and integrations? Can we start predicting where they might go next and reach out to delegates in other DAOs before any decisions even get put to them?

u/_WebOfTrust has discussed the possibility of changes to constitutions that would prevent these kinds of funding requests for Lido even coming to the proposal stage, what would that look like and what DAO's might take it up?

How can we keep respected Ethereum media discussing this? Obviously some members (like u/EvanVanNess) are already working on that, I'm sure we can try to keep the focus on for some others too. The Bankless guys used to frequent here sometimes and have had a recent episode with Danny Ryan as well as promoted Diva's Vampire attack, lets praise and promote those positive actions to encourage them to do more.

We need to get to grips with how important votes in the ecosystem work, before the final day of their decisions - it was pretty funny the number of different interpretations as to how Arbitrum's pass/fail was decided, I certainly didn't understand it until yesterday evening. It worked out fine this time, but we can learn from that and do better next time.

Because there will be a next time. Ultimately I believe that competition from other staking protocols is going to be the solution to getting Lido below 22%, but that won't happen quickly, and Lido will fight hard to grow as much as they can before other options can catch up. The social layer is not the long term way to get this fixed, but is is a tool we have now and may be the best we have to defend our network for the near future - so lets learn from this victory and hone the abilities we have so that we can hold the line and push back for as long as we need to. I've never felt more optimistic that it's possible for us to do so.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/176qwfi/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2023/k4o925a/)

Governance token holders everywhere, particularly ARB holders or even OP and other governance token holders who delegate ‚Äî now is a good time to ask yourself if you are happy with who you have delegated your tokens to. After [the recent Lido ARB proposal,](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6b89b74c259d2cc5979c46be6cfe2ae20f9485eee728a628f56930db644da985) some names I once knew have either gone up or down in my personal reputation. It may be worth checking all protocols which you delegate your tokens on and check your delegate's track record and change or speak up if necessary.

Changes of who I see as reputable.

**Reputation gain: +++**

<summary>u/RooftopPortaPotty updates us on their project PreservationDAO</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/176qwfi/daily_general_discussion_october_13_2023/k4ptloq/)

Piggybacking on all the recent discussions regarding DAOs here, I aim to provide another perspective.

Two years ago I resolved to, along with the invaluable work of other ethfinanciers, launch PreservationDAO. Our aim is to preserve habitat by purchasing land of significant ecological value using funds generated by on-chain donations.

The landscape of Ethereum has obviously changed drastically since then, but our ideas and general plans were compiled by the great /u/haurog, and can be found at https://github.com/preservationdao/preservationdao.

We were quickly met with a wide array of challenges and obstacles. Some of these issues have likely been solved to some extent by this point.

I will assume that any interested members have read the linked github page. The following will be an attempt to address some of these challenges, and to detail solutions where available.

1. I personally lacked the funds necessary to get this project off the ground. Unfortunately, this has not changed.

2. We felt it wrong to launch an environmentally-oriented project on a proof of work chain. Post-merge, this is a non-issue. However, we may still want to choose a L2 to avoid high gas fees.

3. I spent quite a long time trying to find an appropriate law firm to help create a land-owning, on-chain, 501 (c) (3) organization, to no avail.

4. Ensuring that the meatspace treasury has no ability to embezzle funds is paramount, and I dont see a clear solution.

5. With a non-transferable ERC-20(or NFT?) that is distributed to donators, who may then vote for lands to purchase, how do we mitigate sybil attacks?

6. Ensuring that qualified contributors are able to make their donations tax-exempt is a priority. This project must not be limited to properties within the US.

7. What assets should we accept as donations? There are many downsides to market selling ETH in order to purchase property.

I implore any interested ethfinanciers to contribute in any way possible.

I would love to see this comment receive significant traction. Otherwise, PreservationDAO can be re-shelved until we have a clear path to success laid out.

**JP Morgan Onyx on Digital Identity in Web3**

They have a video and are doing a 4-article series.

The first one - **The Big Shift** - was released back in 2022.

Let's see what they understand.

*New web - new rules.*

New verification methods that are more secure, trustworthy and easier to use.

Prior to the blockchain and even so far, the digital online world has been copying the physical world leading to many issues around identity pieces:

‚Ä¢ unsecured communication

‚Ä¢ inefficient and dangerous practices

‚Ä¢ stolen identities

‚Ä¢ much more

Web3 - introduces new possibilities.

They clearly understand how web1 changed the world through e-commerce and how web2 sparked innovation through the rise of social networks and user-generated content.

What about web3? It brings the pieces of:

**Decentralized system:**

‚Ä¢ Digital ownership of your data

‚Ä¢ Ownership of your assets

‚Ä¢ Flips the relationship between companies and users 

& many more possibilities

‚Ä¢ Adds more cross-platform utility 

‚Ä¢ Adds provenance

‚Ä¢ Adds immutability

That means **web3** can bring another magnitude of **innovation**:

‚Ä¢ Streamlining online business models (less friction for users)

‚Ä¢ Saving time (reduce verification times)

‚Ä¢ Making proving easier, more secure and private

‚Ä¢ Reducing costs and unlocking more liquidity (faster and transparent public services)

For all of that to work we need to Update our Digital Identity.

That's where **Decentralized Digital Identity** comes with a range of benefits:

‚Ä¢ Sovereignty (you have control and choice of your data)

‚Ä¢ Security (no points of failure)

‚Ä¢ Immutable and irrefutable (highly trustworthy information)

While all of that sounds good, it's a very complex challenge to bring all the pieces together.

This leads us to their second article - **Assessing Web3's Identity Building Blocks** - was published sometime in 2023.

First of all, they are reiterating their points from the first article.

But now they are getting a bit more specific and tangible.

Starting with an overview of the digital identity landscape and highlighting 4 essential building blocks.

1. **Identifiers** aka everyday tags:

‚Ä¢ Names

‚Ä¢ Email addresses

‚Ä¢ Accounts numbers

‚Ä¢ Social handles

& many more

Web3 ones are:

--- *Ethereum Naming Service (ENS)*

‚Ä¢ Turns 42-character Ethereum public address into a human-readable name

‚Ä¢ Represents multifaceted identity

‚Ä¢ Includes a variety of blockchains

‚Ä¢ Utilizes offchain information

‚Ä¢ Includes website URLs (domains)

‚Ä¢ All other identifiers

All of that is in one name!

--- &Lens handle*

‚Ä¢ A user profile on the social graph of Lenster, Lenstube, etc

--- *Other naming services as identifiers (Unstoppable Domains and others)*

DIDs (Decentralized identifiers) are fundamental blocks of the self-sovereign identity (SSI):

‚Ä¢ uniqueness (no confusion) 

‚Ä¢ provability (proof of ownership)

‚Ä¢ portability (owned by an owner and cannot be deleted, cross-platform usage)

It's just a sneak peek and more is coming in the next article!


2. **Identity attributes** (attestations of facts or data points):

Examples:

*Proof of Humanity (PoH)* - Ethereum-based social identity verification system

*Soulbound tokens (SBT)* - public, permanent, non-transferable NFTs that can represent a person's digital identity attributes onchain. 

*Verifiable Credentials (VCs)* - A W3C data model for sharing and verifying identity credentials that can be stored offchain allowing for privacy and scalability.

3. **Reputation**

It is a key part of one's identity and makes us who we are.

*POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol)* is a notable example of this.

4. **Digital collectibles and assets**

NFTs contributing to one's identity:

‚Ä¢ profile pictures (PFPs)

‚Ä¢ digital art

‚Ä¢ in-game items

‚Ä¢ membership NFTs

& more

Digital Identity can bring all the pieces together.

To gain scale and mass adoption, it's crucial for wallets to enable a seamless building of one's digital identity.

Account Abstraction (AA) solves some of those challenges. 

Combining 4 of the essential blocks (Identifiers, Identity attributes, Reputation, and Digital collectibles & assets) with one another, can form a holistic identity.

Onyx's experience with Decentralized Digital Identity:

‚Ä¢ observing the DID space from 2017

‚Ä¢ identified use cases

‚Ä¢ built concept solutions

‚Ä¢ explored digital identity for institutions on public blockchains and experimented with VC and DID technology through a collaboration with *the Monetary Authority of Singapore and SBI Digital Asset Holdings*

‚Ä¢ remain open-minded and continue exploring other methodologies for a variety of use cases

The conclusion of this article leads back to their digital identity part of the site.

They have a range of documents on other web3 and crypto-related topics.

It is obvious, that they are not thinking about Digital Identity in isolation as they are aware of nuance niches within web3 such as metaverse, DeFi, and even real-world assets.

They clearly articulate how it can be helpful for:

‚Ä¢ online interactions (ownership, portability, security)

‚Ä¢ creators (by moving platforms) 

‚Ä¢ gamers (asset-interoperability)

‚Ä¢ real-world applications

In navigating the rich space of Web3, JP Morgan Onyx lays a strong emphasis on the transformative **power of Decentralized Digital Identity**. Their explorations highlight the potential that comes with blending digital identity with emerging tech realms like metaverse, DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi and the tangible world itself.

**What else do you already see that JP Morgan Onyx still doesn't?**

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

This is one of my biggest learnings: it‚Äôs so easy to spend ETH in a bull market. So many cool narratives. So many people making a quick buck. 

And to be fair: you should be experimenting because that‚Äôs how you learn. But you should also keep in mind that every buy diminishes your ETH stack. Your long term bet. The asset that will not go to zero next bear. 

So I think a budget for experiments works well. Don‚Äôt spend more than the budget and you‚Äôre good.

[u/Juankestein](https://reddit.com/u/Juankestein):

Around 3 years ago I realized this. EVERYONE wants your BTC and ETH.

* ICOs wanted your ETH
* Scammers want your ETH
* Exchanges have BTC and ETH reserves
* Lending platforms stake your ETH
* DEXs want your ETH liquidity

Just hold BTC and ETH and forget about it, that's probably the most boring strategy but also the most rewarding and less stressful...

My Plan for 2025 is to convert all the 2017 and 2021 shitcoins into BTC, ETH, USDC and maybe another token I want to bet on.

<summary>u/benido2030 wants to make EthFinance a governance powerhouse</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/178y9gp/daily_general_discussion_october_16_2023/k53tnhe/)

**Let‚Äôs make ETH Finance a governance powerhouse**

In the light of the lido threat and their ARB request this community has shown a brilliant reaction. The topic was heavily discussed, delegates coordinated and a lot of great posts have been made. u/minimalgravitas made this post last week and I would like to add some thoughts with regards to ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äù since I completely agree that we need to coordinate even more than ever before.

**Some assumptions before I start outlining my thoughts**

* This community has a lot of smart and thoughtful people
* This community cares about ETH‚Äôs values and has developed a strong sense of community and belonging over years
* We have existing infrastructure to coordinate, which is a strong foundation (happens to be reddit right now, but could be something off reddit as well)
* This community owns sizeable stacks of governance token (mostly airdropped, some bought on the open market)\*
* We shouldn‚Äôt focus on lido, but be agnostic to be able to respond to all threats Ethereum is and will be facing in the future

So how can we coordinate more/ better to become a governance powerhouse? I think we need to be structured and prepared beforehand. I also think that for now (let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúphase one‚Äù) we should also limit ourselves to the current community. Still this will be a huge change and will probably need people dedicating a good amount of time to make things happen.

**Step 1: Analysis/ Identification:**

This step needs to be done both internally and externally. These steps should happen regularly to be prepared for e.g. an airdrop, possibly every 3 to 6 months (tbd), but potentially also ad-hoc.Internally: We need to understand our members strengths, interests and availability. Some questions I would ask to identify potential delegates: Who is capable of representing ETH Finance as a delegate? Is the member focussed on a certain topic/ category? Is the member a delegate already? Is the member free and willing to work as a delegate? I think people should both be able to suggest other members, but also apply as a delegate.Externally: We need to understand which protocols / categories of protocols are critical to ETHs health, both direct and indirect. Direct in this case means e.g. relevant for ETH‚Äôs security and / or decentralization. Indirect could mean because of a large treasury and its economic power.So let me give you an example:I think the EigenLayer airdrop will happen at one point in time in the future. Let‚Äôs assume the token is a governance token. A lot of smart people see Restaking as a potential threat to Ethereum's security. Hence I think we should try to make sure there is (at least!) one community delegate for EigenLayer.We should identify capable and willing members now to make sure once the airdrop happens we can act fast. Personal opinion to make it even more concrete: I would suggest u/hanniabu for EigenLayer delegate because I believe restaking is critical and believe that they have proven themself in the past couple of weeks both on reddit, but also on twitter.Best case we can identify up to 3 delegates per critical protocol so that we can act fast. Down the road we would basically have a table that serves as an overview of potential delegates per category.

Example:

* L2s: Member X, Member Y
* Defi: Member Z
* (Re)Staking: Member A, Member B
* NFTs: Member C
* Infrastructure: Member D, Member E

**Step 2: Coordination and delegation**

This step will usually be helpful after a token launch/ airdrop. It basically formalizes step 1.After a token launch announcement we try to understand our ‚Äúpower‚Äù, so try to get a feeling for our power by estimating our token allocation (this will be fun, cause it will be so hard to estimate lurkers and their allocations). Based on this we agree on a number of delegates.After that we ask the potential candidates if they are still interested and confirm 1-x ‚Äúofficial‚Äù delegates. The process? To be defined! Most likely via reddit, maybe an extra post? The daily?Important: obviously everyone is still free to run as a delegate even if they are not the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù community delegate. Also everyone is still free to delegate to a completely different delegate. We can‚Äôt tell people to not run as a delegate and we can‚Äôt force people to delegate to the community‚Äôs candidate.From my point of view the goal of this step is to delegate as many tokens as possible to the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù candidate to make sure our representatives have power. I think it‚Äôs better to have 3 candidates with 1M tokens each than to have 30 candidates with 100k tokens (or even less because people choose external candidates).But why would you do that? This is where step 3 comes in:

**Step 3: Collecting feedback**

I think we have a big advantage over other delegates: We can crowdsource feedback. Or in other words your delegates will usually understand your position (because you post it or upvote those comments that summarize your position in the best way possible) and will best case act based on the feedback.So what should the process look like? I think there are two possible ways.Delegate driven: The delegate will usually be aware of important topics, discussions and votes. They could either publish their position on a certain topic in the daily or they could ask for feedback if they have no idea/ position yet. I think this is the best scenario, but this might not work all the time. Delegates might not see a certain vote as critical as the community, might not have enough time to check all discussions proactively etc.Community driven: So the community members could tag the delegate to express their view on a certain issue. I think this has already worked pretty well the past couple of weeks and is already part of the community DNA.Based on the feedback the delegate forms their opinion and votes. Important: The delegate is of course (?) free to make the decision they think is best. The community feedback is a suggestion on how to vote, but not binding. If people are unhappy with the delegate they are free to redelegate (see step 5).

**Step 4: Reporting**

I think it would be beautiful if there was some kind of ‚Äúreporting‚Äù back to the community. This could be a summary of the votes of the past, feedback the delegate got in the process (cause the delegate will likely be in touch with other delegates), information about other delegates that have a similar stance as we are and generally things the delegate thinks are important.The goal would be to learn what delegates have learned and allow for some ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù for interested members. This reporting could be a written report, but maybe some delegates would also be open to join the weekly EVM meeting in Discord.

**Step 5: Evaluation and (re)delegation**

The last step is evaluating the delegate‚Äôs actions and potentially redelegation. In a best case scenario the evaluation just results in‚Ä¶ nothing. People are happy, feel that the delegate did a great job and represented this community well. But we obviously have to accept that this won‚Äôt be true all the time. Redelegation could happen if a member goes inactive, votes/acts against the community's values/ interest, etc.To be honest I don‚Äôt know how often this should be done, maybe once a year and whenever there are big decisions? In the end this is what some members have been documenting the past couple of days with external delegates and changes in reputation.

1. A snapshot of all LST holders listed above, any that get added, and current Restakers will be taken on Oct 20th.
2. Each wallet gets 1 vote for every $USD worth of tokens staked.
3. LST teams will showcase their merits, declare pre-commitments, and campaign over the next week.
4. LSTs that accumulate more than 15k ETH in votes will be added to EigenLayer for restaking in the subsequent months, added by the number of votes from highest to lowest.Key Dates:ü´∞Snapshot: Oct 20thüìù Submissions by LSTs: Oct 20th-25thüó≥Ô∏è Voting by LST holders: Oct 25th - Nov 1

* AnkrETH (mixed)
* LsETH (no)
* mevETH (no)
* EthX (mixed)
* vETH (unsure)
* oETH (mixed, index)

It seems the one we should support the most is Stakewise's SETH2, so if anyone has that you should set a reminder to vote starting October 25th. Unfortunately there's only a supply of 85k ETH since their old v2 implementation has been paused, so there's limited voting power.

But the good thing is that you can also vote if you have any ETH restaked. I've reached out to Diva to petition for their inclusion.

<summary>u/TheCryptosAndBloods calls out Uniswap for their recent bold move</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/179qkqi/daily_general_discussion_october_17_2023/k59qb89/)

Have we done the new UNI fee stuff?

How Uniswap Labs (the VC funded company) is adding a 0.15% fee to the (primary) frontend it controls, as well as their wallet app? It's 3x the long awaited fee switch for UNI token holders, going entirely to benefit the company. 

And they have announced it the day after they pushed through a vote approving $50 million in funding (by dumping the UNI token) for the Labs company by the Uniswap Foundation/DAO - with zero explanation of what it is for or what it'll be used for - just an opaque ($46 million for 2 years please - we'll use it well, pretty please). 

It's just incredibly brazen. Uniswap is a fantastic product but my god the incentive misalignment between the team and VCs (who want to drive value to the company equity which they own more of and which has fewer regulatory hassles) and token holders is crazy (team and VCs also own a ton of UNI of course but they own more of the company and would prefer to monetize the company, especially since it doesn't have regulatory hassles for them like the token - BUT, they will use their voting power to block any attempts to turn the fee switch on for UNI holders, to avoid aforesaid regulatory hassles for them - all while disingenuously talking about how UNI holders can vote to turn on the fee switch if they want). 

Why do people hold UNI anymore after the relentless screwing of token holders by the team/VCs/company?

Like I said - Uniswap is a great product but the team/VC/founders leave awful taste in the mouth with their greed and screwing of token holders. Also there were some very unpleasant allegations about Hayden screwing over early investors and people who helped him bootstrap and not giving them the equity they were promised etc last year - think there was a long Twitter thread by Ric Burton? I think I need to emphasize that we only heard Ric Burton's side of the story and every story has two sides, but it all sounded quite plausible and in line with the kind of ethos that Uniswap Labs has now..

<summary>u/superphiz self-examines Ethereum's current situation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17aimuj/daily_general_discussion_october_18_2023/k5drhi1/)

Self-examination is critical for long term success. Everyone has been in the dumps about the ratio, but instead of lamenting it we ought to be asking what we can do to improve Ethereum. 

Maybe it's not our fault. Doesn't matter. 

Maybe bitcoin just had the first mover advantage. Doesn't matter. 

Maybe the value is flowing into bitcoin because they'll have the first spot etf. Doesn't matter.

What DOES matter is what the Ethereum community and developers are doing in the face of that. Ethereum is 10x more technically sound than bitcoin, so what can we do to stop suffering through the leak?

We can celebrate our victories and focus on the path forward. 

* The social layer has shown [incredible resilience](https://twitter.com/lidodominance) in the face of a centralizing LSD. 

* Our L2 capacity strategy is [really paying off](https://milkroad.com/layer-2/) with a rich garden of successful L2 chains like arbitrum, optimism, polygon, zksync, base.. all of which are developing their own ecosystems that feed growth back to Ethereum.

* We have quickly moved on from the success of the merge, but let me remind you that we hotswapped our consensus mechanism to improve the operation of the network AND we [reduced energy consumption by 99.99%](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ethereum-s-99-cut-in-energy-use-will-curb-crypto-s-climate-footprint-72145342). We ought to be writing this with sharpie markers in every bathroom stall in the world.

* The [EIP 1559 fee burn mechanism](https://ultrasound.money/) is a complete success. Sure, we're not ultrasound _right now_ but that burned Ether is gone forever and the exercise in implementing EIP 1559 solidified our ability to develop and improve sound monetary policy.

* WE are the chain of innovation and new growth. Practically everything new that's happening is happening on Ethereum. The [Eth killers have all passed away](https://cryptofees.info/) and bitcoin doesn't have the technical ability to do the things that a smart contract platform can do.

* We're [slowly moving closer to a US legal framework](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/investigation-fraud-and-risk/crypto-regulation/) that supports the foundations of cryptocurrency. I acknowledge that it's slow af, but it's definitely moving in a favorable direction.

Now. What are you celebrating? What have I missed? What can we do better? THESE are the questions we need to ask as we accept agency over our current situation.

*Zeus brought her to Earth to be Ethereum's‚Äô wife. He was taken with her beauty and wanted to marry her, despite his developer's warnings of the god's trickery.*

*As a wedding present, Zeus gave TheCommunity a box, telling her never to open it. But as Zeus knew, TheCommunity was degen, she couldn‚Äôt stay away from the box and the urge to open it overcame her. Terrible things flew out of the box: centralization, MEV, scams, Bitcoin maxis, disinformation, LSTs, charlatans, and exploits. All of life‚Äôs miseries let out into the world.* 

*As quick as she could, TheCommunity slammed the lid of the box back down. The last thing remaining inside of the box was Hope.*

*Ever since, Ethereans have been able to hold onto this hope in order to survive the wickedness that TheCommunity had let out.*

<summary>u/TheHansGruber shares their last week of validating on the Holesky testnet</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17098wb/daily_general_discussion_october_5_2023/k3kqc57/)

1 week of holesky testnet operations. 50 thousand genesis validators split across 15 or so giga nerds from the rocketpool discord. I have several thousand running on a Ryzen 5 5560U, 32GB @ 3200, 2TB NVME. CPU is tuned to 25W in the bios. I've got the wattmeter hooked up now and will be monitoring total system usage and see what it averages out to. Goal is to tune as low as possible without borking something. Current usage is about 37w, but it just booted back up and is syncing. Mainnet NUCs are around 15w. Still, kinda crazy to think one could secure $150,000,000 worth of the ethereum network...for 37 watts. It's like...a medium sized solar panel and battery/inverter setup could do this for years. Greenpeace eat your heart out.

Something I didn't consider before operating this node was the time it takes to load keys. It's basically instantaneous with a couple validators. With several thousand it takes 30+ mins. Gotta reboot? It's 30+ mins before everything is kosher again. Ethstats not reporting? A quick eth docker down/up cycle takes 10 seconds. But then 30+ minutes to load the keys. Actually, this makes me think I should try just restarting the execution container instead of the whole shebang and see if that works for ethstats. I am still learning the ins and outs of ethdocker...but it is definitely one of the easiest ways to run a node at home.

Sync aggregation is climbing and nearing 90%. It was hanging out in the 70's last week.

I have started tracking the data usage now as well. With 1.4 million + total validators on the network, rx and tx is way, *way* up. Initial estimates are several TB per month, even with not a lot of activity on the network yet.

Mainnet nodes are around or under 1TB/month, depending on max peers and whatnot. 

Random side note: about an hour ago one of /u/superphiz's validators proposed a 3 eth block....straight to the smoothie pool. Thanks phiz! My non proposing, freeloading minipools appreciate the help.

If you own any ARB, I'd urge you to vote in the LIDO grant proposal - [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6b89b74c259d2cc5979c46be6cfe2ae20f9485eee728a628f56930db644da985](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6b89b74c259d2cc5979c46be6cfe2ae20f9485eee728a628f56930db644da985)

I know DAO governance isn't very sexy, but it's really just going to take 2 minutes of your time for something I know the majority of this sub feels strongly about. The TL;DR is that Lido is looking to get ARB from one of the grant programs running. They are requesting 4 Million ARB - which is about $3.6 million dollars worth today. Essentially to use it to increase liquidity of the their liquid staking token on the Arbitrum chain. I am voting no (I listed why on the forum, I'd link but it's blocked on Reddit), for reasons I'm sure you can all guess. But I'll also add their request is for 8% of the entire grant program (was 10%, they lowered it after a ton of negative feedback). 

Also, reposting a request from earlier in the week - [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16xno81/comment/k34vggy/). Simply wanted to get it at a different time of the day / before the weekend in case it was missed before due to timing.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard describes economic coercive systems</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/172qnoh/daily_general_discussion_october_8_2023/k40w03z/)

I've written several times about [economic coercive systems](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination) before. I'm trying to polish a more simple way to introduce this concept and how blockchains help form these systems.

To start with, let's create an evil smart contract whose only goal is to grow the set of participants in it. The only thing we need for this to work is a way of turning money into something universally unpleasant to a target actor. In the simplest case I'll just suggest an assassination contract. Next, we create an evil conspiracy of initial participants to fund this contract. All the contract has to do is target some unlucky sap who isn't in the contract yet, inform them of a pending assassination contract, and tell them to join us or die. Joining us includes streaming money to the contract so that the contract can grow faster. If the target dies, then the ratio of participants to non-participants still marginally increases. Now we run this until everyone remaining is in compliance with the contract rules.

This describes a minimum viable memetic rule system. The penalty obviously doesn't have to be assassination. It just has to be enough that for whomever the current target is, they are incentivized to join according to their objective function. The penalty I describe in my human coordination post is economic isolation rather than assassination.

The initial participants expose themselves to economic pain from the fees they pay to the contract. This is the cost of expanding the size of the network and punishing defection. The value-add of this cost depends on the value of each new participant of the network. Due to [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) we expect a super-linear value-add for each new participant as the network grows. Therefore, there is critical mass of initial participants required to bootstrap such a solution, but once that is reached the stable equilibrium of the system is to dominate.

Contrast this to networks that tend to fall apart or fail to achieve their goals because there is no leverage against defectors. For example, boycotts fail to work because all the negative consequences are directed at the seller, not at anyone defecting from the boycott. Strikes fail when scabs are brought in whom the strikers have no leverage against. A blockchain solution can have universal leverage because it acts on the unified monetary rail, which is quite unique.

Now, in this simple evil smart contract, there is no inherent value to the network (Metcalf value f(n) = 0). But in economic systems, there is. We can layer other rules into this base memetic rule system that can result in a net positive situation for the initial actors on a long enough horizon. The rules can include things like environmental protection, nuclear disarmament, or UBI.

Once widely adopted, the result is a class of fail-deadly system that punishes both those that disregard the coercive rules and those who don't participate in punishing said defectors. There will always be some players like North Korea who choose to try to go it alone. The goal of an economic coercive system is to try to make them as poor and disconnected as possible to either minimize the harm they can do or compel them to join the coercive network and play by its rules.

Btw, if my evil contract sounds insane, it's basically just taxation + the police that enforce taxation by throwing you in jail instead of killing you. If you say you'd never join such as system, you already *have* joined such a system.

<summary>u/superphiz outlines his staking values</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/173jl7e/daily_general_discussion_october_9_2023/k47jutf/)

A few days ago I shared [Diva's vampire attack against Lido](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/172qnoh/daily_general_discussion_october_8_2023/k3zzk1m/) and someone asked what my incentives were. It got me thinking why people are skeptical of my motives when the things I share seem so obvious to me. It causes me to realize that the criteria I evaluate projects with may not be as clear to everyone as they are to me, and I wanted to de-mystify that by sharing the ways I look at staking projects. I've been developing these ideas since around 2018, so they're old hat to me, but I want you to have the same framework I have.

**Alignment** - Is the product aligned with the success of Ethereum, or is it a "business proposition"? This can be REALLY hard to figure out, but I pretty much listen to the first words out of a project lead's mouth: Are they talking about improving Ethereum or maximizing TVL & profit? The answer to these questions tell whether a project is a public good or a windfall opportunity for investors. I **DO** support investor rewards, but they ought to be within reason, and the ultimate benefactor should be the network and its users.

**Longevity** - I look for projects that have been around long enough to know what they're getting into. This is why I'm a terrible angel investor. Young projects don't have this acumen, and I'm not smart enough to determine whether they'll develop it in time. Longevity is one of the reasons I continue to support Stakewise - they've continued to grow and develop their product over many years.

**Permissionless Node Operation** - This is a HUGE requirement for me. Growth of the Ethereum network requires that as many as people as possible run validators and nodes, and I only support projects who allow any person who is willing to put up a bond, or split a Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT) validator to participate. I believe that successful staking platforms should encourage home node operation and provide multi-client support so that the operator can choose from any consensus or execution client pair.

**Operators must have a stake** - Operators need to have skin in the game, this means that if they're staking for an Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) they ALSO need to have their own Ether on the line. This is because staking is actually a voting process on the network. If an operator doesn't have any stake, they're getting paid regardless of whether the network thrives or fails, but if they have Ether locked in that validator they're far more likely to make decisions that benefit the network. 

**Self-Limiting** - Any project I get excited about must support a self-limit to 22%. I don't care if they'll never get there, this is basically a commitment to say, "We're going to put the success of Ethereum above all else." 

**Minimal Complexity** - I'm deterred by extreme complexity, and adding complexity increases smart contract risk and lowers the odds that people will figure out how it works. Now, to be honest, some projects APPEAR to be complex because they're doing something new, but they may be doing this in the most simple way possible. I have to confess that if I hear inclusion of an NFT in a staking pool scheme I'm generally turned off due to complexity.

**Fully Trustless** - Staking funds need to be controlled end-to-end by a smart contract, not any form of multisig. This means that when you enter as a permissionless validator, your funds are received and managed by smart contract logic that delegates other people's Ether to you, and when you exit, those Ether need to be returned to a smart contract that distributes them fairly. This process ought to be as transparent as possible. This DOES add REAL smart contract risk, but it's superior to human controlled wallets.

**Open Source** - Staking platforms should release code for public audit and as a public good. Our core values include open source software and we must adhere to this as we grow.

So, yeah. These are my values and the ways I evaluate a staking platform. It's why my list is so short, currently I support Rocket Pool, Diva, and Stakewise v3. You may be right to point out that my high standards have enabled shady operators to expand more quickly than quality operators can proliferate, but if we're going to build a healthy network the community and stakeholders must choose the best providers.

In 1732 the world's most populous city* was Ayutthaya in what is now Thailand, with a population estimated at 1 million. It was the seat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which reigned from 1351 to 1767. 

The city could support such a large population because of the prodigious rice production just up the Chao Phraya River. The kingdom was a maritime power that traded surplus grain for luxuries and finished goods, establishing itself as one of the three great powers of Asia alongside Vijayanagar and China.

By 1732, however, its political power was in a slow decline and the capital was destroyed after a 14-month seige by the Burmese. Today, Phra Nakhom Si Ayutthaya is home to 50,830 people and a UNESCO world heritage site in the old city.

* World urban macrodynamicist George Modelski estimated Ayutthaya's population at 1 million in 1700. It's not universally accepted or even knowable what would have been the most populous city in 1732.

Diva has launched two community votes that will have a great bearing on their future:

1. [Self-limiting Diva](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/proposal/44802814205789959072230810924382136907393872780309912200640771189684983862410) - Should DIVA self-limit to 22%? As a living network, most aligned parties recognize the value in maintaining a healthy balance of operators. This stewardship reduces the viability of attacks and increases the long term resilience of the network. Providers who adopt self-limiting signal their alignment with Ethereum.

2. [Adopt Diva Staking DAO Community Guidelines](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/proposal/83348890401949751744687944216855884103596472682649172974139622969919584955539) - These are general guidelines for how the DIVA DAO ought to work, these guidelines make great sense to me and I support them.

You may also be interested to know that DIVA is in the process of vampiring stake away from the largest LST as Danny Ryan suggested [in this very valuable talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ddkSa1ZuI) with /u/evanvanness.

[u/18boro](https://reddit.com/u/18boro):

Diva, the ETH staking protocol,  initiated an interesting vault a few days ago, where you can deposit ETH, or even better, stETH, and accumulate diva as well as the underlying rewards that's included in stETH. When diva officially launches the stETH will be converted to divaETH ,or whatever they decide to call it, hopefully not dETH :). It's a sort of vampire attack on stETH, which we obv need more of. So if you sit on stETH, wash off your sins with this one simple trick.  The protocol hasn't officially launched yet and there is no UI which shows your farming rewards and such. The short story is, stakers are divided in tranches based on how early they are, and the earlier tranches receive more diva per ETH/stETH staked than the later. This is obviously risky, it is a novel protocol, but at least the staking is done through enzyme, which has existed several years already.   


Here is the staking UI: [https://diva.enzyme.finance/#vaults](https://diva.enzyme.finance/#vaults)

I know there is a high chance relays at one point will be gone, cause they will be enshrined. But this will not happen any time soon. So we need relays for some more years, but they don't make any money. 

In my opinion relays = public goods. Public goods need funding. Who can we turn to to get some grants to make sure we can keep or even increase the number of relays? Which protocols have (retroactive) public goods funding? Which delegates do we have to pressure to get funds? What else can we do to improve the situation?

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) and I run the aestus relay. 

I agree - relays are probably here to stay in some form for years. While enshrined PBS would be great, it's worth reiterating Auston's point: making it unbypassable by design is a highly desirable goal. 

MEV is a latency game, and centralised MEV platforms like relays are likely to always have a latency advantage over an in-protocol gossip network. This delta in latency is a delta in profit, and so if ePBS can't ever compete with out of protocol PBS (relays, SUAVE, etc), excepting significant adoption by staking pools (etc) seems unrealistic. At that point it's utility in the protocol is somewhat compromised. 

My sense is that the EF and community are unlikely to move forward until we find a design that meets this unbypassability requirement. It may well be that the current line of research has truly reached a dead end and a fresh approach is required. Unfortunately, It also creates problems for related ambitions such as MEV-burn. 

Central public goods funding in the relay space is fraught with administrative and political complexity. Views over censorship are particularly tricky and fundraising is a bit of a nightmare. 

On one hand, Aestus is a relatively baby relay - on the other, we are regularly responsible for ~3% of Ethereum blocks. Who should pay to keep our lights on? It may be that relays need to form a market and charge a modest fee to validators. I'd be intrigued to know what ethfinance think about that.

`--network holesky` on ethereumjs now uses the correct genesis, but still seems to be failing to serve deposit logs.  
  
I ended up deleting and recreating the slashing protection database for web3signer in postgres.  Having already configured the same validators using web3signer on Holesky v1, none of my validators were able to start attesting when they became active.  
  
Spotted a bug on beaconcha.in.  In the `Attestation Assignments` mouseover for the validator, `Executed` includes the two `Scheduled` slots.  This was easy to spot when several of my Holesky validators have yet to attest.  


I will eventually need to upgrade my storage array for Holesky, but more pressingly, I probably need to upgrade my CPU.  With 30 client pairs, the 15 minute load average on my Threadripper 3960X is consitently well above the recommended one-per-thread of 48.  
  
A lot has happened in the last ~36 hours, and there are probably several notable things I'm forgetting right now.  I need a nap.

<summary>u/benido2030 is rallying the community around public goods funding!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2p2x9p/)

I *really* believe in this community. It's my favorite place and I love the people writing and reading. But I feel we can do more, if we improved coordination. There is so much (financial, vocal, emotional) power that we are not really using yet. 

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) both announced that [Blocknative has shut down their MEV relay and explained why it's concerning](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16tbda8/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2023/k2gb47e/). Blocknative's Matt Cutler basically explained the reasons for this in this [Empire podcast episode](https://blockworks.co/podcast/empire/4ee75432-5c0b-11ee-9ac4-d31bf67ceb24). It comes down to "relays don't make money, but cost money" (and Blocknative is a company with investors that expect returns - and relays have negative returns). 

So what are relays and why are they important? Relays are important for PBS aka proposer builder separation, MEV capturing and specifically for MEV-boost. MEV is every everywhere. Users make transactions and generate MEV opportunities. These transactions are analyzed by searchers, who insert (e.g. add before or after the tx) their own transactions and forward them to builders. Builders collect all tx (from searchers, but also the public mempool) and build blocks with the highest value. Builders then basically forward the blocks to validators (via MEV-boost, a solution outside of the protocol) including the ETH denominated reward they are willing to pay if there block is chosen/ proposed. This is where relays come into play. They relay the blocks and make sure the validator gets paid and the network can't be attacked. As basically always in Ethereum, decentralization is key, so we need multiple relays. PBS doesn't work without relays, but there are no revenues, no revenue share, no nothing for relay devs/ operators. Searchers, builders and validators make money, relays are basically the only infra in the MEV supply chain that we expect to work without getting paid. 

There are some theories why a small fee wouldn't work (builders would only use free relays, hence relays with a rev-cut would be excluded most of the time etc.). So in my opinion (retroactive) public goods funding (PGF) is the best way to get it done. 

Here's where this sub comes in! I would like to

\- use this communities knowledge to identify potential sources for PGF

\- see if we as a community can influence how funding/ grants are distributed (e.g. if governance tokens we all own can vote for an application)

\- use our voices to spread the word about the importance of relays and why funding is essential 

&#x200B;

For example there is [Optimism's RPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf). If Ethereum doesn't work, OP as an ETH L2 doesn't work. In my opinion it's a nobrainer that [u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) and [u/kudeta](https://reddit.com/u/kudeta) (who run the aestus relay) should receive OP funding, but we all know that's not how it works. But if our OP delegates ([u/liberosist](https://reddit.com/u/liberosist), [u/_weboftrust](https://reddit.com/u/_weboftrust), [u/minimalgravitas](https://reddit.com/u/minimalgravitas), [u/pseudotheos](https://reddit.com/u/pseudotheos) and more) coordinated, I am sure their voices can make a change. 

I have no idea how the EVM treasury is doing, but maybe we as EVMs can come together and think about ways to support relays in general and the aestus relay specifically. 

[u/kudeta](https://reddit.com/u/kudeta): You said yesterday that applying for all these grants and funding was complex and a lot of effort. If you want me to help, I am more than happy to e.g. sign-up in the name of the aestus relay for the OP RPGF round 3 and / or gitcoin grants. I have never done something like that, so it might not be perfect but of course I would coordinate with you to make sure the aestus relay is presented in the correct way (on every level). Obviously this would be completely free for you.

<summary>u/MinimalGravitas wants to see some more community pushback and comments on the Lido Arbitrum grant proposal</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2p3xc3/)

Paging [u/bob-rossi](https://reddit.com/u/bob-rossi), [u/dmihal](https://reddit.com/u/dmihal) and any other Arbitrum delegates.

I'm interested in seeing some commentary from EthFinance's representatives over on the Arbitrum governance forum with regards to the request from Lido for 5 million ARB tokens to, as hanniabu so perfectly puts it, *bankroll Lido‚Äôs attack on the network.*

Using the influence we have across different DAOs seems like a simple no-brainer way we can help protect Ethereum from capture. We held off their proposal on Optimism last year, I would love to see the same again this time.

[Insert stirring backing track, e.g. [*From Hell To Glory* by End of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcnJD7q1YZc)]

If you don't want your DAO to pay to incentivize the growth of Lido then now is the time to say so.

This is a moment when governance can really matter. When the social layer actually has a decent amount of power. When *you* can make a difference to the future of this ecosystem.

It takes some courage to put yourself in the firing line, to voice an opinion against one of the most powerful entities in Ethereum. It maybe feels like a foolhardy risk to stand in the way of a juggernaut worth billions of dollars, but the alternative is that everyone rolls over and lets the credible neutrality of our network be stolen away, and with it will go the possible future of Ethereum as the base layer for not just the financial system but for global coordination.

We must not let Moloch win.

The cold war with Lido will be long and hard, and this is just one of many battles, but it is the one we can impact now, and it is one we can win.

Ultimate victory depends on us not losing every battle. It depends on us not giving up anything without a fight. And we must be victorious, because in the long run, without victory there can be no survival for the dream of a future that Ethereum represents.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

It is even better, almost any address can be a burn address. You just have to proof that you know a short number whose hash is equal to the public address. This means there is no possibility for the sender to be sanctioned as there is no on chain proof that the address you sent ETH to is a burn address. The receiver side is a different story, there it is as far as I know obvious that the funds received used this scheme. The last all core devs call had a longer discussion about it and one person advocated to be more cautious and not to use these kind of zk circuits on L1 just yet as they are rather untested and previous iterations of similar schemes had bugs. In the longer run this scheme is definitely so amazing and I am a big believer that privacy needs to be part of the base layer.

For those confident we'll have another bullrun, what will drive the eth price up? Previously we had ICOs, then defi/yield farming and then NFTs. Is there anything left? Also fees will be lower due to L2s which may actually be negative for the eth price unless L2 activity goes 100x.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16i99gu/daily_general_discussion_september_14_2023/k0iq5lk/)

ethfinance activity seems to be in a bear market as well and the crab gets to some people. Nevertheless, I still am very positive about the next few months in Ethereum. Here are a few things I am looking forward to:

- Holesky testnet. This is a replacement for the Goerli testnet. It will have 1.4 million genesis validators to start and individuals can spin up their own ones later on. Genesis is tomorrow (Friday) at 14:00 UTC. I set up my 2 nodes and distributed my 2500 genesis validators to them. One is running nethermind/nimbus on an ARM minicomputer with 100 validators, The other one is a much more powerful ASUS PN51 running besu/teku with 2400 validators. I am curious if these 2 machines are able to manage the heavy load of the larger validator set and contribute to a stable holesky testnet. I am only slightly nervous.
  
- Diva testnet. Diva is a DVT (distributed validator technology) liquid staking protocol and they are testing their stuff on the Goerli testnet at the moment. I have a node up for a few weeks now, but they needed to improve their software to get rid of some bottlenecks. Waiting until the new release drops for dappnode users and then I can finally play around with it. It is an alpha testnet, so I am not expecting Diva to have a market ready product this year, but I think it is one of the more promising LST projects out there.
  
- Gnosis Pay: Waiting for my debit card to be sent out. Hopefully in a month or two I will get it. I just like the idea having a direct channel between my tokens and the real world to buy stuff and send fiat onto the chain. I am really interested how the UX will be and if they managed to create a seamless experience. I am a bit worried about all my purchases being tracked on chain for everyone to see. I personally am curious if the self 'custodial bank account' or the 'privacy nightmare' narrative will win for me here.
  
- Dencun upgrade. Massively reducing the cost of transactions on rollups is gonna be quite interesting to see. At first probably the most stupid but fun dapps will dominate. With time, new applications will come out to truly take advantage of the cheaper blob space on Ethereum. The upgrade will not happen in the next few weeks, but there is steady progress. Some last minute additions are still being considered, but to me it looks like people are heads down working on it. Hopefully by the end of this year we will have it.
  
- Rollups/L2 will rule the world. We have seen quite a few new rollups in the last few months: Linea, Base, zkSync Era, zkEVM, mantle, zora, public goods network, worldcoin. There are now over 30 L2s lised on L2Beat. But not only new rollups pop up. Existing chains switch to an optimistic rollup: Celo pretty much decided to become an optimistic rollup, fantom started a similar discussion. Also gnosis chain is looking into ways to become an L2 (a validium, not a rollup) to Ethereum. It looks like the next narrative might be having the best rollup/L2 on top of Ethereum and not so much an creating another Ethereum killer. I am really looking forward to what the rollup/L2 landscape will look like in a year.
  
- Eigenlayer: In a few months we will probably see if Eigenlayer is more than just a bunch of convincing powerpoint slides and a charismatic speaker. We will see if they have actual product market fit and enough demand for their ideas. There are already some interesting developments with the espresso sequencers and the already started mantle L2. Even though I am not sure how mantle can use EigenDA if Eigenlayer is not much more than a restaking smart contract at the moment. In a few months we will see. I am also curious how Eigenlayer will tackle centralisation issues.

<summary>u/nixorokish breaks the news of the staking deposit churn limit EIP being included in the next hard fork</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16i99gu/daily_general_discussion_september_14_2023/k0ldob9/)

The decision was made during the ACD call today to include EIP-7514 in Dencun, which sets a max churn limit for the *activation* queue (note: does not affect the exit queue). 

What's been happening up until now is that the more validators that are in the set, the faster they can get added (the math is here: <https://benjaminion.xyz/eth2-annotated-spec/phase0/beacon-chain/#get_validator_churn_limit>). 

This keeps the network stable and makes the size of the validator set somewhat predictable. Since the validator set has been growing *a lot* since Shapella, this number is getting bigger and bigger and the network is growing faster and faster. EIP-7514 caps the number of validators that can be added each epoch at 8.

I believe that there could be some controversy about this over the next few days because it was created and added quickly but Dankrad published a post today on why he supports it and he says everything more eloquently and with more context than I could, so have a read of his post here: <https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/churn-limit>

<https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7503>

This EIP is interesting. 

Base layer privacy is definitely something that's needed for adoption imo. Especially as forensic tools and tracking get better over time and transaction data remains on-chain forever it will be easier to dox and link wallets. Hard to see regular people wanting to use Ethereum if that's the case. 

Private ETH defs a good thing but maybe this EIP will introduce some additional risk (minting and burning ETH at base layer might have previously unthought of attack vectors). I'm not big brained enough to interrogate the code.

Anyone here have some thoughts on this EIP?

Twitter scams are getting more and more elaborate.

The latest one is where they create a fake @MetaMask twitter account, then take a *whole month* to build up their post history by copying every post of the real MetaMask account. During this month, they also gradually build their follower count through bots. Of course, Twitter does not detect any of this activity as suspicious because they have entirely lost the plot.

If you were to glance at the twitter account, you'd see an account with tens of thousands of "followers" and a post history that scrolls on and on for many pages. Looks pretty damn close to the real MetaMask account.

Stay safe.

Gary Gensler is what is wrong with America. Here we have a man, who clearly has a good grasp on blockchain as evidenced by his history teaching it at MIT. Yet despite this, he decides to completely contradict his previous teachings in favour of at best furthering his own personal political ambitions and at worst outright corruption in an effort by an invisible hand to stamp out crypto.

Classic 4th turning and fall of empires stuff right here. The ubiquity of wealth and excess surrounding him and his generation throughout their lifetime has left those that wish to participate in politics and influence devoid of values upon which his once great nation was built. In place of these values are the primal instincts of greed, power, pleasure and self preservation which are the fruits which can be attained from corrupting such rich and powerful institutions. These people are devoid of morals and will lead us down the path towards authoritarianism and collapse as seen time and time again throughout history, Rome and Weimar Germany being the most obvious.

In short, fuck you Gary, this is all your fault.

^(Obviously there is a degree of hyperbole here as there are other factors at play too like demographics, but at the same time the writing is on the wall and despite having learned from history, I can‚Äôt wait to watch it play out in a very similar way again thanks to those who haven‚Äôt learned from history.

Yo ETH fam! I've been away from crypto for a few months, but not like I expect you to remember me. Today I've been scanning L2 landscape changes, DeFi and airdrop hunting possibilities.

Base took off fast, my golly. First in TPS today, third in TVL. How did that come about? Did they mention an airdrop? How stable is it? I get that fraud proofs are not developed yet.

I'm a fan of single-side LPing. No impermanent loss for me, thank you very much for offering. I see there are some new possibilities for it on zkSync Era: EraLend, Reactorfusion, ZeroLend. Cool! APY on ETH and USDC is <2%, but it's nice to park some spare tokens, waiting for an airdrop.

Rhino.fi surprised me pleasantly. 10% APY on ETH in one pool. Left some ETH there a few months ago - I'm not disappointed.

I'd like to use this opportunity to thank Optimism! 

I see it's a bit gloomy in here. As somebody who's been in the game for quite a while now - **this is the easiest bear ever**! We are above 2018 ATH ^^if ^^you ^^ignore ^^inflation. But most importantly, development is phenomenal! L1s becoming L2s on Ethereum! You mentioned Canto, Celo, Fantom, Gnosis yesterday. Just waiting on Solana and Cardano to pull the trigger. Ethereum has become what it promised to be. Front page of L2beat is a thing of beauty! We are cemented, baby! This may very well kill *ETH killer* narrative in the next bull.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard continues his detailed discussion of governance tokens</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16mhwki/daily_general_discussion_september_19_2023/k18huxd/)

I wrote [recently](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16c6vpw/daily_general_discussion_september_7_2023/jzk2o58/) about multicameral governance designs. The responses that have come up in response to that post have taken 2 forms:

1) Isn't this going to devalue the governance token? What is the point of a governance token that only has a minority power over governance? I talk about that [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16fmfto/daily_general_discussion_september_11_2023/k02q0ue/).

2) Voter participation sucks and we need to concentrate power to make anything work around here. Let's dive in to that.

Most DAOs today have a voter participation rate of less than 20%. Even when delegation is supported the delegates themselves aren‚Äôt all particularly great at participation and need a cat herder to get much done. The exceptions to this rule are DAOs where there are regular votes and where voters get paid extra by voting.

Two examples that come to mind for this are Kyber Network and Curve. Kyber Network directly rewards voter participation. You can see the rewards for current and past votes [here](https://kyberswap.com/kyberdao/vote). Curve is a bit more indirect in that only a subset of governance decisions come with monetary compensation and that compensation is indirect through bribes. This one is a more complicated topic I dive into a bit [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing/).

An interesting footnote about the Curve participation is the ve system and admin fees that are optimized by pairing veCRV with liquidity has led to liquid lockers (yCRV, sdCRV, cvxCRV, etc) to optimize revenue. These liquid lockers have a side effect of concentrating voting power. As a consequence of that Curve has outstanding voter participation amongst its tokens but a relatively low Nakamoto coefficient.

One clear lesson that stands out from both of the above examples is voters participate better if there are regular votes that they are paid to show up and participate in. Outside of the obvious incentive alignment that comes with compensating voter participation, voter participation increases when:

1) Voting is cost-minimized

2) Their vote is perceived as being more impactful on the outcome

3) They have something to lose

Drawing a parallel to elections to nation states. US voters are more active when:

1) Their state supports voting by mail and other mechanisms to make voting more convenient

2) They live in a swing state or a state without first-past-the-post electoral college rules

3) They are voting on an issue that affects them more personally (e.g. women vote more actively when abortion is a hot topic). Bribery is seasonal along the same lines (e.g. the NRA donates more when gun rights are a hot topic).

For blockchains, cost minimization is a matter of off-chain message signatures rather than L1 transactions like Maker has. There‚Äôs not much we can do for the second point without concentrating power and sacrificing voter participation but contentious votes having higher participation is a natural phenomenon.

The last thing we can do is create something to lose for each vote. This comes in two flavors. First, we can use bonded KPIs to attach something at stake to each vote. The basic concept of a bonded KPI is simple. You bond your influence against a prediction during a commit round each cycle (e.g. quarterly, yearly, etc). The bonded influence is the only influence eligible to vote. Your vote goes into effect immediately but your prediction is kept secret during the cycle. At the end of the cycle, everyone reveals their prediction by posting a decryption key. Then a decentralized one-shot oracle like UMA provides a value for the metric. The bonded influence is redistributed based on the relative accuracy of everyone‚Äôs predictions. Finally everyone claims their influence from the bonded KPI and the next cycle begins. The result is that influence will trend towards those best at making predictions. I suggest the skill of making accurate predictions is correlated with competence at voting well. When combined with a value-aligning selection criteria for initial influence to bond, we end up solving the stated goal of selecting a rational, informed, value-aligned set of voters that vote on the most important issues of the day.

This system breaks down where someone can have enough influence over the metric to predict that very bad things will happen, ensure they do, and be rewarded for doing so. This is similar to how ‚Äúassassin‚Äù prediction markets work or why we don‚Äôt let athletes bet to lose their own match. In that case I‚Äôd suggest the DAO might just have to dissolve that governing body and form a new one without that bad actor. It‚Äôs a thorny problem for sure.

The second flavor is an inactivity leak for not voting. For tradable tokens this isn't viable unless you somehow ensure all forms of LP token (e.g. Uniswap NFTs, Aave aTokens, etc) are also eligible to vote. However, this system is more viable when influence is not an ERC-20 token. In that case, getting influence in a governing body is a bonus perk of something external to the governing body. Once you're in, unless you‚Äôre doing active work for the governing body your relative influence should decay. In broad terms the active work of a governing body is to continually do the things the issuance selection criteria select for and to vote well. I think it‚Äôs therefore fair that if someone is voting poorly (see KPI above) or not using their voting power regularly they should lose that influence. A DAO is ill-served by having a large voter base of inactive/inattentive voters, even if they delegate. Measuring voting activity is much easier than measuring vote quality.

An implementation of inactivity could resemble something like Ethereum‚Äôs where the higher the percentage of the existing voters are inactive the higher the turnover of influence should be. This creates something of a market-based approach to encourage voter participation. The end result is create higher turnover of the governing body to one consisting of active participants and then to pay them for the hard work of voting well. By the numbers we have, this is how you actually build a DAO and not just a fundraising mechanism.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal summarises a tweet thread on the Lido problem</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16ncizo/daily_general_discussion_september_20_2023/k1es43m/)

This tweet by Ryan Berckmans is a great summary of the Lido situation, in my opinion.

<https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1704192307270975643>

It boils down to two logical inconsistencies:

1) no CEX is in the run to dominate staking. Data doesn't support that theory. To assert it as fact is gaslighting.

2) if a winner-takes-most structure is inevitable, why is Lido spending enormous LDO bribes through the entire ecosystem to this day? 

The data here is even more damning than for CEXes. No LSD is a credible competitor to the tune suggested (a winner-takes-most scenario does not merely imply a competitor would catch up, it would also suggest that competitor's size towers over Lido at least to the current extent Lido towers over the competition).

As long as those logical inconsistencies are core points of the Lido thesis, there is a problem with Lido.

Vitalik's twitter account was hacked. It's all over. Everyone please start panicking.

This is lesser-known, but Ethereum's consensus mechanism depends on a Twitter integration with Vitalik's account, so it's likely the Ethereum chain will halt within a few hours. I don't know if the client teams will be able to implement a workaround for the Twitter dependency in time - Ethereum's Twitter integration was supposed to be removed as a vestigial feature in the Merge fork but I guess the devs didn't get around to it.

I really hope Charles Hoskinson still has access to the manual override key and is willing to use it to recover the chain. The only other person I know of with the Ethereum admin key is Sam Bankman-Fried, and he won't be able to save us this time for obvious reasons.

If we can't get either of those admin keys, we'll have to ask Elon Musk to go into Vitalik's account to turn Ethereum off and back on again for us. Please send thoughts and prayers everyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è

<summary>u/SikhSoldiers points out that Lido is going against one of its core principles set forth by Paradigm</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16d18dh/daily_general_discussion_september_8_2023/jzoblvs/)

It boils my blood that @LidoFinance thinks fit to go against one of the founding lido principles set forward by @paradigm. 

Governance is and always has been the existential risk that Lido presents. Dual governance is a bandaid solution, not any kind of permanent one and is very fallible. 

As long as LDO governance can control the validator registry, LDO should not exceed roughly 33% of the network. There is no hard line here because the threat isn‚Äôt based on any hard line. 

The threat is that LDO slowly gains a subversive power over Ethereum due to its ability to threaten node operators with the boot, a very powerful threat that @gakonst rightfully points out all those years ago. 

The staking router and the coming forced exits upgrades will further exacerbate the issue. Both will increase the power of LDO token holders over the node operators. Forced exits especially worries me as it has been touted as their solution for keeping their permissioned node operators in line. 

Governance is a weakness, the existence of a threat is the problem itself. We cannot rely on LDO holders to be good stewards, not even with stETH veto power. 

The apathy and bureaucracy of DAO governance is too powerful a deterrent for vetos to reliably work. The only solution is to remove the threat completely. 

Georgios goes on to write ‚ÄúIf said pool is sufficiently governance-minimized, it could possibly win the entire market without causing any systemic risk for Ethereum.‚Äù

Where‚Äôs the minimization frens???

ln April of 2022 I published a now deleted thread called ‚ÄúA Case against stETH‚Äù where I explained why neither DVT nor social scores for permisionless node operators would work to scale their node operators set fast enough for the rate that they were growing their stake. 

The entire thread stands true today. The recent @NethermindEth report suggests using a Kleros court to judge Sybil cases. That‚Äôs a joke when nation states are out here human trafficking and dedicating billions to hacking/exploits/evading Sybil detection. If Lido messes up their Sybil implementation, we could find ourselves with 10-15% of all Eth staked sitting in North Korea in a Sybil farm of node operators with 0 capital bond. 

Lido should self limit not because of any consensus attacks, they should self limit because $stETH is growing faster than they can decentralize and research ways to safely introduce permisionless nodes without jeopardizing the network. 

Don‚Äôt let their campaign fool you, @LidoFinance has not shed any of its governance functionality‚Äîin fact it plans on growing it. 

This is the danger of $stETH dominance.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16c6vpw/daily_general_discussion_september_7_2023/jzi3eez/)

**+++ Benido's favorite podcasts episodes +++**  
Some weeks ago I started publishing some podcast recommendations featuring interesting episodes. Since I enjoy podcasts I thought it might be a service to the community to highlight those I really liked (or maybe disliked? Let's see what the future brings). It's not a real summary, so if my thoughts make you curious, you might want to jump in to listen to the full episode. They are always linked in the headline.  
Here is a list of all the past posts:

[Benidos favorite podcasts no.1](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14r0ocb/comment/jqql97w/)

[Benidos favorite podcasts no.2](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1580pwg/comment/jt9qh1v/)

[Benidos favorite podcasts no.3](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15rirbm/comment/jw9ltqc/)

&#x200B;

Now here are the new ones I really liked from the past couple of weeks. Interestingly they are all very technical and let me be honest... I sometimes couldn't really follow the guests/ hosts. I think they are all great, but in these cases I would really recommend taking some dedicated podcast time with 100% focus. 

[Bankless: Scaling Ethereum To The Next Level with zkEVM feat. Justin Drake and Brian Retford](https://bankless.com/scaling-ethereum-to-the-next-level-with-zkevm)

Maybe you remember a post from u/liberosist talking about the different types of zkEVMs there are (I tried to find it but couldn't). This podcast basically talks (partially) about this. Since this is fairly technical topic, it's moderated by Justin Drake and RSA is more or less downgraded to listener. 

This includes how L1 might become a zkEVM in the future based on some of the developments in the L2 landscape and the positive side effects this might have (e.g. lower hardware reqs for validators). 

I think this episode is pretty good and a great addition to the sci-fi roadmap episode from ethcc since it's very forward looking, but in the end this is why we are here, right? 
  
[Epicenter: Frontier Research - Solving Ethereum's MEV Problem feat. Stephane Gosselin](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/511)

This episode is a pretty good one if you are into MEV. Stephane Gosselin was one of the flashbots founders and has left the project some months ago. In this episode he talks a little about the MEV landscape, his impact and how he would rate it (interesting answer here!). On top he gives some insights into his new venture "Frontier Research".

One major topic is RFQ = request for quotes and intents, but they also tackle PBS, MEV burn etc. 

I think you need a pretty decent understanding of MEV to be able to follow this episode. If you do, this is 60 minutes+ of very good content, especially since Stephane knows flashbots, but is not 100% aligned, but going down a new (and much needed?) experimental road. 

[Uncommon Core 2.0 - An Incomplete Guide to PBS feat. Mike Neuder and Chris Hager](https://www.ucc2.xyz/podcast/episode/1bb543a8/an-incomplete-guide-to-pbs-with-mike-neuder-and-chris-hager)

PBS or proposer builder separation has been around since a year or so. This episode features Mike Neuder (from the EF) and Chris Hager (from Flashbots), which is a pretty good panel since it the main parties involved came together. 

The first hour or so is a discussion, the second part is a followup discussion with only Hasu and Jon. My take away: PBS is a design philosophy/ space. What does this mean? When I first learned about it I basically thought PBS was designed, the scope was clear and we only needed implementation. I think the conclusion after this episode is that this is not the case. There are a lot of different implementations possible and it's not even clear if ePBS (enshrined PBS) is the way to go. 

u/eth10kisfud since we talked about MEV burn [yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16bb42v/comment/jzd9by5/). This is the episode that led to my answer.

Benido, this sucks, this is all so technical, why didn't you include a podcast I can just listen to on my way to work or in the gym and if I blink I can just continue listening? Well I am glad you asked, because I got you covered! 

&#x200B;

[Bonus: The Chopping Block - Coinbase‚Äôs Paul Grewal on Why the SEC Is Going After Crypto So Aggressively](https://unchainedcrypto.com/the-chopping-block-coinbases-paul-grewal-on-why-the-sec-is-going-after-crypto-so-aggressively/)

This Chopping Block episode is a pretty good summary about "The SEC vs Crypto and Coinbase". I liked it a lot because I think Paul Grewal is a pretty cool guest (Paul is Coinbase' Chief Legal Officer) and he pretty transparently explains why Coinbase acts in the way it does. 

I am not sure the speculation about Gary Gensler's motivation is the best approach, but the rest of it is a very good summary and includes some industry insights that I think are a very interesting and if you didn't follow as closely this episode is the one you wanna listen to. 

&#x200B;

This is it for today, but I already have picked one podcast episode for the fifth edition! Let's go!

<summary>u/Newman513 talks about methods to mitigate issues from the ever growing validator set</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16d18dh/daily_general_discussion_september_8_2023/jzocbcm/)

See some chatter in here today about the late-stage proposal to limit the validator churn limit for inclusion in Deneb. I've been following this relatively closely since I think that this has the potential to brew into a CAT5 storm for the 250 of us that are terminally online and plugged into Ethereum development drama.

I first became aware of "the issue" during ACD 113 (bad news always comes on the 13th) - tl;dr on the issue (parroting Christine Kim, because she can summarize better than I can):

> A large validator set size is undesirable because this increases the computational burden on validator nodes and creates complications for implementing future code changes such as single slot finality.

> Without a countermeasure in the next 9-10 months to address validator set size growth, @mkalinin2 said that the computational load on nodes could increase 3x with the increased volume of messaging on the networking layer.

What are some possible solutions? 

* Reduce rewards - incentives will reduce the number of validators joining / motivate some to exit
* Cap the # of validators
* Cap the churn limit
* Implement longer-term solutions that actually solve the problem, but require more R&D to design and vet

Looks like option 3 is being pursued in the short-term, if only to buy more time. I think that this is a phenomenal example of just how fragile Ethereum is, and why even 7+ years in it's critical to be mindful of introducing systems on top of the protocol that bring with him considerable unknown unknowns! Think Eigenlayer - love the potential innovation, but a stage-gated slow rollout to understand the intricacies of the interdependencies that new primitives introduce is preferable to me, and I'd argue responsible, particularly when building on top of something so unsteady that's managed to command as much economic importance as Ethereum has since it's inception.

Will get off my soap box - y'all are on the same page. Hopefully the summary & sources are helpful!

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard has another great discussion on DAO governance</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16fmfto/daily_general_discussion_september_11_2023/k02q0ue/)

I wrote [recently](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16c6vpw/daily_general_discussion_september_7_2023/jzk2o58/) about multicameral governance designs. The responses that have come up in response to this post have taken 2 forms:

1. Voter participation sucks and we need to concentrate power to make anything work around here. I'll address that a bit in a different post.
2. Isn't this going to devalue the governance token? What is the point of a governance token that only has a minority power over governance?

I'd like to take a few paragraphs to discuss what I think the rights and responsibilities of permissionlessly tradable governance tokens should be in a multicameral governance structure.

Among most modern DAO designs there is usually a singular governance token. This token usually serves two purposes. The first, as the name implies, is it acts as a force in governance. The second is it serves as a fundraising tool potentially by multiple mechanisms such as ICO, bond, inflation schedules, or call options. There are a few other minor uses as well that I go into [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wliv6s/daily_general_discussion_august_11_2022/ijtvcz1/). When people buy this token they do so with the expectation that they have a claim upon the future profit of the system the DAO governs. Ultimately, greed fueled speculation is what gives governance tokens most of their tradable value.

The abysmal governance participation we see for most DAOs today is a strong indication that the governance power of governance tokens is not the primary source of their demand. Therefore, adopting a multicameral governance structure and diluting this governance power should not overly affect the usefulness of a governance token as a fundraising mechanism.

That said, care must be taken to protect the contractual rights of the governance token for its primary purpose. If clarity on this is not provided, investor confidence will wane, and the DAO will quickly find itself unable to raise funds by issuing tokens. At that point the DAO either must have a self-sufficient product, rely on charity from necessary participants, or watch as necessary participants stop doing their necessary work and the system fails.

One guarantee the DAO can provide to the governance token holders is to escrow the treasury funds directly within the governance token governing body (the capital module). System profit should be automatically sent to the treasury. At minimum, since each governing body controls its own state, this gives the token holders the ability to revoke token approval to these funds to the parent DAO. This guarantees those token holders a contractual right to the treasury should the DAO dissolve or they want to revolt. All they have to do is pass a policy to pay out the treasury to themselves.

Another guarantee the DAO can provide the governance token holders is to make it very difficult for the parent DAO to change any fund flow related policies without their approval. The capital module needs to have confidence that their power over the purse can‚Äôt be whimsically revoked. Different types of proposals in the parent DAO can potentially have different rules required to ratify them. This is also consistent with granting governance power over topics to those it affects the most. The governance token holders are those most affected by changes to monetary flows and should have a greater say on changing certain parameters related to that than other governing bodies. This satisfies a design goal of *fairness*.

The last guarantees all come from the ability of each governing body to maintain its own internal state. The parent DAO can only invoke functions on the governing body contract that it allows. Any control over these matters the capital module grants to the parent DAO are inherently revocable. This gives the capital module ultimate control over the issuance of the governance token and all matters dependent on that such as how to incentivize liquidity depth for the token, how to structure bonds, its inflation schedule, etc.

In summary, it is my belief that so long as the governance token holders have faith in the future revenue of the system and their claim right to it the token should retain value. So long as it has value it can serve its primary purpose as a fundraising mechanism. I don't believe diluting the governance power of these tokens will destroy their value, but I do think it can lead to a DAO that is more resilient and likely to succeed in the long term for reasons stated in my previous post. The main ingredient we're missing to try this somewhere is a guinea pig and a fairly small software package. I think it's a *much* better direction than what Rune is doing to Maker with "neural tokenomics" for example.

<summary>u/somedaysitsdark starts a discussion after a recent block proposal</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16gi7gg/daily_general_discussion_september_12_2023/k0b54e8/)

I posted this to the EVM discord, but figured it would be healthy to blast here too:

I proposed my fourth block recently ü•≥. But because my mev-boost min-bid is set to .05, if I don't receive any bids higher than .05 my client builds the block itself. That is working fine, so far 3/4 of my blocks have been homemade. But, my most recent block had my first tornado cash transaction in it.

I'm just annoyed by regulatory lack of clarity on whether or not I should care as a US operator.

I could run mev-boost with no min-bid and point it at only ofac compliant relays is what the government might say in the future?

What happens eventually once we have proposer builder separation? That's the plan right? I'm not super familiar with how that works.

If US validators 'currently' aren't held to KYC regulations- which I believe is accurate, then we shouldn't care at all even if someone wants to transact with an OFAC-list address? Maybe that is a bad assumption.

If I need to be OFAC compliant, then I need to know for sure. That way I can either just do it, or move my server out of the country? Would that even be sufficient? Even Coinbase still validates non-compliant transactions, or so I've heard, I haven't actually confirmed this. I'm gonna go look.

According to this blurb, they run some validators without mev-boost deliberately to prevent censorship: <https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/news/earn-pbs-enabled-mev-rewards-with-coinbase-cloud>

Prime and retail Coinbase users are opted in to mev-boost automatically btw.

Just starting to peep etherscan to see what the big exchanges are doing:

I'm here. Venue is awesome, probably a little bigger than necessary but it's better to have the space then not. The main talks haven't had any real alpha so far, lots of wagmi and "down bad, haha" talk. The regulatory panel was fun to watch, but again, no pertinent info was learned. It was inferred that for any reasonable change in the regulatory situation, Gary would litteraly have to just wake up on the "right side of the bed" one day. And no one on the panel suggested they thought it was likely. Legislation (in the US) needs to be passed. Rep. Emmer was hopeful on this. 

Swag game has not been as good as ethdenver or devcon. But we are in the depths of the bear, so.....

Rainey street crawl was last night. I'm not a bankless citizen so I didn't go to their closed event. Had a Hella good waygu smash burger at a place across the street though. 

Overall, it's still fun to be spending a few days with so many like minded people in a fun town. Bear market conferences are the best for this reason. Only the *real* degens are here. If any actual news or info is discovered I'll be sure to drop it in here.

Next year's permissionless is on the books for  October 9th-11th 2024 in salt lake city.

I would rather the US not allow spot ETFs than red-tape defi, which is basically what is happening with the proposed rules that are perhaps impossible to follow. ETFs are probably great for price action but they aren't crypto. 

I remember how excited I was in 2020 about synthetic stocks, defi, insurance, gambling and other use cases happening on Ethereum. Now we know that synthetic stocks are a massive regulatory no-no. I am overall happy about what is possible in defi but it looks like all frontends will require KYC in the future (for US users at least). We are lucky that an exception was made for validators. They wanted KYC of all TXs, which is obviously not possible. That's one of my issues, it has become obvious that regulation doesn't come from a fair, logical and neutral point. It's a bit of a circus and impossible to guess what will come.

<summary>u/haurog looks into the future of Gnosis chain</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16hdwk1/daily_general_discussion_september_13_2023/k0f1jg6/)

Some time ago we had a discussion here about gnosis chain and its future. Today I watched two talks from DAPPCON23 by two gnosis developers/researchers. They seem to look into possibilities of becoming a validium L2 to Ethereum. This is all very exploratory and nothing has been set in stone. As far as I understand they could write checkpoints to Ethereum and keep the validators as is for data availability. This seems to need a lot of more work and especially making it trustless seems to be a bit tricky. The approach they are looking into now seems to be more taxing to the validators as they would need also need to be able to verify the Ethereum chain at the same time. There seems to be some ways around it though. Ethereums future looks quite good to me, everyone thinks about becoming a rollup/L2.

The first talk is by Philippe Schommers and talks generally about [the future of gnosis chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYCkV1LjiU&t=6150s) towards the end he talks about [possibilities of turning gnosis chain into an L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYCkV1LjiU&t=6955s). 

The second talk is by dapplion which describes in [detail the approach they are looking into at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYCkV1LjiU&t=14130s). 

I hope the youtube links work as the videos are still streaming youtube seems not to like to link to a timestamp directly. It worked for me.

My biggest issue with this is they could get rich quicker, then flip to control ethereum quicker and or after something goes wrong for them 

You need to add something that stops that possibility imo

Something like locking in some or all of these mega validators stake for that extra reward, so that they are basically in service to eth in order to continue earning rewards to make back their locked stake.

And even with that, that semi only puts the problem back 20-50 years imo 

Mostly thinking about 3% apr (y?) and also they would likely have to pay back their customers?

<summary>u/Syentist explains why he is surprised that there hasn't been more eyebrow raising in response to Maker's recent move which effectively made them an unregistered money market fund</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/167tggf/daily_general_discussion_september_2_2023/jyu5hft/)

Maker has deposited north of $1.2 billion of the $ backing DAI into US treasuries. The yield on the US treasuries is paid back to DAI holders who have deposited to the DSR contract. That is a near text book definition of a [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp), except an unregistered version. 

"But KYC is inherently evil. We should fight it when we can". Ethereum already allows for two people to send and receive ETH with each other (=to transact) without intermediaries and without KYC. But if you are literally investing in a financial instrument offered by the US government, it's hard to understand why we can or should bypass clear cut laws which exist for the rest of the members of society.

And the absence of KYC is only a small part of the problem to me. The bigger part is the pure unregulated nature of this enterprise. Rune is one acid trip in the Himalayas away from suddenly deciding the solution to world inequality is to arbitrarily donate half the USG bonds to some charity. I'm not joking - the Maker core team is, at best, chaotic neutral, with emphasis on chaotic. It's insane for a $4.5bil stablecoin to rely on a group of centralized chaotic actors. And this is where registration of money market funds comes into play. You have designated legal responsibilities to core organisational members who's details are known to the feds, you have clear auditing rules and what can and can't be done with customer funds, and customers have clear legal recourse if or when the custodians behave outside of these narrow rules. Right now, DAI holders get ZERO of those clear cut protections. 

And lastly, NONE of this fits within the original ethos nor objective of Maker, as an Ethereum centric decentralised stablecoin. Nothing in today's Maker is decentralised nor fitting the core ethos of Ethereum, despite the team and the project having leached off credibility from the Ethereum ecosystem to bootstrap themselves to the current position as a major defi protocol. For example if Jump or Binance came up with a protocol with similar shenanigans to that exhibited by Rune and Maker today, it would at best, be a short term pump and dump excercise, not a protocol which attracts and retains billions in TVL over a long term. The only reason Maker manages to do that is because it managed to successfully leach credibility from the Ethereum ecosystem, before pivoting into the present circus. /end rant

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/169imcm/daily_general_discussion_september_4_2023/jz2atmo/)

I‚Äôm trying to understand the current state and the near future of account abstraction. From what I understand, there are two competing standards: the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) architecture and the newer ERC-6900 architecture. Having one standard seems important because it will enable dapps and developers to create plugins/modules for AA wallets (automatic DCA, freeze certain assets, spending limits per ‚Äúsession key‚Äù, etc). 

It‚Äôs very cool and I believe that it has a future (especially on L2s with cheaper fees soon), but which architecture will win? The Safe team is well-respected, but it sounds like ERC-6900 has some advantages. 

Does anyone know the latest? Is the developer mindshare leaning one way right now?

nonsense.

> The counter-argument here is of course that threatening to throttle and/or fork out Lido, if it doesn't adhere to the will of a handful of core devs/researchers/influencers, is the surest way to kill any notion of better and safer property rights

Psyops to convince people that the "will of the people" is to hand over governance to Lido DAO when not even a supermajority of LDO token holders really want this (https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1697610036841726414) - the delegates who vote with the most LDO just overshadow everybody else

Sacha is trying to paint "a handful of core devs/researchers/influencers" as an elite group trying to maintain power. In reality, these are the hundreds of people who are building the Ethereum protocol layer and are trying to make it impossible for *anyone* to capture the Ethereum consensus layer. Like I said, psyops.

> My personal perspective here is that it would be extremely irresponsible for Lido to gain a dominant market share without first significantly improving its resilience to long-term tail-risks -- and reducing the impact of those tail-risks on the Ethereum protocol

"Yeah for sure Lido in its current form shouldn't control Ethereum. But I think it eventually should and will, it just needs some tweaking before it's ready"

> I think it bears repeating here that Lido is not a single entity. It is a co-ordination layer between a multitude of stakers and node operators.

It is 31 operators who can be removed at any point by one entity: the Lido DAO. Which is swung by a few majority delegates. Many operators receive a significant portion of their income from being Lido operators - the threat of losing this income is a source of influence you can't ignore.

---------

Sacha's whole deal is coming up with long-winded posts that masquerade as research to justify Lido DAO governance expansion. Start with a conclusion and build arguments to meet up with it. He writes in a way that often impresses people into thinking it might be a good argument but he never actually gives us new information - he's not looking for an answer or doing research, he's just finding new ways to say "It's okay for Lido to eventually become the middleman between you and Ethereum."

**Staking: Finale**

I'm proud to say that I'm officially a Beacon chain depositor!

I started my journey in late November, early December last year. After researching and getting all the parts and setting up NUC I took quite a long pause. It was still on my mind even though I wasn't following through with that. As I finished addressing more critical priorities in my life earlier this year I knew it was the time to do it. It looked honestly impossible but I trusted that with the help of this community, EVMavericks and my friends that I would be able to achieve the feat! Staking aligns with my long-term financial goals as well as with with the future of Ethereum that I want to see and I wanted to do my part. Running minority clients too to promote the health of Ethereum.

Big thanks to Haurog for basically handholding me, thanks to everyone here and EVMavericks discord for answering my many newbie questions, shoutout to Ethstaker for helping me out too, also to a few of my friends from the Dopest private chats and to so many other people who were willing to lend a hand but I already had enough support. I took my time to understand, learn, experiment and to feel relatively comfortable. I'm sure it's not fully done yet as I might be sweating when I pass the entry queue but so far everything has been looking good. There's still a few things to set up bandwith wise for me and in terms of how to monitor (so far I have grafana and just look at beaconchain site).

Not sure what else to add but if I remember something I'll add later. if you also have questions, lmk!

Can't wait for my money printer to go brrrr and print me blocks w 69E rewards!!!

<summary>u/PhiMarHal outlines a big opportunity for web 3</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16aesof/daily_general_discussion_september_5_2023/jz7itxv/)

Google lets scammers buy adspace and makes no effort to moderate this.

Twitter is letting spambots run free as long as they pay $8 for a blue checkmark or $1000 for a gold one.

Discord is adding a feature to let you hide links so they redirect to a different place.

There is a fundamental incentive problem with the law ruling big service providers should have no accountability whatsoever for the content they host. Let criminals use your platform AND get paid for it? Why shouldn't they take that deal.

This is especially inane when said platforms do take moderation actions for various ideological or political motives. You're either a neutral service provider, or you have administrative rights and exercise editorial content. Can't have both. In the latter case, you should be help responsible for your content, and sorry but not sorry if this doesn't play well with big-tech business model of harvesting value generated by user content while running only minimum human intervention.

There is an obvious answer here. If these platforms were run as credibly neutral infrastructure, as part of distributed ledgers nobody can unilaterally censor... Those laws regarding lack of accountability would make sense.

The mainstream Internet as it exists today makes no sense as web2 whereas it would be sensible as web3.

[u/ThatGuyThatGuyThagay](https://reddit.com/u/ThatGuyThatGuyThagay):

I see the solution to Lido problem as follows:

1) Reduce the advantage of pooling by burning MEV - all validators, get equal beacon chain rewards. Solo validators have advantage over pool, because of LST fee.

2) Protocol level smoothing of block proposals or similar, same way in PoW, people use pools not because it gets the bigger rewards, but because they get them more consistent.  

3) Make solo staking more accessible. (how comes there is still no double-click executable on windows that get you staking in no time? Even shitcoins have them).

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

> Protocol level smoothing of block proposals or similar, same way in PoW, people use pools not because it gets the bigger rewards, but because they get them more consistent.

Block proposals themselves really don't earn a lot of consensus income - only about two weeks worth of attestations.

Once the impact of MEV is removed from proposal income (due to MEV smoothing pools and/or MEV burn), I don't think block proposals will need smoothing. That's a good thing!

> Make solo staking more accessible. (how comes there is still no double-click executable on windows that get you staking in no time? Even shitcoins have them).

I agree on this. Back in the early days of Bitcoin, I used to keep my Bitcoin client running in the background to help provide bandwidth to the network (and keep my wallet in sync!). You would just double-click the Windows executable and then forget it in the system tray. GPU mining was like that, too.

It should be just as easy to stake on Ethereum. The process should go like this:

1. Double click installer exe. Install.

2. Run. Wizard prompts you to choose consensus and execution clients, with a short blurb about each one and a note about client diversity.

3. You get kicked out into the main UI. Your clients are now syncing. There's a little progress bar that shows how long till they're synced enough to be staking-ready.

4. When sync is done, you click the little "plus" button at the corner of the main UI, to add new validators.

5. (For first time adding validators only) - Wizard generates staking seed phrase, prompts you to write it down, forces you to retype it.

6. Wizard prompts you to enter the amount of validators you wish to add, previews how much ETH you need.

7. Wizard prompts you for the withdrawal address you want to use for these validators.

8. Wizard generates deposit data json file, prompts you to upload it and deposit ETH using the Staking Launchpad.

9. Wizard reads the blockchain directly and recognizes your Staking Launchpad deposits. Kicks you back out into the main UI where you can see the pending status of your validators, along with an estimate of when they will be through the queue.

10. Once they're through the entry queue, the app basically acts like a native version of beaconcha.in, showing your attestations and effectiveness, proposals, income graph, stuff like that.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency explains a cool little defensive measure in the Ethereum protocol which protects against 51% attacks</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16bb42v/daily_general_discussion_september_6_2023/jzfl07v/)

Hey it just occurred to me - a 51% attack is not actually profitable to Lido in terms of ETH, at least in the short term. I forgot about this little quirk (smart design decision) in the [Ethereum protocol](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/inactivity/):

> The reason why no validators receive attestation rewards during an inactivity leak is once again due to the possibility of discouragement attacks. An attacker might deliberately drive the beacon chain into an inactivity leak, perhaps by a combination of censorship and denial of service attack on other validators. This would cause the non-participants to suffer the leak, while the attacker continues to attest normally. We need to increase the cost to the attacker in this scenario, which we do by not rewarding attestations at all during an inactivity leak.

So by 51% attacking Ethereum, LST pool providers would be hurting the LST's own holders (and their reputation for making profit) by forgoing staking rewards for the duration of the attack. People would obviously rush to try to pull their money out, or at least they should.

An attacker could avoid this mechanism by attacking with 66% of the stake. 66% is the point at which an attacker can attack the chain without forgoing short-term staking rewards.

I just wanted to share this, because it's a factor I had forgotten about, and it throws a curveball at any 51-66% attacker.

<summary>u/haurog doesn't accept the Lido narrative and u/nixorokish reiterates the kind of threat Lido poses</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/160phdq/daily_general_discussion_august_25_2023/jxo14ll/)

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

I find it the most interesting that the Lido narrative: ¬¥there will only be one LST and because of that it is better it is us (Lido) than any even more centralized player¬¥ is so readily accepted by many people. This narrative enables Lido to aggressively grow through dubious means like the [karpatkey partnership](https://twitter.com/AnotherVizsla/status/1665694309046185987). Karpatkey manages many large DAO treasuries and apparently karpatkey bought steth with these treasuries and blocked adding other LSTs. Only after public outcry some DAOs intervened and now hold a more diverse LST portfolio.

In my opinion, accepting this narrative makes people complacent and fall in line behind Lido, because the alternative, e.g. binance dominating the staking market, is obviously a worse outcome. Lido propagates this statement because it helps them to justify their means. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy which again helps Lido. It is not surprising that Lido now aggressively spreads this narrative again on various platforms like bell curve podcast, bankless and twitter. Lido is well connected and they can place their narrative quite effectively in the space.

Does the narrative actually make sense? At the core the narrative is ¬¥The dominant LST has the most integrations and the largest network effect¬¥ and due to this all ETH will flow to it. In essence it reduces the complexity of staking products to one or two quantities and argues the end state lies at the edge, i.e. one dominating LST. This pushes people into becoming [convex thinkers](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html), which in this case helps Lido to divide up the market 'You either support us or you support big centralized exchanges'. The simplicity of the narrative to me is similar to some very simplified arguments by (hobby) economists which are then surprised that actual market data contradicts them. They then argue that people are not 'rational' actors. But what actually happens is they dumbed down the complexity of a system to a level which makes it easily calculable but the outcome of this simplified system does not match reality anymore because they unknowingly removed some essential mechanics.

Even the market itself does not support the Lido narrative If you look at market data, like the recent [glassnode insights report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2023/). Lido grew by 54% since January 2023, and rocket pools rETH grew by 157%. How is this even possible because I thought according to their narrative they would win automatically because of network effects. rETH is by pretty much all quantifiable means an inferior product: Lower network effect, lower liquidity, fewer integrations, lower yield. People now even pay a premium to own rETH. Is it because people are stupid? I would argue that the simple convex thinking of the Lido narrative removed a lot of the actual complex decision making of market participants and that is why the Lido narrative should at least be questioned or even rejected outright.

But why does Lido dominate. They were the first LST. Making staking accessible for everyone. They are less centralized than Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. They did not really have any competition in the market until about 1 year after the Beacon chain launch when Rocket Pool started. And now there are alternatives, some better, some worse and new entrants will come. Sure, due to historical reasons Lido will be the larges LST for years to come, but I am personally not convinced that they will inevitably reach 90% market share because of network effects alone.

And now to a more personal note. Does it make a difference for me to buy an LST from an established player compared to a new entrant? Yes definitely. Storing my ETH in a tested smart contract has its value. Having access to degen plays is great. Being able to borrow money against my LSTs is necessary. But does it make a difference if the established player has over 30% dominance or 3%. Not really. rETH has enough liquidity and integrations for me with just about having 4% of the staking market share. The marginal utility of network effects of a larger LST protocol is already pretty close to zero and other parameters, like systemic risks, become more important.

TL;DR: The Lido narrative of 'There will only be one LST' has been spread quite efficiently by Lido. This simple narrative leaves out nuance and makes the community complacent. Even the market itself does not seem to support the narrative. Be careful accepting or spreading it further.

[u/nixorokish](https://reddit.com/u/nixorokish):

to reiterate something that seems confusing to casual users:

Lido's threat is not a threat *on top of* Ethereum. It's not about centralizing the economy running on top of it, it's not about a widespread smart contract risk (though it does add that, too).

This is what the strategy leader at Lido (Hasu) laid out on his [recent Bankless episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfuUdIblfrY):    

> 1. Solo staking will trend down to <1% of the network
> 2. Liquid staking is the superior form of staking and all staking will migrate there
> 3. LSTs will converge to a single LST

The result of this is that 99% of Ethereum's validators are controlled by Lido. That means that Ethereum is governed by the Lido DAO. The Lido DAO can choose to censor, blacklist, or finalize whatever they want on the chain. They become vulnerable to government pressure or human corruptibility to do these things. They can pressure their very small operator set to do these things in the shadows (especially once forced exits are implemented). 

This fundamentally changes what Ethereum is. It becomes the Lido DAO chain. Might as well use BNB chain at that point. Ethereum's validator set is absolutely core to its decentralization, permissionlessness, and credible neutrality.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/162h6a2/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2023/jxzli1d/)

This was a response lower but I think it merits a full text. Lido situation often gets compared to the bleak bitcoin mining pool situation where 3 pools account for >75% of all hashpower. 

I think the lido situation is actually *worse* than bitcoin mining pools.

Switching hashpower between pools is easy, switching stake from one LST to another requires the entry and exit queues which are multiple months long and thus entrench one lst. Eg. If lido went corrupt and starting doing reorgs to steal MEV then the rate at which they lose stake is limited by Ethereum consensus. Further, there‚Äôs actual economic irrationality to switch away since lido earns more in this paradigm (assuming no user activated slash).

The point being is that there are no economics that inhibit mining pools and this has been proved through voluntary self limitations.

Ethereum is struggling with this.

**Act 1: Uncertainty Unveiled**

*(Scene: A bustling virtual realm resembling Ethereum's landscape. Characters Lido, Operator A, Operator B, and DSA Representative are present.)*

Lido: (Addressing the audience) The enigma of the future looms over Ethereum like a shadow. The path ahead is hazy, as we navigate uncharted waters.

Operator A: (Whispering to Operator B) Have you heard the rumors about DSA's interference?

Operator B: (Nodding) Yes, word is they want to certify operators with their software. It's like handing control to a new sheriff.

*(Enter DSA Representative)*

DSA Representative: (Authoritatively) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the new era of certified staking. The Divided State of America demands compliance with our guidelines. Only those who bear the badge of "certified operator" shall stake and govern the network.

**Act 2: Compliance and Consequences**

*(Scene: Lido's assembly hall. Lido and a group of Operators are in discussion.)*

Lido: (Addressing the Operators) We stand at a crossroads. DSA's decree is clear, and we must decide how to respond.

Operator A: (Raising a hand) What about those of us who don't wish to comply with DSA's terms?

Lido: (Serious) Dissent is a luxury we can't afford. Compliance is the path we've chosen, for now.

Operator B: (Angrily) So, we relinquish our autonomy to become mere pawns?

Lido: (Solemnly) Our choice is stark, yet we must weigh the consequences.

*(Operators mumble among themselves.)*

**Act 3: The Shadows of Cartelization(Scene: Ethereum's digital realm, depicting bustling stakers and traders.)**

Operator A: (Defiantly) I can't ignore my principles. I'm unstaking.

Operator B: (Worried) But the queue to restake is overwhelming, not to mention the enticing profits we'd be leaving behind.

Lido: (Observing with a sinister grin) As DSA's grip tightens, chaos unfolds.(Operators reluctantly withdraw, some out of principle, others due to sheer inconvenience.)

Narrator: (Voiceover) The Ethereum ecosystem stands at a precipice, as Lido's influence swells, furthering the consolidation of power.

*(Lido's dominance continues to grow, its ominous shadow looming larger over Ethereum.)*

Operator A: (Resolute) We can't let this tyranny persist. A fork is our last resort.

Operator B: (Doubtful) But Lido's stranglehold is formidable, and with DSA's support...

*(Lido faces a pivotal decision: Embrace cartelization or confront dissent.)*

Lido: (Calculating) The road ahead is murky, but our grip on power is undeniable. Ethereum shall bend to our will.

*(Curtain falls, shrouding Ethereum's future in an unsettling darkness of cartelization and control.)*

[u/Tricky_Troll](https://reddit.com/u/Tricky_Troll):

This comment was a reply made on a comment with little attention at the end of yesterday's daily so I am sharing it now. Basically, in light of people complaining that "Gitcoin lost its way", often pointing to the use of money from Shell in one funding round and another controversy around funding for minority groups in the ecosystem, here is my counter argument.

> One could argue that Gitcoin is doing what it was designed to as a protocol. It's supposed to be modular for many different types of funding rounds with many different organisations. Funding from Shell, funding for minority demographics etc. This is all controversial due to your subjective opinion on what you want Gitcoin to be. Well the Gitcoin vision was for it to grow up and become a protocol for all, not to remain a niche technical Ethereum native app. Much like how there are many Linux distros for whatever niche you want, this is a feature and not a bug.
> 
> Just because I don't like the fact that Ubuntu exists and adds telemetry to an ecosystem which is generally much more private than other operating systems, doesn't mean I see Ubuntu or Linux as a failure. Of course not, Ubuntu invites newbies into the ecosystem and if they want to progress from there they can. Meanwhile, there are privacy focused distros and ones which stick to core OG Linux community values. Same goes for Gitcoin.

I'd like to touch on Gitcoin and their passport with which they are trying to become decentralised proof of human/anti-sybil standard while constantly changing stamps to accomodate whatever new KYC-grab your ETH shady project they partner with like Proof of humanity, Civic etc.

Other stamps are connect your social networks, like sybils have problems with that.

One of the stamps is GTC staking, stake our coin to prove you are human?

SHOUT OUT TO  EV Maverick  /u/lanternfinance because his team is building something  I think many would and should be interested in if solo staking scares the shit out of you. 

If you live in any of these states, would you be open to chatting with a team called Lantern Finance? Staking as a Service. Pure play staking service provider.  

They are launching October and looking for early people in these states to talk to about participating in a feedback session. 

Right now, though, they want to talk to some folks about their journey and history and get feedback on their current experiences/struggles with staking.

They are doing SAAS using KYC through Persona, custody through BitGo for custody with insurance, and are building a simple and effective U.S. based service complete with tech support/phone support etc.  They have onboarded a team of around 8 iirc.

Super easy to talk to and I hope some of you can line up a  quick meeting. Highly recommend even if you aren't from these states.  I'm planning on joining the early feedback cohort in October and I hope some of you can too.  (this meeting isn't about investing! Just about experience with staking in general they want to know what features to focus on)

Here are the claims made about Ethereum between those time stamps, and my rating for each one.

**JP Morgan owns a lot of crucial Ethereum infrastructure - MOSTLY FALSE**

While JP Morgan does have some financial ties to Ethereum infrastructure, they don't "own a lot". JP Morgan [owns less than 10% of Consensys](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4783940855323-Is-MetaMask-owned-by-JP-Morgan-) (Consensys is the parent company for Metamask, Infura, Besu and Teku). Of course while Metamask and Infura are both influential and widely used, they are not the only games in town and they are not "crucial" to Ethereum's survival. And while 10% may be enough to demand a board seat and sway some close votes, it's a far cry from "owning infrastructure" in the sense that it's under their thumb.

**JP Morgan dollarized the Ethereum network - FALSE**

Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) did the most to dollarize Ethereum, imo. Circle is owned in part by the venture capital arms of several big banks, but I could not find JP Morgan Chase listed as one of them in any VC announcement. Tether is [privately owned by 4 rich dudes](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/02/86-of-tether-was-controlled-by-4-people-wsj/).

**Stablecoins represent more value on the Ethereum blockchain than ETH itself - FALSE**

By roughly adding up the top dozen stablecoins on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins), Ethereum's stablecoin market cap is less than $150B. Compare this to ETH's market cap of $204B.

**JP Morgan and Citigroup basically own the NY Fed - MOSTLY FALSE**

[There is no ownership in a corporate sense.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm) While banks are required to "own" shares of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve answers to their Board which is directly accountable to Congress, and profits are never distributed to shareholders. It's a strange corporate structure, but that's government agencies for you. Many consider Congress to be bought and paid for by private interests though in the end, so that's why this only earns a rating of "mostly" false.

**Elon Musk bad - TRUE**

<summary>u/SikhSoldiers compares the pros and cons of on-chain vs off-chain swaps</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15uartw/daily_general_discussion_august_18_2023/jwsdij5/)

Cowswap is awesome. You generally get the best price for execution and you have gas abstracted away. It‚Äôs so good that uniswap is more or less copying them for univ4 

However, the Coincidence of Wants that CoW is famed for is an off chain matching system. If we have the largest dex in the space move liquidity / market making off chain, we will be making a huge shift towards a lunarpunk ethos in perhaps a negative way. 

Onchain liquidity numbers have been super transparent and is the basis for most risk analysis. I‚Äôve gotten reth accepted as collateral on many different lending platforms and have read through a number of analyses. The one common point across all of these platforms has been proof of lasting liquidity. In fact, it was this consistent request across protocols for probable liquidity that formed the basis for reth having liquidity incentives to begin with - we needed to prove reth was liquid. 

Back to the issue at hand, when market makers move off chain they will no longer be sourcing from onchain LPs. There was a tweet a few days ago (if I wasn‚Äôt banned I‚Äôd find it) that showed only a small handful of people provided most of the ETH/usd liquidity on uni. If these people decided to become searchers in the cowswap or univ4 system, then they wouldn‚Äôt have public liquidity and slippage would become hard to predict. 

I am very favorable towards privacy in certain cases; public liquidation levels is dumb as fuck. However, onchain liquidity is like a global proof of reserves. The whole world benefits by being able to have reasonable ideas about slippage. 

Perhaps we can get the best of both worlds. It‚Äôs not unreasonable for these off chain market makers to have to post zk proofs of their holdings on chain somehow. It doesn‚Äôt have to be individualized since we only care about the picture globally. This system would also warn people when liquidity vanishes which is an issue otherwise.

Not to mention SUAVE makes this whole problem worse by abstracting liquidity at the block building level

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15uartw/daily_general_discussion_august_18_2023/jwptp73/)

A few days ago someone asked on /r/ethereum what's the advantage of scaling via L2 vs L1. I started drafting my response but life got in the way and couldn't give a timely answer. I will instead post it here, most of you will understand well this topic. But it might benefit someone that didn't think about the problem in these terms or give you another way to explain it to newcomers.

> Here is a very simple mental model to understand the scalability trilemma, or why blockchains don't scale in a trivial/naive manner.
> 
> The scalability trilemma basically states that from the following 3 properties; decentralization, security, scalability. A blockchain can only pick two. The moment you try to attain the other, you start to give up some of the other properties.
> 
> The easiest way to see why is to understand the two trivial/naive ways to scale a system. They are called horizontal and vertical scalability. Horizontal scalability is, in essence, adding more instances of the machine to solve the problem in parallel. For instance, your CPU has multiple cores to scale it horizontally. Vertical scalability is about adding more resources to a single instance, to make it able to process more per unit of time. More memory, faster CPU, faster internet connection...
> 
> The thing is that these 2 techniques are directly at odds with the other 2 properties of the trilemma. Vertical scalability is at odds with decentralization. And horizontal scalability is at odds with security.
> 
> In essence, if you make the requirements to run a node bigger (vertical scalability) you make it harder and harder for anyone that wants to run an instance. Instead of being able to run it in a consumer grade PC, you will have to run in an AWS intance, or a mainframe. Or whatever ridiculous machine you need to validate [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs). So if you simply increase the resources needed to run a node you end up centralizing the network. This is what Avalanche, Solana, and various other alt-L1s that promised to have solved scalability did. They are just giving up decentralization for scalability.
> 
> And horizontal scalability essentially requires splitting the network in shards, each of which validates different sets of transactions, so you can validate in parallel. But if you do this in a naive manner, it's obvious that the security of the network suffers because the cost to attack each shard is proportionally smaller as there are less validators verifying the transactions.
> 
> The roll-up roadmap is a non-naive way to scale the network. It uses sophisticated cryptographic techniques to build compressed proofs of computation, that basically enable to scale the same blockspace by many orders of magnitude, as many transactions can be batched together and posted in a compressed form. It also enables parallel (sharded) execution, you can have multiple roll-ups each of which executes transactions in parallel, without sacrificing the security of the network.

[u/PhiMarHal](https://reddit.com/u/PhiMarHal):

Every good ponzi, by lasting long enough, hits a moment of capitulation. At that point, initial haters are swayed by its resilience, and join in despite their misgivings.

If the ponzi is especially good, this moment is properly enhanced by an announcement. Lever capitulation into full-blown FOMO.

I believe we hit that moment yesterday with friend.tech. The Paradigm stuff, airdrop points. My timeline is filled with otherwise reasonable people hopping on board.

"But why, Phi, why do you call friend.tech a ponzi? I'm having fun. They're going to release more features. Social tokens are the future."

My own perspective comes down to simple math.

The price curve for shares is supply squared. Goes up fast, goes down faster. You get that high initial growth, tricking your brain into extrapolation, even though in reality it's pricing people out; then once sentiment turns and people dump, you'll get a catastrophic fall, with everyone and especially late buyers scrambling to get out.

Platform fees are 5% on every trade. Open up your calculator app and type $1000. Multiply it by 0.95. Then do that same operation again and again. See how much money you have left after 3 trades, 5 trades, 10 trades; see how much value is extracted from the userbase by the developers.

You add these two together, you have a recipe for a heavily negative sum game. The money is siphoned away from the system no matter what, a minimum of 10% (in + out), and more the longer you stay in and trade.

I'm a reckless gambler myself. I'm not going to tell you you can't have fun in a ponzi, I'm not going to talk to you about morality. But I would tell you this is one of those times where don't-put-any-money-you're-unwilling-to-lose should apply strongly. It will come crashing down, and there will be many more losers than winners; the math makes this inevitable. 

Any money you put in friend.tech is a greater's fool theory bet where the odds are stacked against you.

In 2013 I was part of a local bitcorn group. We had this one member, "Tammy" [not his real name], who attended every meeting and always contributed to really insightful discussion. The thing was, Tammy never bought bitcorn or any of the altcoins that were springing up the time. He explained that if he never bought coins he could never get scammed. He prided himself on understanding the fundamentals of every coin, and he was very sharp at identifying potential weaknesses of different coins. But he never bought in. To this day, I'm still not sure he has every held crypto.

My point is that it's no fun to participate in crypto if you avoid new things. It's no fun to sit on the sidelines and point out flaws. I don't want anyone to blow their stack, and I'm very honest about what I believe are valuable tools, and what I think are fads, but it's OKAY to check out fads. Could you imagine still being unwilling to hold jpg NFTs because they're just pictures? Pretty much anyone who holds that view is still living in 2019.

So I urge EthFinance to relax a little bit, stop being so scared of things that are likely to be fads and just check them out with care and caution. I have a group of fad enthusiasts and we've explored three fads this month and all of them have been a ton of fun. 

Give yourself time to grow if you need it. Skip this one, no harm, but commit to sticking a pinky toe in the next thing just so you can enjoy the ride.

**Big brain take:** "This is both an innovative platform and an app with major hurdles and design flaws to adoption. It has unique utility like token gated chat rooms which will almost certainly be valuable in the future on some kind of future platform but it might not be this one. Friend.tech has many weaknesses and in particular it uses a highly volatile uniswap V1/2 based curve for pricing of influencer shares. As a result prices fluctuate wildly and will leave many users with a sour taste in their mouth when they get dumped on. This is a big hurdle to mainstream adoption and the price dumps are why all the normies leave and talk shit about crypto in a bear market. 95% of people don't want to speculate on this shit. Furthermore, there is also an enormous 5% fee on all trades which quickly bleeds users of their investments if they trade regularly."

Edit: I agree with a lot of your takes in the replies, my point isn't that any one of them is wrong, just that your nuanced takes are what I have been wanting more of and less one sentence posts whining about it or shilling it.

<summary>u/Fheredin is interested in a hypothetical decentralized Wikipedia and u/OkDragonfruit1929 has some great thoughts</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15wxpta/daily_general_discussion_august_21_2023/jx5ooyy/)

[u/Fheredin](https://reddit.com/u/Fheredin):

So...is anyone interested in brainstorming a decentralized alternative to Wikipedia?

If you aren't familiar, [Brian Lunduke just posted this video on Wikipedia's finances.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T23Be33G1II) 

TL;DR? Wikipedia's expenses are roughly a third of their revenues; the difference goes to "charities" which have some strange political ties. 

I wasn't born yesterday. A defacto information platform like Wikipedia donating 2/3rds of its revenue to political entities is going to end with Wikipedia itself censoring opinions to protect their donation streams, and perhaps to curry favor with politicians. 

Things get even worse when you consider Lunduke's previous financial investigation. Mozilla gets most of its revenue from--drumroll, please--Google. I swear, Big Tech has monetary incest problems which make FTX look solvent.

[u/OkDragonfruit1929](https://reddit.com/u/OkDragonfruit1929):

Any Ethereum L2 based decentralized Wikipedia alternative should focus first and foremost on censorship resistance. Financial incentives are secondary.

Censorship resistance should be the top priority to prevent the platform from censoring opinions and information based on pressures from outside entities purchasing the right to edit articles. Without proper censorship resistance, the alternative Ethereum L2 based Wikipedia alternative will quickly fall into the same issues as Wikipedia, where donations and political ties influence what information is allowed or promoted on the platform.

Wikipedia donates 2/3 of its revenues to outside organizations, many with concerning political connections. This creates a dangerous incentive for Wikipedia to censor information to protect donation revenue streams or curry political favor. The power to control information is far too valuable enough as it is without adding the possiblity of profiting if some sort of cookie-cutter financial DeFi game is uesd and applied to a wikipedia alternative on an Ethereum L2.

If the alternative platform relies on tokenizing as a way to weight one user's edits over another, the incentives could lead to censorship and conflicts of interest around what information is allowed or promoted. Financial rewards or incentives for users should be secondary to creating a platform resistant to all forms of censorship and bias. Rewards based on "truthfulness" could easily turn into subjective censorship.

Any form of censorship, no matter how well-intentioned, can be exploited to silence dissenting opinions and shape narratives. Maintaining censorship resistance should be the highest priority.

Without proper incentives and protections, all platforms, even L2 Ethereum dApps, are vulnerable to becoming tools of censorship. The alternative must be designed from the ground up to resist this.

<summary>u/benido2030 is structuring the community made EthFinance Bull Case for Ethereum.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15xvfqk/daily_general_discussion_august_22_2023/jx8xjmw/)

[As stated last Friday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15uartw/comment/jwoy85h/), this week I have started to structure all of your feedback for a potential "EthFinance Bull Case for Ethereum" post, which could also be used for a short video. 


**Ethereum the network**

- No competition for decentralized blockspace
- Only credible neutral blockchain/ network
- Ethereum is green since Proof of Stake 
- Ethereum still number 1 for developers
- Ethereum is the only blockchain/ with multiple clients
- The EVM is lindy
- Ethereum is scaling via L2s / there is enough blockspace/ ‚Äúinfra‚Äù now / cost per tx will go down with 4844
- ETH (and Layer2) is home to native stablecoins
- ETH continues to attract big companies developing payment solutions (VISA/ PayPal) and even nation states introducing CBDCs (on EVM and not ETH?)


**Ether the asset**

- ETH as a triple point asset
- ETH as Store of Value
- ETH is needed for transactions plus collateral plus money
- ETH has a risk free yield via staking (narrative) 
- deflationary asset ("supply go down, number go up") // supply shock
- Multiple nation states and corporations buying and staking ETH to ensure the decentralization of the network
- only with ETH you can build a decentralized stablecoin?
- Demand from developed countries 


Some comments: 

1. These are obviously just bullets, so I'll add detailed thoughts once we all agree on the structure and I am not sure this is the best structure yet. For example you could add a third a third category with "Narratives" which could include the "ETH is green" or "Risk free yield" bullets. Also something like "Use Cases" probably could be its own category as well. Looking forward to your thoughts and potential changes you would like to see!
2. I have tried to write about Ethereum and ETH, so in a way that's not comparing it to any other network/ asset. I really liked [these](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15uartw/comment/jwpqf93/) statements made on Friday, but have rephrased them. 
3. I have added my own points, so some bullets are "new.
4. If you feel your points are not fully covered or inadequately worded in these bullets, feel free to drop a comment and suggest a change

Next steps (from my point of view, but also happy to receive feedback when it comes to the process!) would be to collect your feedback, change the structure/ reorganize all arguments, enhance every bullet or even split them to make sure everything is covered. After that I will start drafting short paragraphs for each point, but also encourage all of you to draft a bull case yourself or at least pick your favorite point(s) and draft a small text for those.

how to move crypto through a CEX when you usually just transact onchain:

1. Do a test transaction to your newly generated CEX address (don't reuse old ones!). Check to see if balance has updated. Forget that CEXs take a while to see the transaction. Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.
2. Stare at screen for 30 seconds and then move on to something else while you wait

For those who didnt see 2 days ago EVMavericks kicked off a novel idea to create a community sourced decentralized art collection around a central theme!

To my knowledge this would be the first of its kind, right now we have close to 40 people/artists that have committed to creating art for the project. Would be awesome to hit 100 and showcase a unique robust collection in Ethereum!

Any and all funds raised from it would go towards whatever initiative the artists decide on.

One of the members just suggested a broad theme, "Decentralization", so that or something like it may be what we go with!

I personally am excited to see all the different takes/art styles/perspectives on something abstract like "decentralization", would make for a pretty compelling artistic experiment!

If youre interested in participating and contributing art join the discord (dont need an EVM)and head over the public untitled art channel and hit the thumbs up on the first message!

Just wanted to share my excitement - today's been full of firsts for me! I used the Arch User Repository for the first time to build frame-eth from source, and successfully used the Frame Wallet and managed to bridge to Base. But wait, there's more... I also minted my very first Base NFT! üé®üî•
  
I've been hearing a lot about Frame wallet, and I figured with the official launch of Base, I could use this as an opportunity to test out two new tech innovations at the same time. Finally took to the Arch User Repository and installed the latest Frame wallet from source and it's genuinely a feeling I can't quite put into words. The whole process was much smoother than I expected, and I'm really excited about the potential of decentralized tech.

For anyone still on the fence, just dive in! The waters are fine, and the learning experience is invaluable. üòä

<summary>u/Nomadic8893 critiques the current state of L2s and u/PhiMarHal replies with coming solutions</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15ppv3o/daily_general_discussion_august_13_2023/jw2x1pa/)

[u/Nomadic8893](https://reddit.com/u/Nomadic8893):

From a user experience standpoint and someone who identifies as both a "normie" but also has slightly bit above average knowledge of crypto/blockchains, imma just say it: L2s UX is a mess.

You're expecting the TikTok/plug and play/ iPhone and iPad generation to  know how to setup Metamask, to bridge over ETH to one of 10+ L2s, do DeFi/NFT with fragmented liquidity amongst the layer 2s and 8 versions of AAVE/Uniswap/Sushiswap/Blur/OpenSea, wait 8 days to bridge back to mainnet, and keep up with whats possible to do on different L2s....? Don't even have to get the point about lack of decentralization on the L2s.

It seems to me the current structure of the Ethereum blockchain enforces favorable tokenomics on the layer 1 (capped blockspace and throughput, deflationary issuance, hardening of ETH) while giving users an option to opt into a low gas fee/high throughput environment, which on the face of things, is ideal, best of both worlds. But in reality, I feel that it severely degrades the user experience, creates multiple friction points, and ultimately deters Ethereum from any sort of mass adoption, mainly catering to the crypto-crowd. Hope I'm wrong and Ethereum thrives, but this user complexity is, for me, is one of the largest issues that Ethereum has to contend with for long term expansion and adoption.

[u/PhiMarHal](https://reddit.com/u/PhiMarHal):

Personally, I expect most people to experience blockchain through account abstraction, and for the driver to be a dapp rather than a blockchain/rollup. 

i.e. you're on Base mainnet because you're playing words3.xyz, but really you don't even need to know you're on Base mainnet. You hold a Reddit NFT but you don't even know it's a NFT, or where it exists.

Even in the EOA world of today, this is smoothed out on wallets like Rabby handling the network switching quite smoothly.

As for those dapps existing on different places, I think that existence is pretty fungible. It doesn't matter to me if Uniswap liquidity is fragmented when I can technically get the same execution price within 0.1% of general market price. More exotic assets will have to pick and choose, but then I wouldn't expect normal people to invest in esoteric tokens.

To me, getting to subcent fees while maintaining essential decentralization, security and credible neutrality properties is more important. Perceived user complexity is mostly a consequence of the space exploring many venues to this day.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15qkvqf/daily_general_discussion_august_14_2023/jw5sa0a/)

Hope everyone is hanging in there and keeping your heads up. Bearish/crabish times can sometimes feel like an extended hunger pit in your stomach.  This too shall pass and brighter days will come, rest assured. 

I started up my weekly buys again back when we last touched the 1700s and will continue to do so for better or worse, until we are out of the crab range above 2k with solid seeming resistance.

Fam and friends who hold ETH will periodically check in, fishing for price predictions from me.. I tell them the same thing over and over, that I don't expect any meaningful positive price action (anywhere near ATH) to happen until US inflation is tamed, fed fund rates are cut down to a more normal rate, and not during any sort of recession because of rate cuts. We need to be out of those woods before I feel the sentiment will change with risk assets.  

Tall order but that order will be filled. And as some have speculated here, the soonest I think that's going to happen would be sometime in 2025. Obviously just a best guess and honestly, an optimistic guess in my point of view. Time passing without catastrophic events happening in crypto would be a blessing. We need time to heal the wounds of the great Terra/Luna collapse and all the subsequent fallout that was left in the aftermath. We're already starting to see some closure type things happening.. Mashinsky arrest, SBF back to jail, some blockfi funds are being returned, etc.. while we still have far to go, Gemini still in the lurch with Earn, SEC drama and so forth. Time will sort all of these things out and I believe for the better. 

Meanwhile, growth is ongoing in our space, another time dependent variable.  Mistakes will be learned from, innovation is inevitable all in good time. 

Personally, somewhat recently, I've been working on some lifestyle changes.. which started with getting a check up at the doctors. Blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, exercise.. all very important to keep up on.  I even grabbed an oura ring to help monitor sleeping habits. I feel as though I'm training mentally and physically for the next bull run lol. But in all seriousness, it feels great to trend in a healthy direction. I work for myself, so keeping motivated and energy levels up are a persistent goal. I've also been traveling with more frequency and doing my best to travel with friends. The times I get to vacation a bit with friends, I realize they need it just as much as I do. Anyways.. 

Lastly, I might not chime in here much but I certainly read the daily everyday and have since long before the migration to r/ethfiance . I very much appreciate this community and the effort of those who do take the time to post in here. Thank you all!

Hello r/ethfinance!

As summer draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on the incredible journey I've taken this season. I'm thrilled to share that I have successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Decentralized Finance and Central Bank Communication", with a primary focus on the market microstructure of DEXes. This achievement was by no means a solo endeavor, and I owe a significant debt of gratitude to this community.

Throughout the research process, the insights, discussions, and support from r/ethfinance have been invaluable. Many of the comments here have enriched my understanding and shaped my perspectives on the evolving landscape of decentralized finance.

I'm excited to start a new chapter as an Assistant Professor at Stockholm Business School. In this role, I will continue to dive deep into the intersection of market microstructure and DeFi, fueled by the passion and knowledge I've gained from this community.  

In essence, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude to every member who posed challenging questions, shared enlightening resources, or simply offered words of encouragement. Thank you! / Magnus

<summary>u/nixorokish noticed a shift in Ethereum "competitors" and u/LogrisTheBard shares insights into system design</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15rirbm/daily_general_discussion_august_15_2023/jwa12ac/)

[u/nixorokish](https://reddit.com/u/nixorokish):

this is an interesting shift - we've moved on from serious competitors trying to replace Ethereum's L1 and now we're looking at entities trying to become Ethereum on top of Ethereum. the provider that becomes ubiquitous and that people build on top of - Eigenlayer, Lido v2, DVT protocols creating their own spec - they're all trying to become the dominant layer that people must use

Lido v2 believes that all liquid staking will eventually happen with stETH because defi markets want to converge to a single liquid staking token, so any staking protocol will just need to use Lido to open up a pool ("module") and they can optionally issue their own token in addition to stETH. Eigenlayer wants to be the layer that protocols use to bootstrap services. SSV, Obol - they want to build a DVT protocol that every other provider conforms to (multi client architecture, but clients must use their spec).

but all of them are doing it in a way that's antithetical to the reason (imo) for Ethereum's success - its credible neutrality and the fact that no one is the overlord here. In the example with DVT - multi client architecture is good, but not if the parent structure is centralized or not credibly neutral. They're all trying to capture what wasn't captured when Ethereum's model was developed. Humans are corruptible - DAOs are not the answer that makes something decentralized - does a serious competitor to Lido develop something that looks like Lido v2 (and Stakewise V3) but actually decentralized?

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

In my consulting work I bring up these topics a lot when I encounter any type of hostage collateral in system design. If the service is chain-adjacent I usually bring up Eigen Layer. If it's an L1 I bring up running their L1 as an L2/L3 on Ethereum. I've done this for over a dozen projects. If it's an app on chain I bring up LST collateral. I have never received a sound technical argument against this suggestion. Their argument is predictably about retaining token utility because they own a bag and want it to be worth more. When I bring up vampire attacks, the usual and sole response is that a social moat will protect them. This feels like wishful thinking to me. These approaches are going to devour the crypto space in the next decade. When we see the first vampire attack of something like Chainlink succeed where an attacker just forks their code and changes the collateral it will send off a tidal wave of copycats just like YFI did to liquidity farming with Sushi, Curve, Harvest, Aave, Kyber Rainmaker, etc. Eventually, layers of interest bearing collateral with different risk tradeoffs will be the only hostage collateral and every chain but the top few that can pay for their own security will settle on those few top chains.

I think the LST space is actually fragmenting and isn't likely to consolidate. It will look like the stablecoin space where there are dozens/hundreds of LSTs. Ideally Lido will be subject to repeated and sustained vampire attacks and will just service as a gateway into staking. I do think there will be actually decentralized LSTs but I think it's too late in the game for them to dominate. That ship has sailed, Rocketpool was our best chance and they blew the opportunity by not using the oDAO RPL rewards for liquidity farming to bootstrap themselves to massive adoption.

<summary>u/OkDragonfruit1929 is shocked by a recent big step towards mainstream adoption</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15sg07d/daily_general_discussion_august_16_2023/jwgvdjv/)

So... I just minted a "Stand with crypto" NFT with my VISA debit card and I finally understand why VISA letting you pay gas fees with your VISA card is such a big deal! 

No need for anyone to create an exchange account and buy ETH, it just works in the background! 

I am absolutely stoked about the convenience of using a VISA debit card to directly mint an NFT without the need for creating an exchange account and purchasing ETH (Ethereum) separately. This approach makes the process more user-friendly and accessible to individuals who might not be familiar with cryptocurrency exchanges or the technical aspects of buying and using Ethereum.

Using a debit or credit card to directly mint NFTs simplifies the process by abstracting away the steps involved in acquiring cryptocurrency like Ethereum and then using it to pay for minting fees or NFT creation.

It's a step towards mainstream adoption by reducing the barrier to entry and allowing more people to participate in the NFT space.

it really guts me to come here and find myself [getting shit on](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15sg07d/daily_general_discussion_august_16_2023/jwexl5d/). You don't have to know me, you don't have to trust me, but I'm proud to say that every action I've ever taken has been in the best interest of promoting greater security and decentralization of the beacon chain. I have never acted in any way contrary to these values and it's offensive that the same people keep dragging my name. YES, I accepted the role of oDAO member for Rocket Pool, a role that I am STILL very proud of, and YES, I got a lot of money for it, just like the other 18 odao members who participated in the protocol the way it was designed. YES, I voted to reduce that and have encourage further development of RP in a way that doesn't require an oDAO at all. You know what else I did? I proudly promoted a platform that has onboarded over 3000 nodes to the Ethereum network. And I'll do it again if I can. I'm not going to get shit on like a little bitch by people who haven't done shit to bring success to our network. I would STILL accept fair money for my time to support and promote other projects that are highly aligned with our goals, and I'll never mince words about projects who risk our future. Sorry.

I held my tongue back in that thread, but I found that sentiment bizarre too. If ETH development were basically dead like Bitcoin I could maybe understand the logic of the market capping out soon, but ETH is still a rapidly developing and improving technology, and still has a lot of not only adoption but simple low-hanging improvements in market efficiency in front of it. Even if core Ethereum development completely halted today, ETH would still have at least another market cycle worth of juice in it.

There still aren't any ETFs in the US. Big brokerages only just launched crypto custody less than a couple months ago. Roll-ups and zk tech still aren't mature yet. The general public still thinks NFTs are an environmental nightmare. It's been less than a year since the last PoW block was mined on Ethereum, and barely three months since its literal consensus system was completed! The queue isn't even clear yet, for god's sake!

These are probably a lot of the same people who called for $10k last cycle. Now that we've been crabbing for a while, they get all depressed and doom-and-gloom. When the bull market picks up again, they're probably going to start calling for $20k+. Then we'll top out at like $16k and they'll watch their generational paper gains slip through their fingers again.

<summary>u/bleeddonor covers the relevant Mullvad VPN situation for stakers who use a VPN</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15bntnh/daily_general_discussion_july_28_2023/jtrwycy/)

It appears that some of you aren't aware of what happened with Mullvad.

Mullvad is a VPN outfit located in Sweden, which has strong privacy laws.

Mullvad gets raided by the police who want user data:

<https://www.hackread.com/mullvad-vpn-office-raided-police-user-data/>

Mullvad frustrates that effort by not having any user data.

A little over a month later Mullvad is forced to withdraw their forwarded-ports service, which I'm sure some of you know is what you want to have if you're trying to run a node over a VPN:

<https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports/>

Not privy to the exact details of course, but it isn't rocket science to anyone who has been online for any length of time and relates to controversial political content, you poison the well.  Suddenly somebody starts using a forwarded port for child porn, the complaint is made, and now the police come back to Mullvad asking for proof they weren't they weren't the ones who produced it.  Or something like that.

Result?  Anyone here who was using Mullvad as their VPN for staking now has to a) find another VPN and b) wonder how long it will be before the same proposition is made to that vendor.

<summary>u/pr0nh0li0 points out the wrong ETH supply values on major websites</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15bntnh/daily_general_discussion_july_28_2023/jttigi4/)

None of Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, Coinmetrics, or Bitinfocharts have the right supply listed for ETH. They seem to be either accounting for new issuance but not burns, and/or they may be double counting ETH that has been withdrawn (as technically the ETH doesn't ever actually leave the staking deposit contract, but is instead re-minted at a 1-1 rate when ‚Äúwithdrawn‚Äù). It's almost been a year since the merge and almost 4 months since withdrawals were enabled. How have they not addressed this? Each of these sites has supply listed somewhere between ~120,700,000 and ~120,800,000. 

CryptoQuant seemingly has the opposite problem--accounts for burns but not new issuance under PoS (supply is under 119MM according to them).

Etherscan and Ultrasound.Money seem to get it the most correct (although it could also be noted that Etherscan has a slightly lower total supply than Ultrasound.Money). 

Would be nice if we could get some consistency here. To be fair, the set up for the withdrawal contract and BeaconChain make it a bit of a mess of accounting, but I feel like there should be some more urgency to address this issue at the big metrics sites.

Some unelected fuckface sitting in a federal agency with no legislative backing from Congress is able to threaten private service providers to cut out a legitimate American industry, using the full weight of the American government to back his threats. Raw, unelected power. 

Just as with the FDIC shutting down some banks because they are associated with crypto services, and deciding to save others which are not. Just as with Operation Chokehold 1.0 and 2.0. Unelected, authoritarian power from the Administrative State, trampling on American rights.

Watching the Supreme Court castrate these federal agencies ruling by ruling is one of the few bright spots in politics rn.

Always read the actual thing, not the twitter crypto influencer's summary of the thing.

<https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-crypto-072723>

We've had some really shady cases like the Tether attestations where they've engaged auditing companies to do "attestations" that are deliberately designed to make people think their money is safe, while leaving loopholes so they don't have to actually keep the money safe. With Tether they literally wired the money from Bitfinex into a bank account, had the auditor certify that it was all there, then wired it right back out. Tether made a bunch of statements to make people think they'd been audited, and we only found out about it because the New York regulator figured out what was happening and got the information into a public filing. This is the SEC saying, if you do an attestation that isn't an audit, you have to be honest about what it proves, and if the client starts lying about what it proves then you have to speak up about it or you could have legal liability too.

I know it's complicated to have to fight on two fronts because we need to defend ourselves against the regulators as well as the scammers but can we please stop reflexively taking the side of the scammers who keep trying to scam people all the time?

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15dcqqy/daily_general_discussion_july_30_2023/ju2b6wh/)

<https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15da5v5/us_house_committee_passes_keep_your_coins_act_to/>

This is why I check r/cc from time to time, that and sometimes the "story" posts interest me. Their knowledge of crypto is very superficial but they are often on-track with general news.

So apparently "protect self-custody" passed in a committee (every republican voted in favor and every democrat against). I am not from the US so didn't understand how the process works and I see few do on reddit, but it is basically like this. After a committee approval, it then needs to be passed in Congress, by a majority. Then in the Senate by 60% and then Biden needs to actually sign it. He can veto and it would then take a 2/3 vote to overturn, vetoes are rare (Biden has 6).

The regulation side probably interests me more than most here. So far, Ethereum is mostly only used for Defi today, not gaming, betting, insurance, tokenization of real world assets etc. NFTs is maybe the second use case but doesn't interest me. If defi were banned or I thought it would be, I wouldn't hold ETH anymore since I thought other assets would appreciate more. For example, I never bought any Monero, it's a regulatory nightmare imo. The US market is the most important because it has the most capital, being a large country and **a lot** of foreign investments. We buy stock in your companies (mostly tech), I doubt you invest much in foreign companies. 

Very often, the western world also try to follow, or even copy US regulation. I used to be interested in flying drones and in 2021 my country (Sweden), introduced new laws that were an exact copy of the US rules. You have the nice round number 400 feet as height limit, we have 120 meters, which is the equivalent in feet and we adopted the rest too. If you sanction Iran, our companies have to comply, if you close your country due to Corona, we do the same (which I think was the correct decision). There are so many things we would never do first, but if you do it, we do it too. You lose a little bit of faith in your politicians when you become aware of this. We have clear and decent crypto rules, but they could change quickly from outside pressure. We are still a progressive country with few "backwards thinkers", so that compensates a bit though.

I don't think the US will ban defi, I think it is more likely than in 2020, but I think more red tape is coming and some of it can be impossible to live up to for Americans. Like KYC on all defi protocols, making private wallets (sometimes called unhosted/dark wallets) illegal, whitelist/blacklist of dapps. I am not seeing good regulation be passed in the US that will prevent the next FTX, the next stable coin crash, clarify uncertainties or allow companies to use defi. Imo, the Ds are against good regulation that is passed by Rs and in favor of bad regulation that will hurt defi. "You want to vote on a bill to make stablecoins less of a blackbox? Fuck no, every D go out of the room so we don't have quorum and can't vote on it" - it's a clown show. A couple of days ago the Senate (D majority) passed a really bad bill that would make controllers or large investors of protocols responsible for what happens on them and require bank-like AML. If North Korean hackers used Uniswap, there are no controllers but they could go after Uniswap labs, if it passes. The Rocketpool oDAO be responsible over their products. Maybe a dapp gets hacked, they could probably go after the devs working on it and punish them. 

Hopefully this might lead to something good and make Defi more anonymous and less centralized than today. As Voorhees said, if there are controllers, it's not defi. But yea, if Blackrock enters, even with a defi ban in practice, maybe none of this "matters", price wise.

<summary>u/doctor_schmee breaks down Hex and it's recent charges from regulators</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15fzcv4/daily_general_discussion_august_2_2023/juhmuid/)

Bloomberg Opinion article on whether index funds should be illegal discussed Richard Heart and his alleged fraud if anyone is interested in reading below: 

**Hex**

Here is an economic system, or a system anyway:

1. I make up a crypto token called MattCoin. I can issue an unlimited amount of MattCoins, since I made them up.
2. I sell them to people for money.
3. You can use MattCoins to make term deposits, with me: You can give me back your MattCoins and I will keep them for some specified time period (say, a year), and at the end of the period I will hand them back to you with interest.
4. The interest is paid in MattCoins.
5. The interest rate is high, say, 38% per year.
6. This is the only thing you can do with the MattCoins. They‚Äôre not useful for payments, they don‚Äôt run smart contracts on a blockchain, all you can do is trade them on crypto exchanges and deposit them for a 38% yield paid in kind.


So you pay me $100 for 100 MattCoins, you deposit them with me for a year, and at the end of the year I give you back 138 MattCoins.

At the end of the year, how much would you expect your 138 MattCoins to be worth? I think the main options are [1] :

1. $138. You put in $100 for 100 MattCoins, meaning that they are worth $1 each, and in a year you get back 138 MattCoins. If they are still worth $1 each, then 138 MattCoins are worth $138.
2. $100. You put in $100 for some MattCoins, absolutely no economic activity happened, and in a year you get back 138 MattCoins. This is like a stock split: You had 100 shares of a pot worth $100, now you have 138 shares of a pot worth $100, each share is worth less but the pot hasn‚Äôt changed.
3. $0. You put in $100 for some MattCoins, absolutely no economic activity happened or will ever happen, in a year you get back 138 MattCoins, but I keep the $100 and you don‚Äôt get to exchange your 138 MattCoins for real money again. There is not actually a pot with $100 in it; I just took the $100! You put in $100 and got back a pile of magic beans that are not redeemable for anything. The pile grew bigger over the year, but it remains worthless.
4. More than $138. You put in $100 for 100 MattCoins, those MattCoins offered a 38% yield, other people see that 38% yield and said ‚ÄúI want some of that,‚Äù they buy some MattCoins, the price of MattCoin rises, still other people see the rising price and say ‚Äúooh I want some of that,‚Äù the price rises further, it‚Äôs a virtuous cycle, eventually each MattCoin is worth like $10,000 and your 138 MattCoins make you a millionaire.


I think that Answer 3 is the standard answer that traditional financial analysis would give you: You bought an electronic token with no cash flows ever, so it‚Äôs worth zero. I am drawn to this traditional analysis, but it has not really worked all that well for understanding crypto.


I think that Answer 4 is the standard answer that crypto would give you. This is a completely accepted mechanism of crypto finance: You have some token, the main thing that the token does is generate more tokens, you call those additional tokens ‚Äúyield,‚Äù people are attracted to the yield, they buy the token and its price goes up. The ‚Äúyield‚Äù does not come from any economic activity in the real world; it just comes from printing more tokens. ‚ÄúPonzinomics,‚Äù people sometimes say. Loosely speaking, this is the thought process behind crypto ‚ÄúPonzicoins‚Äù like OlympusDAO and Wonderland. Loosely speaking, it is the thought process behind many algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUSD. Loosely speaking, it is the thought process that Sam Bankman-Fried once described to me on Odd Lots: ‚ÄúYou start with a company that builds a box and in practice this box, they probably dress it up to look like a life-changing, you know, world-altering protocol that's gonna replace all the big banks in 38 days or whatever. Maybe for now actually ignore what it does or pretend it does literally nothing. It's just a box.‚Äù

<summary>u/hanniabu has a call to action for the EVMavericks</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15e6kzl/daily_general_discussion_july_31_2023/ju8rptz/)

I have a call to action for EVMavericks.

Something I'd love to see and I think EVM is aptly positioned for is to fill a gap I'm constantly seeing mentioned: digestible updates on what's happening in the ecosystem.

1. Map out the various different sectors (defi, NFTs, L2s, modular chains, RWAs, social, gaming, infrastructure, staking, development, security, etc)
2. Assign 2-3 people to each sector (some may need sub-sectors)
3. Those people will focus on monitoring what's going on in that space....new projects, updates, airdrop potential, etc
4. Have a separate channel for each sector/sub-sector to drop these updates
5. Have an additional person per sector/sub-sector to organize and condense those feeds and assign pre-defined metadata to each of the updates (new project, project update, airdrop, etc)
6. Have another 2-3 people collate that info into weekly summaries

From here you can monetize it to create an revenue stream which can then be used to pay contributors, grow the treasury, and fund more projects. How to monetize?

1. Start out offering this newsletter for free, this will help gain exposure/following as you get the process down and subsequent steps
2. Move to a freemium service similar to Bankless, where you offer more basic info for free and have the rest behind a paywall. Substack can be used for this.

This platform can then be used to:

* Use as a launchpad for EVM projects
* Use to push certain initiatives (such as various decentralization/diversity efforts)
* Help raise funds for public goods
* Advertise for additional revenue

<summary>u/haurog discusses Gnosis chain's recent developments and future roadmap</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/154hewp/daily_general_discussion_july_20_2023/jspneze/)

[u/shiftly](https://reddit.com/u/shiftly) linked to a [gnosis chain talk yesterday by Frederieke Ernst](https://reddit.com/comments/153l7fp/comment/jsnazwt), a gnosis co-founder were she talked about L2s, Rollups and Sidechains. I watched it on livestream yesterday as I am generally interested in the gnosis ecosystem and their chain. Shiftly mentioned being surprised by the vision of gnosis chain as they have thought it being more like an incentiviced testnet. 

I am financially and technically invested by being a solo validator on gnosis chain. So take any positive sentiment I have with a grain of salt. The history of gnosis chain is quite an interesting one. It was born as xdai chain as one of the earlier EVM compatible alt L1 chains. The interesting thing they did was not having their own coin, but using xDAI, bridged DAI, as the base token to pay for gas. No own token meant no speculative frenzy in the last bull run. They developed rather quietly the only bigger deal they made was with POAP in 2020, that is why all our POAPs life on there now. And thanks to xDAI chain POAPs can often be minted for free as the gas costs are pretty negligible and are being paid by POAP. I still remember the pre xDAI chain POAPs which sometimes would have cost me $50 to mint.

In Summer 2021 Gnosis got interested in xDAI chain and took them over. xDAI chain rebranded to Gnosis chain. They started changing the consensus layer from a more permissioned set to a permissionless Ethereum approach. For this they started using the GNO token as a mandatory staking token. One validator costs 1 GNO, which is about $120. Much cheaper than Ethereum. There are about 130000 validators on Gnosis chain, about 6 times less than on Ethereum, but the economic security is obviously much lower due to only 1 GNO being staked per validator compared to 32 ETH for a single Ethereum validator. There are some large staking as a service providers, but nevertheless there are a substantial number of solo stakers, making the gnosis chain pretty decentralized. Unfortunately, I do not have any statistics available, as the websites I used before are defunct since a few months ago.

Now to the vision. The following description is how I understand it and is from public sources I read over the last 2 years. Generally, I think it is very hard for any alternative L1 to have a value proposition as Rollups most probably will eat their lunch sooner or later. At the same time the Gnosis founders have been in the crypto space for so long, I assume they know what they are doing and how hard it is to have a value proposition. At first, their idea was for Gnosis chain to be like an incentivized testnet, like Kusama is to Polkadot. The idea was to first test hard forks on Gnosis chain and then deploy to mainnet. Reality threw a wrench in that idea, the merge on Gnosis chain was a few months after the Ethereum merge, same with the shapella hard fork which will be in 2 weeks on Gnosis chain. 

This brings me to the talk linked by u/shiftly yesterday, which describes the new vision I have not seen described before. I definitely have seen more critical talks by Gnosis chain people aginst rollups in the last few months but did not really know why. The Gnosis team pivoted Gnosis chain to being more of Cosmos like ecosystem around Ethereum. They build a trustless bridge to and from Ethereum. And also gnosis pay will make jumping from the various chains as simple and trustless as possible.

Will it work out? I have no idea. Rollups for me have been the big disappointment of 2021 and 2022 and still are far away from the final version of being as trustless and decentralized. On the other hand Optimism and Arbitrum have become pretty reliable for everyday use and various ZK rollups are coming out left and right. Nevertheless, for me Gnosis chain is a hedge against the Rollup vision not working out as fast as necessary. Gnosis chain might be able to get some more usage in the coming years. Will Gnosis chain end up as a rollup on Ethereum? Maybe. But even then, due to the decentralized validator base, they might have a headstart for sequencer decentralization compared to othe rollups which first have to achieve that.

Tldr: Gnosis chain, formerly known as xDAI chain, pivoted in the last few months to a more Cosmos like vision for the Ethereum space consisting of EVM chains connected to each other by trustless bridges. Will it work out? Who knows.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi has some delegate updates on Arbitrum and HOP</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/155dxre/daily_general_discussion_july_21_2023/jsxszc5/)

Little Arbitrum DAO update for everyone as a delegate. I'm assuming ARB links are still shadow-banned, but want to get the picture across regardless.

There has been push over the last month or so to get some type of grants framework started with the DAO. Two of the big proposals were Plurality Labs and Questbook. 

Plurarlity Labs is looking to start a grants program over multiple phases. Initially running the program, but with an end goal of phasing themselves out once a way to run grants on-chain is solved. I voted "For" this proposal ([Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f)) and it has narrowly passed. The DAO has been slow to start and somewhat directionless, so I'm hoping this will help with that. While grants will be handed out with this project, the scope is more about the big picture process that develops over the long term.

Questbook was originally tied in with Plurality Labs, but split off into it's own request. It has a similar goal - a method to run grant programs - albeit with a more focused approach. They have a system they have implemented with other projects they are looking to bring to the ARB DAO. I have been, I guess, 'sponsoring (?)' Questbook as I have been working with them to post the Snapshot / Tally votes. Snapshop has passed ([Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65)) and the Tally Vote ([Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119)) has just started up. I've voted "For" on this, as once again I think the grant projects are good for the space and like to see different ideas take a stab at growing the Aribtrum space. Having talked to the people there it seems like a good project!

An additional note. If Questbook passes, keep an eye out if you want to get involved. There will be a two week window where knowledgably crypto-ians can apply to be a Domain Allocator. Essentially, you would take over 1 of 4 target grant domains (Gaming / Developer Tooling on NOVA / New Protocol Ideas / Education, Community Growth and Events) to help decide if projects can get grant money. It is a paid role, so something to think about if your into that. There are details in the votes.

It's been a minute since I made any HOP updates too! Not too much since I last posted, a lot of housekeeping votes (multisig refills, sybil hunter airdrops). Of note tho:

* Liquidity discussions continued with a [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x28511fdf18dcb40636326bab1557211216103cd675bcc1e64270b36195096717) on providing liquidity for the HOP token. Ultimately 'failed' to no change. It is a small-cap so a lot of debate on how much of it is simply the marketcap. Regardless, as a temperature check I did vote in favor of incentivizing HOP/ETH. I honestly don't lean one way or the other on this type of thing. I do see the value and think slippage is high, but I also see the argument against throwing money after market forces of a low-cap. I voted in favor as a signal I'm open to the discussion.
* The minimum delegate threshold to get pay-outs for contributing to the DAO was voted down to 30,000 HOP with [HIP-35](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0xab8b3b1c7e1445a2454e140281f13840519eef32b418d936773cdb9d74008a92). I voted for 30,000 out of the options (30k, 40k, 50k, no change). I'd like to see more voices join, so we are hoping lowering the threshold might attract more activity. We shall see!

<summary>u/Syentist explains a potential use case to send ETH and OP skyward</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1580pwg/daily_general_discussion_july_24_2023/jt7zsc9/)

[Worldcoin goes live](https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683372181428793344) as a member of the Superchain today. 

Im not fully sold on an eye ball scanning billionaire, but it's undeniable that Sam Altman is one of the hottest names in tech at the moment, and him using a very ethereum-centric product for a digital identity solution coupled to a financial system (literally what we have been harping about for years) is pretty...interesting. For eg they are not just simply using the OP Superchain, they are even [spending effort on shipping 4844 along with Base](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-completes-migration-op-mainnet)

It's also screamingly obvious that online presence (social media, financial txs etc) need to be tied to some form of identity to prevent bot spam, and even worse, AI powered bot spam. So if this triggers a gradual "aha" moment among the tech zeitgeist, that decentralised and interconnected identity + social media + financial systems running on Ethereum are a very elegant solution to the problems of today...it could be unbelievably bullish for ETH and OP. 

Or it could be one of those retrospectively ridiculous ideas which were born and died in the depths of bear markets. We shall see soon enough.

Edit: [big V dropped a blog post on biometric proof of person hood today!](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html). Worldcoin team is listed in the acknowledgement line so some synchrony there. Reading through it, I'm more convinced than ever that Proof of Person hood/decentralised identity will cross the Rubicon and get recognized as an important "legitimate" mainstream usecase of public ledgers (and of Ethereum, specifically).

<summary>u/benido2030 shares their latest favourite podcast episodes</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1580pwg/daily_general_discussion_july_24_2023/jt9qh1v/)

**+++ Benido's favorite podcasts episodes +++**  
Some weeks ago, someone here asked for podcast recommendations and interesting episodes. Since I enjoy podcasts I thought it might be a service to the community to highlight those I really liked (or maybe disliked? Let's see what the future brings). The first edition was okay I think, so here's the second Top3.   
[Bell Curve: Is Liquid Staking a Winner-takes-all market? feat Hasu](https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve/6051e334-1f09-11ee-aa93-ef3967b342c6)

This episode is interesting. It's part of the "LST Season" of Bell Curve and the first episode after the kickoff. As most of you are probably aware Hasu is a advisor to Lido and was not really in favor of self limiting when the discussion popped up last year (or beginning of this year? I can't remember). 

What's interesting here is that Hasu explains his arguments and assumptions about the staking/ LST market (e.g. CEXes and how they could capture a massive share withouth necessarily being ETH aligned, because it's just *one* business for them). I followed the discussion back in the days, but didn't really understand where he was coming from and understand him better now. I think we have to distinguish between his comments with regards to the market ("staking/ liquid staking is a winner takes all market) and specific LST providers/ protocols. He made a very interesting comment (apparently for the first time) where he basically says "its crucial ETH stays decentralized and the criticism towards Lido is correct". 

LSTs will be huge, listening to this one is a good time investment, even if you don't agree with Hasu in the end. 

[Uncommon Core (2.0): The Reboot feat Jon Charbonneau](https://uncommoncore.co/podcast/)

Don't worry, this one is not so much about Hasu :) It's the first episode of Uncommon Core after 1.5 years, this time featuring Jon Charbonneau instead of Zhu Su (who apparently couldn't make it). 

Jon is also front and center in this episode. He is introduced and interviewed, his CV is interesting (though his statement that he's in crypto "since just one year" is kind of funny, since he had been interested before, but now he's full time. But if full time is a req, most of us aren't into crypto...). 

Jon is an interesting guy, since he is not really part of any crypto tribe, but seems to be rather ETH focussed. Since he is rather new and neutral, his point of view is interesting. I made some comments the past couple of days about L2 (de)centralization and most of those were inspired by this episode. I think he is not idealistic and I also don't see him as a "decentralization maxi", hence some of his positions will probably clash with some of us, but I also think it's good to discuss counter arguments. Mostly because of this I highly recommend this episode (and probably also to follow Jon on Twitter). 

[Epicenter Podcast:  Ethereum - MEV, Staking Derivatives and Privacy feat Vitalik](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/505)

This guest doesn't need an introduction. I picked this episode, cause it's from EthCC, so last week, and probably VB's latest thoughts. 

It's a good interview, nothing too crazy (though there was one comment that I didn't understand, but can't recall what the topic was and hence also can't ask you to explain to me, FML), but still a very good interview. 

I also picked it, cause I made a comment in the daily some time ago asking [if there shouldn't be a protocol that allows you to borrow against your validator](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ogyzj/comment/jl4q6h4/). I even stated that "It's probably way trickier than I make it seem?"... and yes, that's the case. And the issue is not tech, it's an attack vector with regards to security. Since you could basically borrow against your validator, setup more validators (repeat) and/ or basically attack the network "for free" (you'll be slashed, but you have like 80% of the ETH value back in USD or so). Vitalik mentions this in a slightly different context, but this was a crazy moment (and I have to say I should have thought about this back when I made the comment 2 months ago). 

&#x200B;

So... this is it, these were in my opinion the best podcast episodes of the past weeks. The XRP case/ decision was also a very important topic and picked up in a lot of podcasts, but I don't think it was as good as these 3. 

I think I'll be back mid August with 3 new episodes, since then I'll be back from vacation and will listen to more podcasts on the way to work.

<summary>u/wolfparking updates us on CBDCs</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/158y8lm/daily_general_discussion_july_25_2023/jtcseex/)

Nice [compilation of info on this site](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/) looking into the world of CBDCs. Interesting to see World economic dominance and powers changing gears around trade and the implications it might have for the US dollar. The article states that it is important to note that some countries build CBDCs in order to attempt to limit the United States‚Äô ability to track cross-border flows and enforce sanctions. In the long term, the absence of US regulations and standards setting can have large geopolitical consequences, especially if China and other countries maintain their first-mover advantage in the development of CBDCs.

Russia just cemented their plans to create a digital national currency [Digital Ruble](https://decrypt.co/149831/digital-rubble-russia-cbdc-vladimir-putin-inflation). They were one of the last of the BRICS economic markets group to legislate and finalize a CBDC project; South Africa now being the last to implement plans and is still trialing different  models before committing to a project.  Under the above mentioned bill, Russians will be able to make payments and transfers from their digital wallets, which would be within the central bank's platform or that of one of its partner banks. On the other hand, the CBDC can only be used for payments or transfers, not loans or deposits, according to the central bank. Testing will begin next month. 

Brazil still hasn't released their CBDC although it should come out sometime later next year [in 2024.](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/13/brazil-central-bank-plans-to-launch-a-cbdc-in-2024/)

India's pilot program is ramping up. The India central bank aims to reach a target of one million CBDC transactions per day by the end of this year from 5000-10,000 currently. [e-Rupee Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hdfc-bank-signs-up-over-100000-customers-digital-rupee-pilots-2023-07-13/)

China's digital Yuan coin hits $249 Billion in transactions so far this year. [LINK](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-digital-yuan-transactions-seeing-strong-momentum-says-cbank-gov-yi-2023-07-19/)

Currently 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, are exploring a CBDC. In May 2020, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC. A new high of 64 countries are in an advanced phase of exploration (development, pilot, or launch).

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/158y8lm/daily_general_discussion_july_25_2023/jtdsh0d/)

from Syncswap twitter "We would like to inform you of a security incident with EraLendu/Era\_Lend a lending platform on zkSync Era.The EraLend team has detected and confirmed a cyber attack on their platform at (UTC) 2023/07/25 09:27:21. 

The attack has already been contained, and the threat actor is no longer able to continue their actions, as per the official announcement from EraLend. The EraLend team is currently collaborating with cross-chain bridge partners and zkSync to prevent any further potential asset outflows. 

Only USDC deposits on EraLend were affected by this incident.All other assets remain secure and unaffected, including SyncSwap USDC/ETH LP supplied on EraLend. However, it's recommended to withdraw your supplied LP on EraLend if any until things are sorted out to avoid further issues. There is no need to withdraw from SyncSwap protocol as it's not involved in the incident.

TL;DR - EraLend has been attacked and caused certain losses for EraLend USDC depositors. SyncSwap protocol is not involved; SyncSwap LP supplied on EraLend remains secure but you should withdraw them from EraLend.

 Please follow updates from EraLend's official Discord server and Twitter to keep up-to-date, and beware of scams! We hope everyone can stay SAFUÔøº"

<summary>u/RooftopPortaPotty explains Google's latest plans to try and monopolise the internet</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/159w1cr/daily_general_discussion_july_26_2023/jtlllwu/)

Hanni, I appreciate your asking!

To start off, I have not heard of this before you shared it. This is going to be a long rambling of my thoughts and opinions.

This idea seems to be an absolute desecration of privacy on the internet. How would this even work when using an anonymizing service such as tor?

Google does have a long history of introducing new *things* that are not actual HTTP specs, purely as a way of forcing users to switch to chrome as their web browser.

Of course there are already solutions such as captchas, javascript checks, and services such as cloudflare which attempt to detect and prevent bots from interacting with web servers. That said, Web Environment Integrity seems to completely obliterate the usual flow of the world wide web.

Having such a centralized service(however the attesting API is implemented) is a devastating breach of trust of the client(though, servers should never trust clients). Who even controls this API? Google?

It seems that this idea *could* be utilized by servers regardless of infrastructure, which in some cases(such as enterprise intranet), may provide enhanced server-side security.

I absolutely agree with [vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/) that this is nothing more than DRM forced by web servers onto clients. Much more troubling is their note of the following,

>It is also interesting to note that the first use case listed is about ensuring that interactions with ads are genuine

which leads me to believe that this has been created solely for Google's ad business(after all, they are nothing more than a giant advertiser).

With chromium's market dominance, widespread implementation of this monstrosity would most certainly lead to the demise of competing browsers. 

The github link states 'Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.' as a goal. This is completely contradictory to the goal of Web Environment Integrity, which is to gain as much information about a client as possible, and share it with servers.

Another goal is 'Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation' *honest* lmao yeah fucking right google is honest.

'Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation' they just admitted that there is no point to this service. If it is avoidable, then whats it for?

'Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.' They know damn well that it will interfere with any functionality that doesnt play by their rules.

Every one of their 'example use cases' are laughable.

'Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk' is especially ridiculous, as protecting the client is the opposite of WEI's intended purpose. How would they even detect compromised devices where the compromised device is making a seemingly normal request?

The 'how it works' section is completely devoid of substance. Consider the following:

1. The website of a dapp uses googleapis, gstatic, etc for their operations.
2. Google retains an innumerable amount of data points regarding a user and their browser.
3. Google blacklists a 'browser'(still not sure how that would work, and neither do the authors of this trash idea, as is apparent) for interacting with anything crypto related.

Ok I honestly cant take this any longer. Whoever whipped this up clearly knows enough to know that this idea is evil.

I only see 4 goals of this project:

1. Make google ads inescapable.
2. Gain as much information of users of competing browsers as possible
3. Blacklist those users, and force them to use chrome
4. Ensure that google is the final arbiter of internet-worthiness

Wish I could say its surprising...

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14tuakx/daily_general_discussion_july_8_2023/jr6rp8l/)

Here's an expanded and fixed version that should help clarify.

1. One validator is randomly assigned to propose during a particular 12-second slot.
2. This validator proposes a block, either generated by them or a relay. (If they don't propose a block, no one else gets to. The slot is "missed" with no block in it. Because there is only one validator assigned to each slot, there can never be 2 competing blocks. If a single validator proposes more than one block during their assigned slot, they are slashed.)
3. All nodes, both staking and non-staking, verify for themselves that the block is valid. After verification, they pass the block on to yet more nodes, and so on through the gossip network until every node on the network has a copy of the block.
4. Other validators attest the block is valid. These votes are counted/aggregated by yet other validators. The block reaches 2/3 votes, and is finalized. These messages echo back through the network, updating staking and non-staking nodes alike as to what the most recent finalized block is.

With this in mind, please rephrase any additional questions you have, and I can do the best to help answer them!

<summary>u/Set1Less covers a couple of the newer web 3 wallets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14tuakx/daily_general_discussion_july_8_2023/jr60e02/)

Re-installed Frame wallet to give it a spin, vs my main wallet now Rabby extension. Using both via a Ledger HW Wallet. Embarked on this mainly since another user had mentioned that Rabby was tracking wallet installs, so I wanted to explore another wallet that didnt track users, but still offered the same functions. 

As compared with an earlier install, now Frame seems to connect well with most apps. However it still lacks a lot of features . 

Rabby is still way more functional for someone like me who makes many txn every day, on multiple chains/L2s. From wallet security perspective, it has inbuilt transaction simulation results which show the changes to your wallet. (example for a dex swap txn it would show 0.1 eth out, 185 usdc in etc...) So you can visualize exactly what your transaction is doing before approving it. Rabby also has many other security features like warnings when interacting with a new contract for the first time, approval limit warnings, inbuilt approval revoke interface etc. Compared to this, Frame seems rather bare bones

On the downside Rabby is clearly tracking users via an identifier number given to each install of the extension, without any opt out. As reported by u/RooftopPortaPotty

The hunt for the best wallet continues. If Frame can add these security features, it would beat Rabby hands down for me

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard educates us on the tragedy of the commons</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14uphdc/daily_general_discussion_july_9_2023/jr8s6ig/)

Today I'd like to talk about another tool from [Moloch's Toolbox](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14sx3ji/daily_general_discussion_july_7_2023/jr21wrm/). This one is like the inverse of first-mover disadvantage and it's probably the best known pattern of coordination failure. Of course I'm talking about [Tragedy of the Commons](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues). Formally, there is a known Pareto Optimum but each actor is free to defect from that strategy and personally profit by doing so at the expense of all other actors. Common outcomes from this coordination failure are things like nature ecosystem collapses from activities like overfishing, market collapses from raced selling into a price inelastic market, and famine.

By this definition, there are many examples of things that are not commonly considered "Commons" that nevertheless fall into this category of problem such as the famous Prisoner's Dilemma. The "commons" in this case is reduced jail time. In this scenario each actor is free to defect from the optimal solution and snitch to the police and reduce their personal prison time while increasing the total prison time. The net result is all actors inevitably defect and the system collapses to the worst possible value (what is the antonym of Pareto optimum called?).

To correct the incentives you have to change the local calculus of each actor. Recognizing that each actor is likely to locally optimize, you have to add external incentives for complying or external penalties for defecting from the Pareto Optimum. Typical solutions to this problem resemble [fail-deadly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-deadly) deterrence systems which admittedly isn't a source of optimism for humanity. A less seemingly insane variation of this requires that all actors submit to an common arbiter such as a government that makes defecting illegal but this solution breaks down when they don't share a nationality.

Let's look at fixing the prisoner's dilemma as an example. If, prior to the crime, each criminal had to put up a hostage then their local optimum is to risk the longer prison sentence to protect their hostage. They would be willing to do this because they also know this is true of the criminal in the other room so they can rest assured that the other criminal will also comply rather than defect. After they get out of prison with their minimum sentences they can have their hostage back so it ultimately cost them nothing to enter this agreement (the hostage experience notwithstanding).

What I like about this solution is that it can be applied as a layer on top of existing systems without having to otherwise change those systems. For example, the criminals can enter this agreement without changing the dynamics between the criminals and the police and can do so without the consent of the police.

The example above breaks down in two situations:

1) There are actors outside the contract system. In the prisoner's dilemma, what do the criminals do to secure the cooperation of an outside witness? How do you prevent overfishing from countries that refuse to pass or enforce laws preventing ships from their nation from overfishing?

2) The actors have nothing to use as a hostage.

To address the first case, the hostage you stake has to be something you can weaponize. For example, the criminals could stake a large sum of capital instead of a loved one. As long as the stake can be used to apply negative incentives against external actors somehow, you can use it to fix local incentives. For example, the criminals could make a conditional assassination contract against any witnesses and leak the information about this contract to the witness before they speak to the police or testify in court. This solution can be combined with a dead man's switch so no active actions are required by the criminals to enforce it.

In the second case, you have to find some kind of negative outcome to enforce. The most common stake-of-last-resort example is the safety or life of the defector. For example, in The Dark Knight, The Joker made each criminal literally implant bombs into themselves. Assuming we can bootstrap reputation systems, reputation is a much saner collateral for less extreme use cases. That's basically all your credit score is when Visa grants you a credit line without collateral. I like the idea of using reputation collateral better than having to implant oracle controlled bombs into everyone before we would have a chance at fighting climate change in any case.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14uphdc/daily_general_discussion_july_9_2023/jrd0z9e/)

What a day! 

After waiting 49 days in the queues (Rocketpool and then Beaconchain) my mini-8s were scheduled to go active online at 1am this morning. During the entire day I checked my logs several times and felt confident everything looked good to go. Set an alarm and I slept right through it. Woke up 2 hours later and logged in to see how things looked. Failure. No attestations. Losing Eth. Fortunately, the friendly people in the Rocketpool discord immediately identified the problem and I was up and running  within an hour. Fast forward to just a bit ago and I got a proposal! Not a huge amount, but still my APR is at 42% on one of my minis.  Day 1! So tired, but gawdamn I feel like I've won a little lottery!

Anyway, no one really here to share this with, except you fantastic people!

<summary>u/T0Bii explains MEV for those who are out of the loop</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14whcr5/daily_general_discussion_july_11_2023/jrkw161/)

Not sure if trolling since I've seen you around for a while, but just in case someone comes around with no idea of MEV:  

MEV = maximum extractable value is the reward a block builder can get by ordering transactions in a way that profit them.   

Example: Someone makes a buy transaction on uniswap with up to 5% allowed slippage (bad idea). A bot will see this and create two further transactions. One to buy the same token (increases the price) and one to sell it again.  

The the bot will submit a transaction bundle containing their buy transaction (increasing price), the victims buy transaction (increasing price) and their sell transaction (profiting from increased price) in this exact order.  

This is called a sandwich attack and will earn them some money. 

But other bots will be doing the same thing, so in order to actually be the one included in the block, they'll also promise some money to whoever builds the block. 

The money extracted by the bot and the reward for the validator is called MEV.  

There are a lot of different kinds of MEV. Bad MEV like sandwich attacks, "good" MEV like DEX arbitrage which result in efficient markets.   

In order to profit from MEV you could a) build a MEV bot (very very high effort) b) solo stake ETH (reasonable effort, high capital investment), buy LSDs like rETH.  

This is very simplified, there are a lot of nuances around MEV. Feel free to research proposer-builder separation (PBS) and flashbots.

There's all sorts of cool projects in there e.g. for stakers ([Ethereum on ARM](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x3cd765379fd22fb33bf953239281b69ee2fc544adddd597f2493d8745ce0d904), [EthStaker](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x968ae0b1824bcae833efdc68a7cfa726a310a778743c159845593d853dbb6305), [Stereum](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x51d64bf9b8adcacefc7b5c64baa8fabf97046c58a13372266a0458b703860a32), [Rhino Review](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x800ad1e9beac6d65161e61de4550062d8d07a487206ce52d13197f2501df8bdd)), core protocol development ([Protocol Guild](https://clr.fund/#/recipients/0x627b701e00818efb468f0c5a708533ce145c360eedf7585c3cf592f776b16215), [ethers.js](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xc54a972fa079fcc9c53e0b4481a2c943298cb921f30b8c05c9bd878e01b936d1)), different FOSS ([LexDAO chatbot](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xfdd983e8d342aa14343c12211324f27b0732321e39c654fdf4d3f565967b65f1), [rotki](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x8c5e1f713de7e6a18768d9ebe96c8bf897d462d14cfc75a12725fc9868e93913)) and meetups (mainly in Latin America, e.g. [Ethereum Lima](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xd8c9ba3b7c09ef6bfaf02edbba6318db28de04cf1d4bb0709b8bdf9b929f6eff)).

Remember that even a small donation matters! Clr.fund uses [quadratic funding](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xd8c9ba3b7c09ef6bfaf02edbba6318db28de04cf1d4bb0709b8bdf9b929f6eff) to allocate funds from the matching pool to projects, meaning projects with many small donations get more from the matching pool than projects with fewer, larger donations!

18 days left to participate, gas prices are relatively low again so might be a good time to contribute! ü´∂

<summary>u/Set1Less explains Coinbase's latest move in their lawsuit with the SEC</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14lvn8p/daily_general_discussion_june_29_2023/jpyrmd2/)

Dismissal is not realistic right away, but Coinbase still makes compelling arguments. 

Mainly centered around the fact that even in 2021 confirmation hearing, Gensler says SEC doesnt have legislative authority to regulate crypto exchanges. Before SEC, even as a professor Gensler has said the same thing many times. Pre- gensler, Hinman speech is cited where SEC indicates even an ICO coin though a security at the time of issuance can eventually become decentralised and no longer a security 

Then out of nowhere in 2022, contrary to Genslers own testimony and SEC's earlier position, the SEC came up with the "come in and register" mandate, that every token is a security, and started suing various exchanges without even once engage in any rule making. All of this without any new law from Congress. Coinbase bring up Major questions Doctrine which means significant unresolved questions are not down to agency interpretation but require actual lawmaking 

There is an outside chance that the judge decides to throw SEC's case out. But even otherwise, I fully expect Coinbase to litigate this to circuit appeal and then to SCOTUS where the SEC is on a much weaker footing and Coinbase can win a lot of key battles

[u/Syentist](https://reddit.com/u/Syentist):

With today's Supreme Court decision on the student loan relief plan (which, for the record, I find unfortunate, so spare me the downvotes), it's extremely likely that the SEC case against Coinbase would be dismissed if it escalated to the supreme court, under their Major Questions Doctrine 

The administrative state is being gutted by this Supreme Court, for better or for worse (depending on which side of the aisle your views are). If Gensler had any sense, he would push his party members in Congress to work with the Repubs to have *some* form of regulations passed, instead of watching the agencies' jurisidictipm eroded by the courts bit by bit. But political ambitions mask common sense, so no chance of that happening sadly.

[u/pr0nh0li0](https://reddit.com/u/pr0nh0li0):

Lotta big news out of the SCOTUS today but just want to point out something lesser noticed that was just announced that could have big implications for crypto (and a ton of other things for that matter). They announced [they would hear Jarkesy v. SEC in the fall session](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/sec-s-use-of-in-house-judges-will-get-us-supreme-court-review).

It raises a few issues, but one of the most important elements of this case is that the plaintiff alleges that his constitutional right to fair trial was violated, or as the fifth circuit put it when it opined in favor of the plaintiff:

> The SEC ‚Äúoften acts as both prosecutor and judge, and its decisions have broad
consequences for personal liberty and property‚Äù ... that "flies in the face of ‚Äúthe Constitution,‚Äù which ‚Äúconstrains the SEC‚Äôs powers by protecting individual rights and the prerogatives of the other branches of government.‚Äù

I actually have mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, I think yes, it's clear the SEC and some other agencies overreach and make some decisions outside of their purview. On the other hand, this could have HUGE implications for all federal agencies, and could make a lot of important federal organizations like the FDA, EPA and FCC pretty toothless. Not to suggest that these institutions are perfect or even particularly good by any means, I just have a fear of how things could look if we neutered them even further and relied on the courts to adjudicate every single violation. No system is perfect but the latter system would be incredibly bogged down and inefficient.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll starts a discussion about the concerning UK online safety bill</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14p9enj/daily_general_discussion_july_3_2023/jqhaob0/)

Do any Brits want to weigh in on the Online Safety Bill which is getting closer and closer to passing? There's a good outline of it here if you're out of the loop: https://proton.me/blog/online-safety-bill

TL;DR: 

> The Online Safety Bill is currently working its way through the UK parliament, and it‚Äôs expected to be passed into law this autumn. This wide-reaching piece of legislation would force any ‚Äúuser-to-user service‚Äù (such as TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter) or search engine that‚Äôs available online in the UK to protect all its users from illegal content and children from potentially harmful content.
> 
> Clause 110 of the Online Safety Bill would allow the UK government to require any ‚Äúuser-to-user service‚Äù to use ‚Äúaccredited technology‚Äù to identify and remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or terrorist content ‚Äúwhether communicated publicly or privately by means of the service‚Äù. 
> 
> In plain English, clause 110 would give the UK government broad powers that would allow it to require any online service available in the UK to monitor all user-generated content on its platform, including its users‚Äô private messages. 
> 
> This is a problem for end-to-end encrypted services, which can‚Äôt access their users‚Äô content. 
> 
> While UK lawmakers have stated they don‚Äôt want to ban end-to-end encryption, the only ways an end-to-end encrypted service could comply with the bill are:
> 
> - Remove its end-to-end encryption
> 
> - Weaken its end-to-end encryption
> 
> - Install client-side scanning
> 
> - Cease providing service in the UK
> 
> UPDATE March 6, 2023: Removed a reference to the Online Safety Bill applying to ‚Äúlarge‚Äù companies. In fact, it would apply to companies of all sizes, placing a large technical burden on many medium-sized and small businesses.

I find this extremely concerning. Apps like Signal and WhatsApp have pledged not to weaken their encryption for such legislation and Signal will straight up leave the UK.

Regarding my personal situation, my lovely girlfriend lives in the UK and I am finishing a degree in NZ for the next year. After that, I plan to move to live with her since she isn't really able to move to NZ in the next few years but long term is a different story. But I genuinely don't want to move to the UK if this goes in to force and it's either illegal to use encrypted messaging apps or not possible to privately communicate with Brits. I know that might seem extreme and I realise that it would be naive to assume such legislation would never come to NZ but for now that's not the case. Plus of course it seems like Apple and Google want to implement client side scanning anyway.

But for me, privacy is a hill worth dying on (well not literally but it's worth fighting hard for and moving to a quiet place in the middle of nowhere for). The way I see it, you cannot have a free democratic society without privacy. Though there may be a slight caveat for if the surveillance tools involve open source client side scanning with transparent and effective detection software but let's face it, that's not how it will be done. There are already too many stories of false positives and cases of guilty until proven innocent and it's clear that legislators are either too stupid to understand the technical problems with backdooring encryption or are malicious and just want more surveillance.

I've got nothing to hide. If you visit me in person you're more than welcome to go through all of my private messages and emails as long as you're only looking at them with your own eyes. I genuinely don't care. But I do care about people being able to hide perfectly normal things if they need to- it's human nature. Plus, in a democracy, there will be things you need to hide to prevent malicious capture of the government by bad actors. This means privacy is worth it even if it means criminals will hide things too (though they'll do that regardless of if there is mass surveillance or not- only normal people lose if legislation like this passes).

Am I going insane or is the average Joe too distracted, complacent and/or stupid to realise how big of an issue such legislation is?

Oh, and if you disagree with me, I'd love to hear why. Having strong opinions is pretty stupid if you're never open to criticism and dissent.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14q5dmj/daily_general_discussion_july_4_2023/jqmmcom/)

There is a disadvantage to this great improvement though: you stop receiving your rewards every 5 days. If you want to extract your yield periodically, you have to unstake and sell and restake regularly.

With all the delays implied, during which you get 0 APR, is it worth compounding? You can already compound by buying rETH or using an exchange, without locking your rewards nor unstaking.

**Due to this drawback, will whales and exchanges really use this new system ? I doubt it , so I doubt that the number of validators will significantly decrease (which is the goal).**

I'm afraid that we will end up with either rotating validators (the first idea suggested long ago to solve the problem) or a simple onboarding halt at 1M validators: the system stops processing the entry queue which grows and is only advanced each time an active validator exits.

From ZombieBP on Discord:

Hey everyone, if anyone is interested. my EVMavericks Origins level is now live and available to play on Unity Play!

Couple things;

- I temporarily removed the Metamask login, I have to fix a couple bugs there on the WebGL build. But I thought I'd launch the game without it so you guys can play now.
- This is a demo release. I'm sure there might be a couple bugs or some things might not look right on your screen vs others. If you find any bugs or UI issues in the game, let me know and i'll fix them and update the game on the next version.
- This game isn't Mobile compatible yet. I haven't programmed any Mobile controls so if you try to play using your phone right now you'll probably die in the game and won't get very far. So please use your Desktop or Laptop to play
- I forgot to put a controls section in the game (this is another thing I have to add), but its A = move left, D = Move right or left, right arrow keys and Space bar to jump
- Press Enter to skip beginning cutscenes

Have fun, I hope you can beat my level haha. There are exactly 32 Ethereum (in-game) tokens in the game level. See if you can collect them all.

We're roughly halfway through the journey I described in [A Vision of Ethereum - 2025](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pgcbar/a_vision_of_ethereum_2025/)

Running behind schedule, but at the same time, I think the pieces are falling into place. We need better integration of smart wallets across L2s and their apps, and there's progress being made there. One area where there's been very little progress in the last couple of years is in the application layer - but that might be OK, even with the existing applications and usecases live or in development there's plenty to grow as UX improves to what's described in that post.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14gpcpl/daily_general_discussion_june_23_2023/jp7clrk/)

You know what's one of the best part about this community, at least for me? There is not only a lot of knowledge, but also so much talent. I don't stalk people (really, I don't... or do I?), but when you follow EVMs on twitter and check their bios... oh my... so many cool projects in the bios, big names etc. 

So some time ago I started following this [account](https://twitter.com/heeey_eth) on twitter, because despite not having an EVM PFP the name sounded familiar. Turns out I was right, it's u/heyheeyheeey 

So they started posting [pics](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FujIJKsWYAEKljy) and we started DMing, because I love the art. Some posts are about NFTs from another collection, but they started experimenting with generative art themselves and imo they are very very talented. Apparently I am not the only one that loves it and soon (August 7th) heeey will launch their collection "bright" on Art Blocks. Yes, you read that right, [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/collections/presents/projects/0x99a9b7c1116f9ceeb1652de04d5969cce509b069/448). 

So, save or buy some ETH cause we are going to mint some jpgs in August. And if we don't, then I am even happier cause that means heeey's art was so in demand that they are rich now because of a rather high mint price. In any case just being featured on Art Blocks is a great achievement, so congratz heeey!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14hjvmz/daily_general_discussion_june_24_2023/jpbcfjj/)

The most beautiful thing about mankind isn't his ability to understand the world as it is, it is to imagine the world as it isn't and shape it. The denizens of the deepest parts of [The Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole/), the areas furthest from common understanding, are dreamers. They can imagine a world where you are in control of your data instead of monopolistic companies, where identity theft is practically impossible, and where your data isn't monetized and weaponized against you. They can imagine a world where you can contribute to common efforts, at whatever cadence you want, and receive fair rather than predatory compensation by doing so. They can imagine a world where honesty is rewarded, where reputation carries more weight than money on deciding things that matter, and where the best amongst us are elevated and empowered to maximize their potential. They can imagine a world where those harming us are held accountable, where violence is only required as a response to violence, and where there is always a pathway to redemption for those willing. They can imagine a world where coordination seems easy, where the actions of humanity are in alignment with our values, and where we are free to act together to shape the world of our dreams without asking permission to do so.

I can cite specific teams, projects, and people who are imagining all these things and shaping the world in small and large ways to bring their imagination to life. There is technology behind all of these things. It is developing right here, right now, even in the bear market when sentiment is at its lowest. They are making it real as much as they are able to in a largely uncaring and cynical world where every incentive is aligned to enshrine the status quo. In the face of active hatred from the willfully ignorant, in the face of oppression, threats, and violence by the government, the best amongst us are doing these things anyway.

To those of you sticking it out right now after seeing a Tornado Cash dev get locked up without charges for over a year, after seeing the SEC work with SBF but sue Coinbase, and seeing scams proliferate and society turn against you, you are heroes too. The institutions all want us to have to ask permission. They want that so they can say no, grant control to their donors, and protect the status quo. I dislike the status quo; that's what makes me a dreamer. So I say no thank you to them. This technology cannot be bottled and stolen by Nestle and the like. It cannot be captured by a court order or an unelected bureaucrat somewhere. In the game we are playing, every country has a chance to defect from a strategy of oppression and reap economic rewards for doing so. The impacts of what we are building today will be realized over many generations, but society grows great when people plant trees they will never live to sit in the shade of. So we are dreaming of forests... and planting trees.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14j7oa4/daily_general_discussion_june_26_2023/jpmcq74/)

How has no CEX yet enabled a full history statement?! 

Coinbase allows you to generate a report of all transactions in a nice pdf with your account details, but cannot include deposits and withdrawals. 

Kraken allows you to download a full ledger of all kinds of transactions/deposits/withdrawals etc, but only as a spreadsheet without account details. 

Another one I use is similar to Kraken but cannot do a full account history, only up to one year at a time. 

How is it so hard for these companies to put together an account statement function that can include all of the above?!

Edit: WOW! Holy fuck the incompetence. 

Speaking with Coinbase chat support, they send me a link to a document‚Ä¶ a gain/loss report of ANOTHER PERSON‚ÄôS account! Including their full name and email address. Presumably that person has my details now too. WTAF!

Edit 2: As soon as I pointed out what had happened, the initial customer service agent did not respond and passed me to someone else. The second agent tried to ignore the data breach but eventually said that as far as they could see my data was not shared. They provided some further advice to find my deposit/withdrawal history which entailed logging out of my account‚Ä¶ that ended the secure chat (which I suspect was a ploy to get rid of me). So I began another chat with a third agent who looked into the issue and asked for the name of the user‚Äôs data I was sent, they then escalated it and I‚Äôm awaiting next comms from Coinbase. In the meantime I have contacted a law firm to discuss what‚Äôs happened, I‚Äôm not normally one to pursue mistakes by customer service agents but this is a serious data breach and it was initially handled extremely poorly.

<summary>u/the_swingman assesses Ethereum's security-ness</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/144vs24/daily_general_discussion_june_9_2023/jnkjawu/)

While I believe most of us here already deduce that Ethereum is not a security. I'll share some of my thoughts and thought process on the matter.. sorry in advance if this is a bit scattered and long.. 

Ethereum is in a constant state of evolution. Sounds obvious to us, but that concept probably isn't so obvious to people not as well versed in the functionality of Ethereum. When I say this, I am thinking of a court room full of jurors, lawyers, a judge, etc. I am thinking about law makers, house of representatives and the senate; congress. Just listening in on recent hearings lets us know that there are a lot of people in powerful positions who are either un/ill informed or just flat out have a different agenda when it comes to cryptocurrency, let alone Ethereum. Etheruems' constant state of evolution is important to note because while I believe Ethereum can get close to a final form, even then, there will be new frontiers and boundaries that I think Ethereum can explore and expand on to. 

Each stage of evolution in Ethereum has attracted different collectives of people. In the beginning, the idea of Ethereum in its simplest form, thought to be a programable Bitcoin-like entity; a decentralized smart contract platform that extended the capabilities of blockchain technology. If you read Vitaliks whitepaper, a lot of eye opening ideas were conceptualized, and the first question on your mind if you wanted to be involved/interreact was, how do I acquire some Ethereum. In the early groups of Ethereum enthusiasts, you had builders/creators, investor/speculators, researchers and general crypto enthusiasts who saw that whitepaper as groundbreaking.   

I don't believe it was as black and white as: 

```
	A. I am an investor. 
  
	B. I invest to make money. 
  
	C. If I invest in Ethereum, I expect to make a profit.
```
 
The intial ICO wasn't a VC pitch, or promoted to a room full of investors with the promise of profit. It was however, a way to start funding projects on this new platform in exchange for giving people a way to interact with the network/platform by holding/using ETH as well as the potential for growth in value.   

Society/Capitalism would argue that a profit expectation was present, especially if you were to compare the scenario to Bitcoin and Bitcoins historical growth in value at the time. While that may be inherent, it would be very difficult to prove that expectation as an absolute.

Eventually, when a court is deciding on how to classify ETH, and the court is reviewing the intital allocations of Ethereum and the intent behind those allocations, although probably more centralized in nature than we'd all prefer it to have been, I believe there will be enough transparancy to make strong arguements against the criteria of the howey test. Especially if the current environment of Ethereum is to be considered. 
 
With all of the latest developments of Ethereum; Defi, NFTs, DApps, DAOs, Tokenization/Crowdfunding, Supply Chain Management, Web3, etc. Todays Ethereum attracts a new collective of people, while fulfilling the initial vision of Ethereum. I personally know people who are indirectly involved with Ethereum and didn't purchase ETH with an expectation of direct profit, but were more interested in acquiring a loan or an NFT. Point is, there is a rather large and expanding ecosystem and community in Ethereum, one that makes the ETH token a utility in order to move about/participate within said ecosystem and community. As Ethereum continues to scale and more dApps and use cases come to surface, it will be increasingly difficult to classify Ethereum as a security. 

Basic principles of that would signal a non security are: Ethereum has always prioritized decentralization and is decentralized. Ethereum has always been developed open-source and has been community driven and the ETH token was primarily designed as a utility token to interact with smart contracts and is still used that way today. 

The regulators can try to apply old tests and laws to Ethereum, but I believe the outcome will be adapted tests and perhaps new laws likely favorable to Ethereum.  I am as much an investor as I am someone who just uses Ethereum for utility at this point. I have open defi loans, I have NFTs, I have contributed to DAOs and use dApps. These law suits were a long time coming (it seems like the markets feel this way too) and my (our) real hope we end up with actual framework and clarity with path forward for innovation in the US and to finally be rid of regulation by enforcement that triggers these nasty FUD headlines.

[View on kbin ‚Üí](https://kbin.social/m/ethfinance/t/12992/Daily-General-Discussion-June-12-2023#entry-comment-54255)

Hi all and welcome to kbin and m/ethfinance, our temporary-and-maybe-someday-more home while reddit learns its lesson.

I didn't get a chance to reply to everyone in the previous thread, but I did read. Please feel free to ask me any questions about kbin, Lemmy, the fediverse, and I'll try to answer. I've spent quite a few days now exploring it. I also encourage fediverse users to chime in, whether it's from Mastodon experience or somewhere else.

The dev (@ernest@kbin.social) is lovely, responsive, and working hard right now. Feel free to chip in with suggestions at m/kbinmeta or if you have web dev experience, maybe consider reaching out directly to help.

No doubt you're all noticing kbin is slow. It's good to remember that the beauty of federated (decentralized) servers is also in the initial brutality. Servers can be run by anyone (great!) but servers must be run by someone (oof). Ernest is one guy, spinning up a server for refugees of a global conglomerate. It's partly why I tried -- and will keep trying -- to open a server of our own.

I'd encourage everyone to have a little patience, be extra kind and gracious, and at worst, take a little time away from the screen if it's crawling. They're planning a large infrastructure change next week. In the meantime, try to enjoy the brave new world here. We haven't had a truly "new" website to explore in many years. It's kinda exciting!

Now back to the memes, lines, and triangles.

Checking in after my post about taking the plunge the other day. Spun up my validator and deposited. Took me, in total, about 10 hours (yes, really). I'm "Pending" on beaconcha.in.

I wrote down a lot of what I felt and did while trying to get it all together. I'm still kind of shell-shocked by the whole experience and I'm sure I'll talk a lot more about it later. What I'll say for now is that even the "for dummies" version of setting up a validator is significantly more intimidating and intense than most people think it is.

I'm proud of myself for (hopefully) successfully doing it, but even doing it on easy mode (dappnode) had a lot of issues, things that I didn't fully understand, or things that almost had me giving up (I gave up about 3 times and then went right back to it after 5 minutes of having given up).

To be absolutely clear, that's no one's fault but mine. I'm absolutely tech illiterate, but, sadly, I'm actually probably more tech-y than most people. So I do think we have a long way to go before this sort of thing becomes something non-tech can just pick up and do. Things that I think most here take for granted are very scary or even indecipherable to someone like me.

That actually brings me to something that this whole reddit fiasco has me thinking about. One of the great strengths of crypto and eth in particular is the layer 0 stuff. It leads to great communities like this or Ethstaker. We have Reddits and Discords which are filled with people willing and eager to help. The problem is that it seems like it may have led to less focus on delivering a user-manual that makes sense to a new user who has no idea what they're doing. Communities are great for fixing problems, but it seems like we rely on a nebulous social network to teach the basics. Even the best guides I found seemed to assume a lot of knowledge and I generally had 3-5 "1 stop shop" guides open at once as I did this.

The good thing with how tough it was was that, if everything works out and I start validating in a month and a half (thanks Celsius), I'll really feel like I earned it.

[View on kbin ‚Üí](https://kbin.social/m/ethfinance/t/14187/Daily-General-Discussion-June-13-2023#entry-comment-60732)

An incredibly simple example of how to mislead by omission...

A Tweet by Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple.

> 10/ On June 4, Hinman wrote that he didn‚Äôt see a ‚Äúneed to regulate ETH as a security‚Äù and would **call Buterin later that week to confirm ‚Äúour understanding.‚Äù**

Emphasis is added by me, because that section is one of the things causing the XRP bagholders to tweet about '#ETHGate'.

<https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601236344692737>

It is clearly written to imply a shady agreement between Hinman and Buterin. However, in context the quote from the e-mail reads:

*We also have a call with Buterin later this week to confirm our understanding __of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.__*

So what this bellend is insinuating indicates some dodgy deal, is actually just a reference to a call checking some information.

I really do hate the way spreading disinfo is seen as a perfectly acceptable tactic by assholes to get what they want. If you don't strive for truth then you do not deserve to have people listen to you, but so many people don't really want truth, they just want feel special for knowing about a conspiracy and to believe things that will pump their bags.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/148yyad/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2023/jo5690p/)

I get all the drama around Reddit API, but I want to point out something : so far, Reddit is *by far* the social network that is the most crypto-friendly. They onboarded millions of normies eith their Vault, community tokens and Digital Collectibles.

Just something to keep in mind while our community ponder its options.

<summary>u/PhiMarHal has your daily hit of hopium</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/148yyad/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2023/jo5orfq/)

I got your hopium, fam.

Tech is more solid than ever. Rollups make great strides, each in their own direction. Transactions get cheaper, design space extends.

AI is complementary with crypto. AI is the content engine. Crypto is the curation engine. An abundance, an infinity of content makes curating this content for relevance that much more important.

Innovation is happening at the app layer. Uniswap v4 was announced yesterday. Autonomous worlds is picking up as a concept.

We are right where we were in 2019. With everyone declaring crypto dead, and usecases "nobody" expected about to mature in a couple of years.

In a vacuum, I would add that however, we can't be sure this will be reflected in the price as the last ATH went quite high. But this is where the real hopium shot comes in: great future multipliers are forged in the despair of many. When perception hits maximum pain while reality speaks of fundamental soundness still, those are the times of asymmetric opportunities.

In the end I'm just another wanker on the Internet, but I bought ETH today. I wasn't a buyer for the past 3 months. This is financial advice.

* New consumer protection of imposed Individual Blockchain investment limits of approx. 5% of Net Income.
* Rules for Categorization of Blockchain projects for the purpose of Jurisdiction for SEC or CFTC, with a grace period for projects to become decentralized

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13x8njw/daily_general_discussion_june_1_2023/jmhqlh8/)

EthStaker published a blog post to do a call to action for execution client diversity - Nethermind and Besu are ready for adoption in home operators but also for large scale staking operations as yorickdowne, who's part of EthStaker, notes with his setup testing for Cryptomanufaktur.

Geth controls ~87% of the network right now a bug would be a catastrophic situation - say a bug happened where Geth produced an invalid block - most validators would follow it and we'd have to resort to one of three choices at the social layer:

1. Penalize and slash 87% of validators
2. Exit 87% of validators
3. Go with an invalid chain

Any option we chose would shake people's faith in the immutability of Ethereum. The first one would be a massive amount of capital loss. And this is just one of three types of bugs - the most unlikely type of a bug, a double-signing event caused by a bug in Geth, would cause a total slash of 87% of validators. I mean all of it, people running Geth would lose their entire stake.

Super unlikely bugs but we're ready for it and I'm sure that Geth is ready for the people to take the pressure off of them!

üïµüèª Dissecting the FAKE Orbiter "Airdrop" announcement that u/Dreth [warned](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13x8njw/comment/jmg2reh/) everyone about earlier on:

&#x200B;

üö® *"Due to major success of our "Orbiter Pilots NFT Series", we have decided to launch our token $ORB"* ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ Grammatically wrong: Missing "the".. As in: "due to THE major success"

üëâ Logically wrong: Why would a company suddenly "decide" to launch an airdrop based on the success (?) of an NFT Series?

üö® \*"We will be giving away 5,000,000 $ORB tokens, which will be distributed to anyone who claims from June 1st - June 3rd"\*‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ when announcing Airdrops, legit projects release extensive information on their token allocation. Usually multiple pages long, filled with all kinds of relevant information. NOT just a plain number..

üëâ .. and they don't distribute their token to.. "anyone who claims.."

üö® *"There is only a limited amount of token so act fast!"* ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ here they try to create a sense of urgency, to make you act before you think, before you notice all these red flags.. Also, notice the spelling mistake (token instead of token**s)**

üö® *"Those who receive the tokens will be whitelisted to use our newest staking feature"* ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ here they are baiting ("whitelisted") you again, trying to shift your attention from all the red flags by promising "new products" that can give you with extra yield/rewards..

üö® *"Any gas spent on claiming the tokens will be refunded via Orbiter Finance's Smart Contract"* ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ in other words: "Don't worry about high Gas!! Go one and claim NOW!! We'll refund everything!!". I.e. don't wait, don't look further into the legitimacy of this! Go ahead and hastily ignore any sense of "danger", and sigh these txs NOW!

 üö® *Claim $ORB here:* [*https://orbiter*](https://orbiter) *DOT pm/*  ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ DOT PM? Using the "orbiter" brand to lure you into a fake sense of security. But dot pm? WTF is that??

üö® *PILOTS! Our distribution is now 77% claimed üõ∏* ‚ò†Ô∏è

üëâ the number keeps "going up".. First 66%, then 77%, and so on.. QUICK, ACT FAST (**AND DON'T STOP TO THINK**) TOKENS ARE RUNNING OUT!!

Thanks a bunch for signaling your support to prevent Lido from harming Ethereum's decentralization yesterday. I'm glad to see that this problem is as important to you as it is to me.

<summary>u/stablecoin educates us on Gnosis Chain validators</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13y3hr6/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2023/jmoid77/)

Have to give my public support for Gnosis chain after a few posters recommended I run a node on my spare staking PC. 

You can spin up a validating node with just 1 $GNO token. It‚Äôs the base token for the network collateral /staking, but funnily enough you need xDAI to pay fees so make sure to also transfer in $1.0 in dai to your deposit address. 

You can stake like a whale too if you wanted, for about $7500 you can run 64 nodes that‚Äôll probably net you 10-20 block rewards per day. Yield is around 16% which is just high inflation rewards, and so far there‚Äôs nothing in block rewards because tx are too cheap and there‚Äôs no MEV boost I don‚Äôt think. Gnosis Chain also hasn‚Äôt had their withdrawal fork yet so your locking up a little bit longer than ETH right now, but there‚Äôs no entrance queue either to earning. 

The reason for the recommended is it uses the same software clients as ETH (geth, nethermind, lighthouse, prysm, maybe a few others now but not all are supported just yet). It‚Äôs literally a mini-me ETH network with its consensus and execution separated, using the same software clients you just select the Gnosis chain in your startup flags. I used Somer Esat guides to do all this, and just cross referenced the official setup guide from the Gnosis website (below).

If you are curious about staking at home, or looking to enhance your own Etherum node operating skills, running a Gnosis node is like training or studying using real money. For me that always forces me to take it seriously and even enjoy the process more, in addition to leveling up my own skills. You just get a good a feel for how the clients interact with eachother, and also how well your node links up to the network and other nodes. If you really mess up, then you are only out $116 per node rather than $60k. Plus, you are helping to decentralize transactions on a low cost Etherum aligned EVM sidechain. This further broadens the reach of EVM smart contract developers and gives you something constructive to do during ü¶Ä szn.

<summary>u/T0Bii covers the Reddit API pricing drama</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1401prr/daily_general_discussion_june_4_2023/jmvuz00/)

Ya'll probably already heard about the [reddit api pricing drama](https://reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), but for those who didn't: Reddit is getting greedy and is going to charge a ridiculous amount of money for the use of their API, thereby driving third party clients out of business.   

There's not much information about who will have to pay for what etc., but assuming that every API request will have to be paid for, this is the calculation I'm making for the [u/nitter_not_twitter](https://reddit.com/u/nitter_not_twitter) bot:  

I'm currently checking the subreddit 6x per minute. I could reduce this to something like once every 5 minutes and I suppose it would still provide a good UX.   

That'd be 12 requests per hour, 288 per day and 8640 per month.  
The bot answered 170x in the past month as well so we're at 8810 requests per month, or ~106k requests a year.   
According to what we know, reddit wants to charge $12k for 50 million requests. That's $0.00024 per request or ~$25 for the 106k/year.   

**25$/year for running a very small bot** at 12 checks per hour instead of the current 360 checks per hour (which would be insanely costly).   

I can afford that without a problem, assuming reddit will offer packages that small and at the same price.    

But this still shows how insane the API pricing is.   

Without 3rd party apps I'll not be here as often as I currently am and this might be true for a lot of people here as well.   

Maybe we should also think about joining the prostest: <https://reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/   >

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1412u9x/daily_general_discussion_june_5_2023/jn25rci/)

Alright, well here ya go. Our own little reddit alternative.

Welcome to [EVM Lemmy](http://evmav.ddns.net/). Our home away from home when we take down reddit on the 12th.

See below, then... Play around. Make some shit. Post some shit. I'll polish it up as we go.

Remember I've never admin'd a site in my life so... Anything and everything is subject to me trying to fix an issue and accidentally deleting all our data so... yeah, screenshot anything important anyone says.

SOME. CAVEATS.

Obviously, you'll notice it's on http only not https. Because I can't get the damn SSL cert to work. So, NO serious info should be entered here beyond your usual junk email and a junk password. It's PROBABLY just me with access to the data but like, idfk, it's http, trust nothing. Please just meme around and try to break the site, and skip entering your banking information and private keys.

Then if anyone can kindly explain why the [http://url](http://url) works in every browser of mine EXCEPT my main Brave browser, I'd appreciate it. Edge is fine. Firefox is fine. In fact, I can access it in a Brave Private window, just not the main. Why? What setting is on blocking http? Hell, I can even do it from Brave on my phone, same wifi network and pihole DNS and everything. Confused, I am.

And it's also not actually federated because it's 99% me not being able to figure it out yet and 1% apparently there's some outbound DNS issue with Lemmy instances the devs are working on. Idk.

tl;dr servers are hard. yall need to be paid more.

Cheers.

Despite the best efforts of fellow redditors, I have to call it quits for now on the Lemmy instance. I'm just not smart enough. Perhaps I'll return to it.

In the meantime, please find our ethfinance alternative at [https://kbin.social/m/ethfinance](https://kbin.social/m/ethfinance). It's all set up and ready to go, and it's federated. Think of Kbin as the scrappy newcomer ProtonMail to Lemmy's Gmail. 

I'll leave it at that on here, but I'm happy to help people tour the fediverse in the Daily on Kbin. We'll waive the "on topic" rule for a few days so folks can acclimate.

<summary>u/austonst shares a recent EthResearch post about beaconchain security</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1424agt/daily_general_discussion_june_6_2023/jn4rg6o/)

New ethresear.ch post by mike neuder, francesco d‚Äôamato, aditya asgaonkar, and justin drake.

[*Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE ‚Äì a modest proposal*](https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801)

Also see their [notes on security](https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/meb-increase-security).

Summarizing briefly, this change would keep the 32 ETH minimum for a validator, but increase the *maximum* by some factor (possibly 64x to a max of 2048 ETH). Probability of selection for various duties e.g. sync committee would be weighted based on balance. Operators running multiple validators would not have them aggregated forcibly, but could opt in to have their validators merged.

The authors argue the following benefits:

* BLS signature aggregation is a big part of the consensus protocol. Producing, verifying, and aggregating signatures for the various committees leads to some significant compute overhead which could be reduced with fewer, larger validators.
* [Current proposals](https://ethresear.ch/t/horn-collecting-signatures-for-faster-finality/14219) for single-slot finality (SSF) depend on aggregating signatures from *every validator every slot*. Reducing the validator set size, and with it the number of signatures needed, would reduce the computational cost of doing so, speeding up SSF development.
* SSF is a prerequisite for in-protocol proposer-builder separation (ePBS) and MEV burn, so reducing the validator set size helps speed those along too.
* Anyone with stake below the maximum will have their consensus-layer rewards *auto-compound*, as the increased validator balance smoothly leads to higher attestation rewards and proposal chances. The current lack of this is a big downside to solo staking compared to staking pools.
* Partial withdrawals incur a large withdrawal load every epoch. If validators switch to the larger cap with auto-compounding, there will be 1) fewer validators in total to process partial withdrawals for, and 2) many who stay below the upper limit and don't need regular partial withdrawals in the first place. Ultimately reduces withdrawal queue length.

As with any protocol design choice, there are some tradeoffs involved. Already a couple of good criticisms in the replies which are worth a read.

<summary>u/haurog is feeling quite positive on Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1424agt/daily_general_discussion_june_6_2023/jn3ay32/)

I am feeling quite positive on ETH and Ethereum:

* The most powerful government in the world goes on a full frontal attack on the largest centralized exchange in the world and the overall crypto market cap drops by less than 5% and is now down only 3.5%. Price fluctuation wise, this is just a normal day in crypto. It looks like most people who are non-believers or are over-invested left or reduced their investment. 
* Every time the SEC does not call ETH a security it will get harder to claim it being one later on. Kind of like a Lindy effect.
* Many alt L1 coins have been called a security now. I would prefer if the various approaches to building a modern blockchain would compete on a technical level and not a government restricting new entrants in the space by relative arbitrary and archaic regulations. But all in all this is positive for Ethereum, as I think the number of new "Ethereum killer" VC chains will go down.
* Making it harder for newer chains to do an ICO could end up being extremely positive for ETH as  projects will think hard on how to secure their chain and probably a rollup settling on Ethereum using ETH as the payment token will be the way to go for many of them. 
* For other non-rollup type projects they will have to find a way to secure their project without issuing tokens. Here comes Eigenlayer, which again uses Ethereum.

These are uncertain times, I have no idea which branch of the US government lashes out and attacks crypto next, but I am just feeling positive about the non-reaction of the market and the future ahead for Ethereum.

<summary>u/kainzilla speculates on the SEC's plan</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1433ugu/daily_general_discussion_june_7_2023/jn9tsl1/)

This isn't designed to be FUD, but rather to be realistic about what I expect to happen. Just to be clear, I expect this plan to *fail* at some stage along the way, because I think they let it run too long and it's likely no longer stoppable:

* The SEC is not governing in good faith, they're definitely orchestrating an attack on crypto. It's real easy to see "attacks" where attacks don't exist, but watching the SEC chief do everything possible to not define Ethereum as a commodity **or** a security during the congressional hearings made it extremely obvious that **they're acting with intent.**
* With the fact that they're acting with intent in mind, consider the recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, specifically the parts regarding securities: **some in here believed that it was a positive sign that Ethereum wasn't named. It is not.**
* The SEC's problem is that if they try to get Ethereum declared a security right now, they're very likely to lose that lawsuit. Their game plan in this case is to go after other coins - especially ones that *are* in fact much closer to a security, and after securing a win on these, they intend to try to use that to nail Ethereum next. That's the only reason Ethereum wasn't included in the list, is due to prior SEC comments and actions regarding it. **As soon as they lock in any victories on similar assets, they will try to use this as support for attacking Ethereum.**
* Bitcoin users aren't safe either. I'm pretty sure an additional facet of this plan is that any coins (including Bitcoin) that use Proof-of-Work mechanisms will be targeted by "green / environmental" legislation designed to shut them down / make mining them illegal. **They can't attack those via the SEC, so they're going to try co-opting environmental legislation to shut this side down. With these two prongs, both Proof of Stake and Proof of Work assets will both be covered.** Although I'm pretty sure this will be an aspect of the attack plan, I don't know if it will run concurrently with the SEC attacks above, or if they'll wait until it's known if those will succeed.
* While these plans are in motion, they will continue to attack exchanges in any way they can - "protecting" consumers by making accessing exchanges harder or more onerous, legislation to make self-custody illegal, etc. **We've seen a few older and smaller US-servicing exchanges get shut down over the last year, and I expect them to start attacking Kraken and Gemini soon as well.**

It's crystal clear they're working towards an agenda to shut down crypto as a whole. Tbh I don't give a shit if it's because "hur dur global banking cabal" or "oh fuck the USD is going to collapse if we don't try to shut this down" or "I'm old and fucking stupid and I hate this cryptkeeper blogchain technology", because the reasons are irrelevant; just know that they're working with a coordinated plan here and **Ethereum is on the hit list.** Be realistic about the struggles that are coming.

<summary>u/696_eth reflects on a one year old ratio reminder</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1433ugu/daily_general_discussion_june_7_2023/jncqa6f/)

A few weeks ago I received a reminder to my sale of majority of my BTC to ETH.

At that time in 2022, btc - $30k, eth - $2000, ray - 0.067. 

2023 prices, btc - $26k, eth - $1800, ray - 0.067.

So was that decision good for me and my future?

Some quick reflections combined with guesses-predictions on how things might turn out.

* Due to prices and ratios being really similar, the trade has ended up being neutral. However, there's taxes, hence I ended up loosing like 20%ish and it will probably end up being around 30-35% long term. 
* So one of the cool things for me right now is that I can borrow against my assets on Ethereum, even my ENS digits! I couldn't do that on Bitcoin, I would have needed to wrap it which would've been a tax event, so while it was possible, it was not practical. Borrowing my end up saving me 5-10% long term, we'll see. 
* On top of my Ethereum assets. I have an option to get yield now. The yield is really crucial because it means I have an option of getting something without sacrificing my stack and cashing out. 
* This leads me to my next point. My latest variation of the initial crypto plan was to cashout into USD or stocks, just away from the bitcoin, cause I needed to have money somehow to pay for stuff. They were not many bitcoin developments. Yes, it started being accepted here and there, mostly digitally. Anyways, that's not the point. But the most useful use case to me was being able to send money quick and fast and relatively cheaply.
* Well, now I don't have to live. Quite on the opposite. It has also been cool cause there's so many things going in the Ethereum ecosystem or around it. I'm sure waaaay more people used Ethereum than Bitcoin. 
* There's actually something here than just pure money and just waiting for the next halving and next bull run in hopes of more money. In the years before, I actually had people IRL ask me 'why would they buy Bitcoin and what utility it had?'. And for the decent amount of recent years, bitcoin community's proposition wasn't for P2P, which initially was soo cool for me, but more just to hodl this to have more money and that's it lol.
* This bear market has the most fun. Somewhat stressful too compared to other ones where you just zone out cause there was not much going in btc. But yeah, it's pretty cool. I get to learn a lot and try out things I wanted to do in my life before. For example, I wanted to write before but I didn't like college essays cause of word limit bs. I wanted to write but I didnt really know where to put 'writing' into my life, I did write a few things here and there, mostly psychology and mental health related but that's about it. And since becoming involved in the communities here and in the ecosystem, I can do some writing and it works for me. And there's so much room for growth too.

It's getting pretty long and my flow is a bit off so here's a few btc related takes.

* I'm really interested seeing what happens when for the first time after halving when btc doesn't hit new ATH. It would be a heavy downfall to many holders, I don't think it will go to 0 but I think the main narrative of up only being broken would be a hard pill to swallow. 
* Prob one of the hottest hot takes: I think btc doesn't hit $100k next bull run. But my takes are not know to be correctüòÖ

And if you made it till here, here's my last important point. 

* I've been trying to figure out the differences between my experiences within bitcoin and ethereum communities. To me it was mostly coming down to some social related movements. For example, seeing snippets of btc conferences during 2021 was so criiinge that I didn't wanna be related with that sorta people in any way. On the other hand, there's so many builders, artists, creators, degens and users in Ethereum that I resonate with. It's kinda funny but I met some people who are still not a fan of Ethereum yet they work on some projects that are built on Ethereum and contribute to the ecosystem. I mean they can hold whatever assets they want but if they are spending their energy contributing to this ecosystem rather than contributing to the ecosystem the asset they believe of - maybe it says something. So I was looking for a short simple and best way to describe this whole social thing to start quantifying it someway so I can communicate with people better and pass on my excitement and passion about the space and I have realized that the term already exists - **Layer Zero**. That social layer. It's the actual difference that drives things here, creates collaboration and unity rather than division. 

I'm going to end this here, thanks for coming to my imperfect TED Talk.

All the best,

<summary>u/o-l-o explains how a Trezor randomly generates a seed phrase</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13s3pp7/daily_general_discussion_may_26_2023/jloyeu4/)

With trezor, you can read through their code and understand how they generate seeds.

Someone has already done this: <https://medium.com/@brandonarvanaghi/analyzing-trezor-firmware-mnemonic-seed-generation-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4b03fbaad24d>

You'll notice that that article calls out that the default 'random32' isn't suitable for production (and the code itself wanes you of this), so you'll need to find out where Trezor implements 'random32'. This is my first time looking through their code and it seems that the insecure implementation **is** the default implementation in their firmware, but I assume they replace that somewhere. Perhaps someone more familiar can point us to the newest RNG code because THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT TO CLEAR UP. 

They do have a legacy firmware that has its own 'random32' implementation: <https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/92045275fb79e532a5b9a86732c1b3206ef3bba4/legacy/rng.c#L27>

You'll notice that that code uses a few "RNG_" variables to produce it's number, so the next step is to find out what those are.

We know that Trezor uses a Cortex-m4 Arm chip, and this is C code, so we can look at the chip datashet to understand what those do, or we can cheat and look at OpenCM docs: <https://libopencm3.org/docs/latest/stm32f2/html/group__rng__file.html>

You'd also want to go to the datasheet for the STM32F205xx to see that it has a "true random generator" hardware module.

That all looks really good, and I've heard that the modern Trezor firmware also includes static ram and host device data into it's RNG, but I'm not familiar enough with their code to hunt that down at the moment.

Hey guys, lurker here who‚Äôs been working on a project in his free time: https://betonchain.gg/

To keep it brief, I started out running a Chainlink node, deploying jobs and a consumer to update odds and game results data from an API I wrote to aggregate results and odds across various bookies. Eventually the goal became to offer the most competitive betting experience in terms of odds, privacy and transparency, while decentralizing the bookmaker by sourcing house liquidity from a community which receives house profits back. Soon after launch I aim to add support for futures and integrate player friendly tools such as contracts for auto-hedging parlays. 

The platform is currently on Sepolia, if anyone is interested in testing the DApp please drop an address and I can send over some test USDC/USDT/DAI to place bets with. Hopefully there‚Äôs not too many bugs! I am considering launching polygonzkEVM but not sure yet. 

Appreciate any feedback from you fine gents and ladies! 
 
PS: If anyone has insight into raising funds, please let me know, hope to make this my full time job. Thanks again!

<summary>u/superphiz thinks we are hitting a staking inflection point</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13trvpr/daily_general_discussion_may_28_2023/jlxxxt5/)

I think we're hitting an inflection point where staking is the "cool" thing to do with Ether. Lots of folks predicted that this would happen but no one really knew when. I'm basing this on two factors:

1. The deposit queue is growing at an accelerating rate despite long wait times.
2. The price of Eth is beginning to inch up against the flow of other assets.

The logical interpretation of this is that the supply squeeze delivered by staking & burning is finally upon us.

Does this mean Ethereum is successful? 

Nope. Not even close. We saw something similar happen with Dash in 2018 (dash spiked when their staking program reached critical mass), but Dash couldn't keep the gains. The only way Ether will lock in this success is if we build valuable products on top of a credibly neutral and decentralized network. If you're hearing this, but not acting on it, you're a bad puppy üòú

<summary>u/busterrulezzz experiences the Bitcoin BRC-20 and Ordinals user experience</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13trvpr/daily_general_discussion_may_28_2023/jlzjpme/)

I took a deep breath and tipped my toes into Ordinals and BRC-20 yesterday. UX is terrible, it took 12 hours (!) to process my bridging transaction from BTC mainnet to Stacks, and depositing into my trading wallet took about 10 minutes. It's a very, very long time when you're used to Ethereum. Xverse wallet is even worse than MetaMask in terms of showing human-readable information, and all swaps are done either via order books or P2P bulk sales.

The experience is not welcoming for a newcomer. I've been doing DeFi daily for the last 2 years, and I had to look around for hours before I was comfortable enough to do a transaction.

However, I think BRC-20s and Ordinals have a decent chance of becoming more popular in the next few months. I am not tech-savvy enough to understand the hurdles facing a better UX - until yesterday I thought an ETH NFT collection could be bridged back-and-forth to BTC... But I could definitely see how people could pile on Bitcoin DeFi projects.

Ethereum isn't threatened by this, in my opinion. It is so far ahead in terms of development... Bitcoin looks like a 28k modem, while Ethereum is 5G. Still, I decided to allocate a small portion of my trading wallet to it. I feel kinda dirty using a PoW chain, but hey, ride the wave, don't fight it, as they say.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13uldb1/daily_general_discussion_may_29_2023/jm1c67u/)

Hey ! Seems like I'm going to be let go at work soonish (Which is a good thing, my job got less and less technical over the years and I miss that part a lot). I'm a cryptographer with quite good skills in programming in a range of languages, so I was considering having a bit of fun for a couple years working in the ETH ecosystem. What I'm looking for is technical challenge.
  
What are my options ? My thoughts so far :
  
- CL Client teams : Very new codebase (which is nice) - Mainly about implementing EIP specs, seems to be that challenge here is "low" as the heavy lifting is done at the research level.
- EL Client teams : Older codebase - Mainly about improvements of various existing parts - a bit more challenge because there's design/engineering tasks to improve stability and speed/latency/footprint of the clients.
- Research teams : Way more focused on design / cryptography / game theory - Something I'm very good at, but I fear I will miss the coding part of it, which is somthing I enjoy.
- A Layer 2 : I would probably prefer a ZKR since it's more fun to work on, but I kinda think that OR are so ahead in terms of maket share that it's an uphill battle to win as a ZK rollup.
- Some protocol : Probably some game theory involved, but I don't think I like the risk of being part of a project which has a chance of not taking off.
- Do my own thing with a high probability it won't be used : I would love to code some kind of ZK prover in GPU assembly for instance - This is probably the most fun for me, but also the most risky.
- Flavor of the month : Work for a hardware wallet manufacturer with good open source values :)
  
Any other options you can think of ? I'm just in the process of evaluating my opions right now as the switch won't be before a couple months.

<summary>u/nightfallsh4 reminds us of another cool use for your hardware wallets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13uldb1/daily_general_discussion_may_29_2023/jm1d0wh/)

Just a reminder to everyone if you don't know already. 

Both Ledger and Trezor device support Fido U2F, which means you can use your ledger or trezor as a security key (2FA) to login to your online accounts. 

Of course if you are not comfortable taking your hardware wallet with you everywhere, maybe consider using it for online accounts you'll only login from your home or in a safe place. But according to your specific threat model you can use HWs as 2FA security partially or fully in your online activities. 

You can use them to secure your CEX accounts, email, password manager etc. And if you loose or break your device you can always restore it with the seed phrases in another device and all your 2FA security keys will be recovered as well. 

Using a security key as 2FA for your online accounts greatly increases your general security online. And almost impossible to hack into your accounts remotely.

Before you implement that be sure to go through the ledger and trezor articles about using their respective U2F features. 

Trezor also supports FIDO2 standard for passwordless login but it's not as widely adopted yet like U2F.

Edit:- here is trezor's article on using U2F- <https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-u2f>

Here is the ledger's article - <https://www.ledger.com/fido-u2f>

If you're moving away from ledger as your hardware wallet, you can atleast use it as a 2FA security key to secure your online accounts.

Not sure if posted yesterday, but even if it was it's worth repeating. HOP bridge now supports rETH, with joint liquidity incentivization by HOP & RocketPool DAOs.

This is the first liquid staking token bridge (of any protocol) and I'm hopeful HOP can add more. Anyone who is in a LST community that has shown interest in getting a bridge set up let me / HOP know. When this was being voted on it seemed there was interest in adding more.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13wcu4w/daily_general_discussion_may_31_2023/jmbhv0z/)

The Lido situation:

- A total of [19 million eth is staked on Ethereum](https://beaconcha.in/). A total of [6 million eth is staked on Lido](https://lido.fi/ethereum). **More than 36% of all staked eth is staked with Lido**.
- [More than 32% of all validators are using Lido](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=pool&timeWindow=1d&page=1). 
- Lido is the #1 protocol on Ethereum with a TVL of more than $13 billion. [That's more than twice the TVL of the second largest project, Maker](https://defillama.com/). That's close to 6% of all ether in existence.
- The activation of withdrawals by Lido 2 weeks ago [had almost no effect of their TVL](https://app.parsec.finance/layout/wilburforce/dE0XOJyv). Over the past month, [Lido's TVL still grew by 10.8%](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum?tvl=true). **There isn't any reason to expect their share to drop significantly in the future.**

When Prysm contributed to centralization by having too high of a share in the consensus client market, the community launched an initiative aiming at reducing that.   
This worked fantastically and [Prysm went from more than 66% to now being second behind Lighthouse](https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution).

No real initiative has been launched in the case of Lido yet. There is no real equivalent to [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org) today, with explanations, educational material, and guides to switch to less centralized options. There is no real pressure by the community.

Are we really passively waiting for the 33% validator share limit to be crossed in order to start doing anything?? Will one more percent *really* make a difference? As a reminder, [Vitalik suggested that no entity should control more than 15% of all validators](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525301234516652032). **Lido already controls twice the stake Vitalik considers to be too much**. 

On May 22 2022, u/superphiz wrote that [community action should start at a 22% share](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1525479305077309442). With its 32%, Lido has now 50% more than that and yet no action has been seen.

To our Ethfinance friend u/hanniabu who created [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org) (big thanks for that): is there a similar website planned for staking providers? [rated.network](https://rated.network) just doesn't do the education job. Please let me and us know if there is anything we can do to help.

Feel free to share any idea about what we could do to.

This problem won't just solve itself, there needs to be a community initiative.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency explains why you shouldn't burn your scam NFTs</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13kozpl/daily_general_discussion_may_18_2023/jknuv6i/)

Imagine an Ethereum spam token as a small piece of land in the middle of the desert that has a big sign planted in it saying "/u/barthib owns this". You have no idea who put the sign there, and the land is obviously worthless, so why would you bother driving out into the desert to try to claim it or to take down the sign?

TL;DR Hide it. Don't interact with it or try to "get rid of it".

Conceptually speaking, Ethereum tokens (including NFTs) don't exist "in" your address like ETH does. They exist "in" their own token contract that maintains its own separate ledger. This contract's code is determined entirely by the creator of the NFT.

When your wallet software checks your address for tokens, what it's basically doing (through a couple levels of indirection) is pinging the smart contract that the token creator published, asking it "does this address own any of your token? If so, which one(s) does it own?" The token's creator can, if they wish, tell the contract to respond to this inquiry with literally anything. They could tell your wallet that you own an amount of their token equal to the current block number, or randomize every day the tokens the contract says you own, if they wanted to.

When you interact with a token, your wallet is reaching out to the token contract and running the code defined there by the creator of the token, which can also be anything they want. So a situation like this could occur:

* You try to send the token to the null address.
* By doing so, your wallet calls the "transfer" function on that random token contract.
* The "transfer" function is malicious, and tries to trick you into sending the attacker other tokens out of your wallet, or even just reverts (fails) your transaction causing you to lose your gas fee.

**Edit:** A classic scam is where they code the contract to revert/fail your transaction with a custom error message that includes the address of their scam website in it, telling you to go there for "support" on their token. You see your failed transaction with their custom error message when you go on Etherscan to check whether your transaction went through. So you visit their website and get on their support live chat, and they feed you some bullshit about you needing to install a wallet upgrade from a dodgy .exe file, or that your wallet is corrupted and you need to send them your seed phrase to fix it. Then they clean you out.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13migau/daily_general_discussion_may_20_2023/jkvh8t5/)

Heads up for everyone using Google Authenticator 2FA app.  While this might be old needs, the update was pushed around the end of April, this was new to me, so maybe some fellow EthFinanciers might find this useful. 

This morning I opened my Google Authenticator app to find out that is needed an update. The update included a back up of the authenticator codes into my google account.   
When I explored this a bit I found this:   

'With this update we‚Äôre rolling out a solution to this problem, making one time codes more durable by storing them safely in users‚Äô Google Account. This change means users are better protected from lockout and that services can rely on users retaining access, increasing both convenience and security.'

Really, how can they think this is save. The whole point is to have a second step besides your standard login option like Gmail. What's the point of storing your 2FA codes in a google account that when it gets compromised, your 2FA codes are compromised as well. 

There is still the option to keep using the authenticator without the backup feature. 

Remember, when it comes to online security, the ultimate responsibility lies with none other than ourselves. Stay vigilant, take proactive measures, and empower yourself to safeguard your digital presence.

Hi everyone‚Ä¶I just got the final cover for my book back.  I‚Äôve written a little book about Ethereum!!  Specifically about WHY Ethereum is the future of business.  It‚Äôs called (no surprise) ‚ÄúEthereum for Business‚Äù.  If you would like to pre-order it, the paper copy should be in your hands in about 2 weeks as we‚Äôre nicely ahead of the official schedule and orders for eBooks on Amazon or Apple will follow in another 2-3 weeks.  I‚Äôll do a top-level post on why I wrote the book and what it‚Äôs about on the official release day.

# EVMavericks Rocket Pool oDAO update

There was a meeting planned for Monday but too many people could not make it last minute. A few of us had an unstructured discussion mostly about the costs of setting up and running an oDAO node and necessary archive node. u/haurog calculated some of the costs using on-chain activity and is willing to share a doc once complete and here‚Äôs [another great resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loB9U8wCIJn73a1DsR-mJJ9PQaYWMlF9asNc7BgM_zc/edit#gid=1352142799) (oDAO tab).  
We‚Äôd like to maximize participation for those interested in working on the project, so please enter your availability for the next meeting here:

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard thinks now is a good time to familiarise yourself with Curve</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13pejil/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2023/jlb7a9k/)

With crvUSD finally launching in earnest now would be a good time to at least familiarize yourself with the Curve ecosystem if you haven't. It's still the second highest volume DEX and might have just launched a way to double its income.

There's a lot to unpack here:

* Curve issuance. How much is being emitted? When are the scheduled emission reductions? Who is sucking it up?
* Bribes. This is basically a way of reallocating liquidity from a trading fee optimal allocation to a CRV holder revenue optimal allocation. This takes a bit to get your head around.
* Curve v2 pools. These are largely misunderstood. Unlike Uniswap or Balancer Curve v2 pools have a volatility instrument in there that flexes liquidity depth to minimize IL and adjust the target peg over time. This is a seriously undermarketed feature.
* crvUSD. A new CDP style stablecoin that uses a gradual liquidation system so you get less wrecked. Lower risk for borrowers, no need for keepers to liquidate you, and it enables high LTV ratios. This is my favorite DAI-style replacement so far. LUSD puts your collateral at risk even pre-liquidation. RAI famously isn't stable. crvUSD is just an improved design of the liquidation system and the peg can be backed by the entire DEX revenue for a stronger coupon bond failsafe than DAI could ever offer.

I do suggest you spend a few hours and familiarize with this system if you haven't because it is the baseline so many other projects derive their tokenomics from.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi has a delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13pejil/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2023/jlbarvm/)

Not sure if it's been posted yet, but the delegate week started yesterday. If you own any DAO tokens, it's a great time reconsider who you are delegating too. Or even better, if you are on the fence about being a delegate might be a good time to jump into it! 

Some more info here - [https://delegationweek.com/](https://delegationweek.com/) & if you are looking for a list of r/ethfinance delegates check out the daily doots page here - [https://dailydoots.com/#delegates](https://dailydoots.com/#delegates)

If you own any HOP, now would be a good time to consider delegating - whether that is to someone new or just re-affirming with the person you already delegate too. They are using some of the grant funds to encourage people to re-delegate (or delegate if they aren't at all) See - [https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11). Not a huge amount, and I'm not sure if those are the final numbers, but at a minimum should cover some gas costs + some beer money.

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra reflects on a famous crypto saying</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13pejil/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2023/jlbbexm/)

> **Crypto wasn't invented to make you rich...**

I've been in Ethfinance for a few years, and every year, I understand this a little bit more. I joined before the big bull, made some profits, but you don't make life-chaging amounts of money by investing spare change as a broke college student. So I obviously didn't sell during the crazy highs. This year is the year in which I'll be calling myself an "Etherean" for more than I was calling myself a "Bitcoiner".

> **...It was invented to set you free.**

I've got to say, I "converted" to Eth at a good time. Not a good time financially, but at a time where I was disillusioned with Bitcoin. I had heard about Ethereum much earlier, but ignored it, as it was obvious to me that Bitcoiners would not leave the biggest and best coin with *zero* improvements over multiple years, riding on the first-mover advantage alone. What a rabbit hole the Ethereum ecosystem was! What an *insane* potential of improving the way we interact with wealth and capital and as a result the human condition!

> **...But it will make you rich anyway.**

If this part ever comes true, I'm ready, but I hope it's not overnight. I don't know if my mental health can take another insane bull, but I suspect that the next one might be even wilder. At least inflation and time have changed my definition of "life-changing money". In any case... DCA on!

<summary>u/2Nice4AllThis is trying to explain Ethereum for dummies</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13qbpch/daily_general_discussion_may_24_2023/jley82w/)

I‚Äôm working on a few crypto beginner‚Äôs tutorials, with the main goal being to simplify information and for a better learning experience. Ideally, a lot of users don‚Äôt actually need long explanations of how blockchain and dapps work and just want to know how to use them.

Interestingly I wanted to compare simple transacting as copying and pasting an address, and I thought to compare this to being as easy as copying and pasting an IBAN number for digital banking transactions (like in many EU countries). But then it occurred to me that in the US, peer to peer banking transactions are still impossible (which is pathetic), so this reason alone makes explaining this way harder than it should be.

Just a funny observation. What could be a better metaphor for explaining transactions in a ‚Äúcrypto for dummies‚Äù kind of way? I was considering using email addresses as a metaphor, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way.

Also, is lack of p2p banking a problem that fednow is trying to solve? It should be a crime how far behind the US is due to lacking simple digital transactions as a standard feature for all bank accounts. Anyway, people generally understand PayPal and Venmo, but trying to explain crypto transactions automatically sounds way more technical if you‚Äôre not already familiar with similar concepts.

<summary>u/Maleficent_Plankton does a deep-dive on ERC-20 vs BRC-20 tokens</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13edhzt/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2023/jjpilb7/)

##**What is the difference between a BRC-20 token and an ERC-20 token?**

Expanded from my comment in /r/ethereum 

####**TL;DR**:

BRC-20 is **completely different** than ERC-20. It has a similar name, which is very misleading because it works nothing like it.

Both are meant to be fungible.

* **ERC-20**:
  * A full smart contract with complete customizability (usually 8k-12k characters long).
  * It must include all the functions that dictate how the token works, so its code is 100x bigger than a BRC-20 token's code.
  * Each ERC-20 token can behave very differently depending on their contract code
* **BRC-20**:
  * A tiny JSON object (usually 100 characters long)
  * BRC-20 tokens are much more **standardized** and do not include any functional code
  * You can only customize 4 properties: Ticker symbol, max supply, # of decimals, and the mint limit

---

##**What is an ERC-20 token?**

An ERC-20 token requires a **complete smart contract** with a full set of code that describes how the token operates. 

All ERC-20 tokens must have these function names and parameters.

* function name() public view returns (string)
* function symbol() public view returns (string)
* function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
* function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
* function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
* function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
* event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
* event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)

Only their names and parameters must match. **A function's code does NOT have to match the description of its name**

I could make a valid (but scammy) ERC-20 token where the "**transfer**()" function actually mints tokens, and where the "**approve**()" function instead burns a large amount of your transferred Ether. And that would be technically valid as long as the code specifies it.

##**What is a BRC-20 token?**

First off ... documentation on the BRC-20 standard absolutely sucks: <https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/>

I thought it was a joke, but that's the full token standard documentation.

Some more info:

* <https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/examples>
* <https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/brc-20-tokens/>

BRC-20 is just a short JSON object (a simple data structure) and does not contain any functions. It's based on ordinal theory and relies on the ordinal nodes to operate on it and provide it with **standard** functions.

It only works with ordinal-compatible taproot addresses.

**Here is the standard format of a BRC-20 token**:

* **Protocol**: Specifies the type of ordinal transaction. Always "brc-20".
* **Operation** - One of 3 different operations
  * Deploy: Deploys the BRC-20 token
  * Mint: Mints new tokens as long as it's not past the max supply or mint limit
  * Transfer: Mints a transfer function
* **Ticker symbol**: A 4-letter ID
* **Max supply**
* **Mint limit**: Limit per ordinal transaction that users can mint themselves
* **Decimal precision**

This is what the entire ORDI token deployment looks like:

```
{ 
  "p": "brc-20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "ordi",
  "max": "21000000",
  "lim": "1000"
}
```

**Here is the format of a Transfer function**:

* **Protocol**: Specifies the type of ordinal transaction. Always "brc-20".
* **Operation**: Transfer
* **Ticker symbol**: A 4-letter ID
* **Amt**: The amount to transfer

To transfer, it takes 2 steps:

1. Inscribe the transfer function to yourself
1. Send the inscription from your wallet to the other address

Swaps require an off-chain 3rd-party to complete, so they're not safe at the moment. It remains to be seen if you can build trustless DeFi around BRC-20 tokens.

**Some other interesting facts about BRC-20 tokens**:

* BRC-20 tokens rely on ordinals and inscriptions to work. This uses the prunable witness section of a Bitcoin transaction that costs 4x fewer sats per byte.
* BRC-20 Tokens currently account for [**over half of all Bitcoin transactions**](https://dune.com/queries/2432967/3996835)
* BRC-20 tokens are **so small** (in terms of weight) that **Bitcoin TPS has actually [doubled over the past month](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/transactions-per-second)**. This is not due to more demand, but because the average transaction size has gone down (due to fewer batch transactions), so they can pack more Txs into each block.

[u/OkDragonfruit1929](https://reddit.com/u/OkDragonfruit1929):

It wasn't catastrophic, but it easily could have been a serious, but recoverable, issue if it had persisted. Epoch 200,553 only had 40% voting participation, which means only 40% of validators selected at random for block creation were actively confirming new blocks. Normally, the participation rate should be much higher, so this could indicate a problem with the network.

Start of the problem: [https://beaconcha.in/epoch/200551](https://beaconcha.in/epoch/200551)

Normalization achieved: [https://beaconcha.in/epoch/200556](https://beaconcha.in/epoch/200556)

We need a thorough post-mortem before we can be sure everything is okay though, because a rogue event like this happening for no explainable reason would not be very confidence inducing.

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

A tiny update on the loss of finality yesterday: The culprit still isn't clear.

Some people have suggested Prysm caused the issue because they were hit hard by lost attestations and high loads, but this is very likely a side-effect of the turbulence rather than a cause. [Terence](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1656789550948311042) described some optimizations they were making as a result of the turbulence, but that's not an admission of fault.

I initially threw shade on MEV-boost because of my distrust for that stack, but there's no evidence suggesting they are involved in any way. 

The investigation is ongoing and the outcomes will be published in a detailed postmortem.

[Terence just posted another update](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1657021042110631936), but keep in mind, that this isn't a finding of fault, they're just exploring the incident. 

Most clients (except Lighthouse) were hit hard by this, but Prysm stands out because they have a high representation of validators.

> Terence just posted another update  
>  
> , but keep in mind, that this isn't a finding of fault, they're just exploring the incident.

Here's my best attempt at an ELI5:

CL clients were getting a lot of attestations (which are like votes or confirmations from other nodes) about older transactions that didn't include the latest updates. This is like getting a lot of mail about old news that doesn't include recent important events.

Because the nodes that sent these attestations didn't have all the information for the recent transactions, CL clients had to spend a lot of time and resources to catch up. This is similar to how you'd spend a lot of time and effort researching recent events if you only had old newspapers. This caused the CL clients to work too hard and run out of resources, leading to issues like the system slowing down or even crashing.

During this time, a small problem in the Prysm system (which likely exists in other clients as well) was found that made it use the wrong information when trying to organize transactions. It's like sorting mail into the wrong categories because you're using an outdated list.

The Prysm team is working on improvements to prevent these issues from happening again. They're improving the system's memory management, and they're going to implement similar logic which right now only exists in Lighthouse CL clients where they filter out unviable attestations (like disregarding old news that's no longer relevant). The Prysm dev team plans to release these improvements next week.
  
So, in summary, the Prysm nodes were overwhelmed with outdated information, which led to system issues and revealed a minor bug. The Prysm dev team is now working on fixes and improvements. I am hopeful other CL clients follow suit and implement similar fixes.

<summary>u/wolfparking has a synopsis on the US House of Reps crypto meeting</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13fbc6v/daily_general_discussion_may_12_2023/jju7s0y/)

##Summary/Highlight of US House of Reps session: Future of Digital Assets. 

Pleasantly surprised by most of what was discussed. Almost all the guest speakers had excellent ideas and explanations in the discussion. However, each person was allocated only 5 min at a time, so it was somewhat limiting. Please excuse me if some of this is a little raw. It is a 3 hr meeting and I don't have the time atm to format it correctly due to my excessive fiat mining op (work).

**Intros of Committee and Guest Speakers:**

Mr Johnson: Must be a bipartisan effort for a promising tech/market. Conflict between securities and commodities laws. Most of the G20 countries are ahead of us. We want to be the leader in this tech/industry.


Ms Caraveo: Digital asset activity grows, but so does non-compliance. Any legislation requires increased funding of CFTC.


Mr Hill: Can this industry thrive here in the US? Many Democrats calling for common sense legislation for months (not just a partisan issue). Can't trust offshore exchanges (FTX), so we need to work on laws here for US exchanges.¬†


Mr McHenry: We want a collab of CFTC and SEC to make laws and close regulatory gaps to protect consumers.


**Guest speakers**


Durgee: I'm the only non-attorney here. Already there are conflicting laws against other existing laws for crypto from the SEC and CFTC. This is a developing tech innovation that happens to be a digital currency as well. Adoption at this stage is not a tech problem, it's a human conditioning issue. A 13 year old in their lifetime has grown up with BTC and only known a world with crypto in their life.


Mr Santori: Kraken is well established in the US and the world. Europe has more effective rules from tested principles unlike the US. Gaps in US have created litigation that doesn't protect consumers. Mandates needed to protect us: <https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?t=43m21s>


Mr Massad: Confusion about commodity/security classification of crypto worsens the gap problem. How can we apply Howey test without this info? We need to pass a compliance law directing CFTC and SEC (or SRO; self regulating agency) to create laws and enforce them, without rewriting commodities and securities laws. Regardless of your stance on crypto we need this framework to protect consumers.


Mr Blaugrand: If investors could have traded digital assets on an exchange that was regulated like the NY Stock exchange, FTX situation wouldn't have happened. We can use the established rules we already have and apply it to crypto with these 4 rules: <https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?t=58m34s>

Mr Steil (WI): We still have no path forward for regulation, even after Gensler's meeting with Congress. Congress is ready to do the job. How do we not miss out vs overseas? W/Shoenberger: Switzerland made it very clear to define security/commodities. It gave them legal security and clarity that allowed them to proceed successfully. This framework that they provided certainly provided the legal certainty to be headquartered there and to have legal clarity around the classification instantly. W/Durgee: The rest of the world has more stability and growth in every avenue of crypto. 3x as much investments vs the US in some markets.

Mr Lucas: US is great because we embrace innovatio. w/Santori: G20 markets are ahead of us and are sophisticated. Kraken is expanding there, but we can't deploy the same resources here in the US due to these regulatory gaps. Lucas: what SEC rules need altering for exchanges to succeed? W/Blaugrand: SEC needs an onramp with regulation so exchanges can grow in the US. They don't because of regulatory vagueness. W/Satori: Flexibility of crypto is a perk. Broker/dealer construct can interact directly with consumers. We could limit exchanges and even close down exchanges after hours.

**The negative:**

Lynch (Mass): Not regulatory ambiguity; it's mass non compliance with existing laws. Don't argue security vs commodities, we should instead focus on intermediaries (exchanges, lenders, and wallet users). SEC is clear, consistent, efficient, and prevails in every 140 cases. crypto industry has failed. No separate regulatory regime necessary for crypto. claimed that creating new legislation for digital assets seems ‚Äúredundant and unnecessary‚Äù given that the financial system‚Äôs current securities laws have ‚Äúsustained massive innovation in our financial system for decades."

Mr Casten: What return would I had if I invested in 12 cryptos during a time vs S&P (60% profit)? Loss 46% of investment, how is this a supposed way to close wealth inequality gap? W/Durgee: accredited vs credited access is important. Mr Casten: I'm happy to debate truth not lies. Everything stated here beginning to sound like SBF and FTX, what's the distinction? Sounds like you want to regulate crypto with the least funded organization.

Mr Sherman: Buttcoin mod? An ignorant person's lack of ability to learn anything new. Fossil garbage opinion. Uses term "crypto bro". questioned whether digital assets should even have a future in the United States. He referred to cryptocurrencies as a ‚Äúhidden money system that diverts capital investment from useful industries, and whose announced purpose is to defeat sanctions and tax laws. 
Crypto bros make money literally by making money, and they‚Äôve made over a trillion dollars. They‚Äôll accuse the U.S. government of making money out of thin air. Maybe we do, but we‚Äôre the U.S. government."


**Threaten Web3 Anonymity:**

Mr Davidson (Chairman Housing subcommittee): Gensler's hotel California's regulation provides no path to exit/leave. Who should have the power of exit from intermediaries (power to have self custody)? w/Santori: Who is best placed to collect KYC info? Kraken is well paced to do that and doesn't require KYC for every transaction, but we could do that if required.

Dr Foster (IL): Estimates of 95% trades are fake or wash trades in derivatives. How can we have a regulated futures market with this fraud and manipulation? What alternative to KYC at all levels is there to avoid fraud? W/Satori: Kraken provides this as a portal. Foster: we can't stop BTC on the dark web with that. At a wallet level we must have mandatory monitoring with licensing like automobiles. Trusted digital identity from the government. W/Kulkin: CFTC had auth it could conduct surveillance under the rules and jurisdiction of the exchange thereby acting as an SRO in addition to the CFTC/NFA. 

**Conclusion** 

McHenry: Even if there is nothing of value in crypto, you would still need enforceable rights and protections already found in regulations and laws in the US.  Must come together in bipartisan manner to protect investors. 

5 days for additional legislation questions and responses granted from the panel. Plans for another hearing this month made. 

Last month, McHenry said he expects that the President will have signed some piece of crypto legislation into law within the next 12 months.

<summary>u/T0Bii starts a discussion about different client pairs and the finality issues</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13g7s03/daily_general_discussion_may_13_2023/jjzailv/)

Anyone else here whose validators had no problems during the finality issues?   

What clients are you running?  

What are your hardware specs?  

I missed an average of 1 attestation per validator that day and my inclusion distance was around 0-1 as well. I'm running Nethermind/Nimbus.   

But I saw a big increase in CPU and bandwidth use, between 2 and 3x of the usual average, spikes even higher.  

That's not a problem for my staking machine, but if others had similar spikes, I can totally see why many had issues.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade comments on the communication between EVMavericks and EthFinance and u/juxtanotherposition shares some notes from EVMavericks oDAO meeting</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13h32x6/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2023/jk3rlbf/)

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

Respectful criticism:

I'm a bit disappointed to see that despite the idea of the the ManeNet DAO joining Rocket Pool's oDAO having emerged from r/ethfinance and having received [great support](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jijszul/?context=3) from r/ethfinance, all of the conversation has now moved over to [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/963992696387694592/1104380534253158470).

I realize that this is a very specific topic and most of the conversation shouldn't happen in r/ethfinance. But it would still be great to discuss ideas in this sub too when needed, and keep the entire community informed of the latest news.

For example, did you know that there's a proposal being drafted that has been in the making for a week? Or that a dedicated meeting happened on Friday?

Like many others I don't like Discord, I find it messy and a pain to follow so I don't use it. Maybe I'm just too old for the "chat" format.

Would it be possible for one of you Discord guys to keep us informed in here from time to time? I'm sure many here would love to be kept in the loop and even contribute.

r/ethfinance gave birth to the ManeNet DAO after all, and all EVMavericks were Ethfinancers before becoming lions.

In the spirit of sharing more from EVM Discord to r/ethfinance and about the example [that brought it up](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13h32x6/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2023/jk3rlbf/), I shared my notes from the 1st Discord Call about the oDAO on Discord, but haven't shared them here yet:

>I was taking notes for myself and I've put that into Pastebin (unlisted) ([https://pastebin.com/nrmwEyGg](https://pastebin.com/nrmwEyGg)). I'm sure there are lots of errors, incomplete thoughts, and typos.

Also, I tend to ignore Discord except for something I'm very interested in (like the oDAO). So I sympathize with the comment poster. As an EVM holder, I'm loyal to the dailies, but not the Discord. So I miss some EVM things when they don't make it back here. h/t u/Ethical-trade

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13hy6ue/daily_general_discussion_may_15_2023/jk7f7vc/)

So while I was gone and there was all that drama with the beacon chain, my Teku node got caught up in it and fatally crashed and was completely offline.

However.... I run a second Ethereum "stack" with Lighthouse as the consensus client, which the validator process switched over to and was able to carry on with no downtime like nothing even happened.

I was able to recover the Teku node in my own time, and once it was back in sync the validator process automatically switched back over to it as the primary endpoint.

Client diversity is awesome!

<summary>u/maninthecryptosuit explains the big Ledger drama</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ivi8v/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2023/jkc5s70/)

Just found this confirmation:

[Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca confirms the seed phrase leaves the device (may only be applicable to Nano X.)](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/-/jkbyyfp)

> The device sends encrypted shards of your seed to different companies if you decide to use the service. You can of course still choose to backup it yourself.

[But 2 days ago the same co-founder said:](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13gs0xn/-/jk34kcn)

> Your keys are always stored on your device and never leave it

That's what Ledger has been claiming for years as well. 

**If we assume the chap wasn't lying 2 days ago, that means the new firmware ( [one screenshot shows 2.2.1 for Nano X](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13iocfk/so_even_if_i_dont_use_this_service_my_ledger_nano/) ) that just rolled out activates the backdoor "ability" to extract the seed.** 

More info: [Wired article](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ftx-crypto-investors-hardware-wallets) says:

>Ledger is preparing to launch a new service called Ledger Recover that splits a wallet recovery phrase‚Äîbasically, a human-readable form of the private key‚Äîinto three encrypted shards and distributes them to three custodians: Ledger, crypto custody firm Coincover, and code escrow company EscrowTech.¬† If somebody loses their recovery phrase, two of the three shards can be combined‚Äîpending an ID check‚Äîto regain access to the locked funds. Essentially, Ledger Recover is an additional safety net; for the price of $9.99 a month, it takes the jeopardy out of crypto‚Äôs version of stuffing dollars under the mattress. It‚Äôll be available in the UK, EU, US, and Canada and come to other territories later in the year.

[Ledger CEO Tweeted it out as well. ](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1653463160370675730)

Why this is an issue - even if Ledger now cancels their new seed cloud backup service (because backlash), and says they will never make a firmware update use this hitherto unannounced "ability", the mere presence of this backdoor means that bad actors/governments may be interested in it. I guess this is what we get for trusting a company that kept its software closed-source.

My next steps:

- Immediately stop using Ledger Live
- No more firmware updates
- Hope and pray that my ancient Nano S devices didn't have this backdoor

With ledger (potentially) going full retard again, I'm updating myself on what hardware wallets are available in the market right now. Looking forward to if anyone has other suggestions, additions or corrections to my high-level assessments below.

I've been using this list for discovery (trying to narrow down the list of 387 wallets): https://walletscrutiny.com/?verdict=reproducible&platform=hardware 

There is an insane amount of options in the market, but very few can fit these requirements;

-	open source everything, including firmware and hardware
-	uses a secure enclave for cryptography (extremely hard to get the private key material out of the device, [apparently controversial given their closed nature](https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-tropic-square-why-transparency-matters-a895dab12dd3))
-	has a display that shows information about what you're signing (the bigger the better)
-	At the very least supports both EVM chains and bitcoin-type chains (bonus for other chains and other curves, e.g. edwards)
-	reproducible firmware builds, i.e. you can tell that the firmware blob matches the published code

I've discarded a bunch of products (e.g. ngrave) that have little to no information about their device or the software that runs on it. 

What I've found that (superficially) gets closest to the requirements (in no particular order);

#### trezor

- I have tried the trezor one, but the hardware died a few years ago
- open source [firmware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware), [hardware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-hardware)
- does not use a secure enclave
- reproducible builds
- has a display that shows information about what you're signing
- been around for ages so its been battle-tested (plenty of fixed side-channels issues etc) and its weaknesses are somewhat well understood (limited physical security etc)
- works with BTC/EVM/Cryptonote chains and others

#### keystone

-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone-se-firmware)
-	open source [hardware](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/Keystone-developer-hub/tree/main/hardware)
-	large display
-	secure element
-	unclear if builds are reproducible
-	supports btc/evm chains and a ton of other more oddball stuff like cardano, tezos etc
-	never heard of it before today, no idea how battle-tested it is

#### cypherock 

- never tried
- open source [firmware](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware)
- open source hardware
- no display!
- uses secure enclave (smart cards)
- reproducible builds
- pretty new, haven't seen anyone take it apart/try to break it yet

#### Bitbox02

-	never tried
-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware)
-	open source [hardware](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware#hardware-docs)
-	small display, displays some information about what you're signing
-	uses secure enclave AFAICT (ATECC608B)
-	reproducible builds
-	supports btc/evm chains
-	been around for a while, has had a few vulnerabilities (e.g. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18673)

#### keepkey

-	never tried
-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware), hardware
-	reproducible builds(?)
-	small display showing information about what you're signing
-	trezor clone?
-	supports BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE (and a few more similar coins)
-	been around a long time, has had multiple vulnerabilities (e.g. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30330)


#### Grid+ Lattice1 (closed source)

- **closed source firmware, hardware**
- I have one of these, the UX is OK, but the device itself is huge
- large display, detailed transaction information including native smart contract support (when ABI is available)
- tamper-resistant
- uses secure enclave (in device, and smart cards)
- no reproducible builds as its closed source
- pretty new, haven't seen anyone take it apart/try to break it yet, but the described design seems sensible

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi discusses DAO delegation and reminds us of our duties!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13jryjf/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2023/jkhzazl/)

To those who own governance tokens / participate in governance, you should check out Tally's [governance-week](https://delegationweek.com/). They are coordinating with a bunch of DAOs to encourage people to delegate or periodically revisit your delegated tokens. A great place for ethfinancers to start is looking at [https://dailydoots.com/#delegates](https://dailydoots.com/#delegates) to find out who on this forum is a delegate. 

The HOP bridge protocol is one of the partners and will be providing some funds from the grant pool to support Tally on this project. The exact details on how they will incentivize is not finalized yet - initial discussions where subsiding gas fees, but looks like it might be shifting to a distribution to those who participate ([the forum discussion is here](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11)). Either way, I'm happy to see HOP providing support!

That all said, whatever governance token you own please consider usings this week as a chance to re-visit your delegated tokens. It's an important step for the health of a DAO, as set it and forget delegating can stagnate a DAO's leadership and create a barrier to entry for new delegates to join in. And if you are looking to become a delegate this may be a great opportunity to jump in!

If you've ever visited EthStaker's website before, you'll have seen that it was... largely unnavigable. Well - we wanted to build a new, open source one, so we put out a call on r/ethstaker to see if we could find someone from the community, familiar with staking, to help us do it. [u/hanniabu](https://reddit.com/u/hanniabu) is awesome and did it!

So now EthStaker has [a new open source website](https://ethstaker.cc)!! Feedback would be most appreciated, especially from ethfinanciers. What would help you find the info you want about staking? I didn't love giving people discord and subreddit links when they asked for resources, so I'm pretty stoked to be able to give them a website where everything is aggregated.

I'm also gonna post a series of 'beginner guide to staking' blog posts over the next couple weeks (at https://ethstaker.cc/blog), would REALLY love feedback on that from someone who *sorta* knows what staking is but wants to know more. Mostly for readability

<summary>u/696_eth discusses a new entrant in the decentralised liquid staking game</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/131i3ej/daily_general_discussion_april_28_2023/ji2w589/)

I looked into DIVA and wrote [a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/696_eth/status/1651804749245870081) about them yesterday.

Here's a quick summary for Ethfinance:

* Diva is a decentralized way of staking
* **Di**stributed **Va**lidation staking thru Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). Trustless. Resilient. Secure. Cause of fully distributed network of validators. Entrance as low as 1E.
* Liquid staking. You would stake to get divETH, which operates kinda like stETH. You can wrap into wdivETH which operates like rETH/wstETH. This can be tax advantageous depending on your preference of incoming vs capital gains.
* You would have an option to run a node for extra rewards (split 50% between stakers and node runners in the final Phase 2 version on the mainnet). There's some minimum hardware requirements. 
* It's currently on the testnet. Should be live on mainnet in Q2

The key points is that I've learned is that combines liquid staking with DVT. Since it uses a smart contract to pool funds it can be as low as 1E. Honestly, I'm waiting for a bit more info after their testnet releases to see how it pricesly protects against penalties and bad actors and why 1E would be safe. Also, not enough info on Node Operators and right now you would not be able to run one on the testnet. 

Side note. SWISE vaults might be in a similar vein I guess.

[Diva's site](https://divalabs.org/)

[An extra useful article](https://divalabs.medium.com/how-diva-is-designing-a-more-trustless-staking-solution-acc96ca5a549)

Please correct me if I misunderstood something or if you wanna educate me more, this was a new concept for me so it was a bit hard wrapping my head around it when figuring out how diva is planning to make it work not just in a theoretical way.

It's the 1920s, you're starting to see these fancy new self-propelled horseless carriages or "cars" pop up everywhere. They look really cool but they're also quite dangerous. This is what the kerfuffle is about in the congress at the moment. Everyone knows that we need to protect people from the maniacs on the road. But astute observers also realise that we also need to protect the innovation and economic advantage these new-fangled machines provide.

Lawmakers are split on what to do. Representative Emmer thinks we need new laws. "Rules of the road" for all to comply with. Rules which all road users must follow specifically designed to create order out of the chaos on the road while still allowing for fast, efficient travel. But senator Warren disagrees. She thinks these new machines should be treated like horses under the ancient 1839 "Horse and Carriage act". She doesn't care that horses are slow, living creatures which need to eat, sleep and poop while cars are fast, furious and can run all day. She insists that these roads were built for horses and that makes anything on those roads a horse, dammit!

Don't be like senator Warren.

**Edit:** If anyone with some clout on Twitter wants to screenshot this and run with it, go for it. Or if you reckon you can take the idea and shorten it down to the Twitter character limit, that would be impressive so go for it.

The fact that it is invite only is despicable and counter to any ethos regarding decentralization.

[u/Datacruncha](https://reddit.com/u/Datacruncha):

Ethereum's consensus layer and execution layer currently don't talk to each other so you need oracles for something like rocket pool. The odao does all the oracle work for rocket pool and upgrades the smart contracts. They can technically collude and cause massive damage so the best way to prevent this is to overpay and only include trusted people. Yes, the work is fairly easy and not worth half a million a year and everyone wants a spot. Thankfully, a lot of the money goes to fund client teams which helps ethereum run and keeps it decentralized. 4 spots are allocated to the rocket pool team to help fund development. Sassal donates all his earnings. 

Eventually, there will be less of a need for the odao with upgrades to Ethereum like eip 4788. If anyone has any  technical or economic suggestions about the odao they can post in the rocket pool forum or the research section on discord. Please note, it takes very little effort to criticize and substantial amounts of time and coordinated effort to come up with working solutions.

<summary>u/MerkleChainsaw is looking for real adoption and u/silentjxhn makes a great list of examples</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/134d3x2/daily_general_discussion_may_1_2023/jigbkxt/)

[u/MerkleChainsaw](https://reddit.com/u/MerkleChainsaw):

Long term, I'm very positive that Ethereum will eventually dominate the crypto space and that it will address most major technical challenges, even if it takes another decade or two. I'm pessimistic about crypto overall though.

I'm still on the sidelines because I'm having trouble seeing how crypto overall will achieve *true adoption* anytime soon. I define "true adoption" very narrowly as significant demand for ETH to be used for some external purpose other than crypto speculation or facilitating crypto speculation. So for example providing DEX liquidity, staking/validation, and issuing most tokens or NFTs don't count since the demand is mostly based on putting fiat into crypto hoping to get more fiat out. Things that do count include airline or concert ticket NFTs, using ETH contracts for supply chain tracking or audit, and so on. In these cases someone is willing to buy ETH because they can use it to solve an actual problem. I think most other successful technologies were solving real world problems by this stage in their development.

Where can this adoption come from? After all the scams, fraud, and hacks I'd have trouble convincing any company board to use public blockchains beyond maybe an NFT cash grab offering, if for no better reason than avoiding the reputation risk and liability from using crypto. Even a simple use case like accepting stablecoins as payment is tough because every major stablecoin has depegged at some point.

Though it's small, I think EVMavericks is an example of true adoption. Demand for most people is based on "I'd like to be a member of a club" rather than "I'd like to sell this JPG for a profit". Maybe some Reddit avatars count in this category as well?

Is there anything on the horizon that I'm missing? Financially I want to buy ETH because it has an asymmetric distribution of returns, and I believe Ethereum is one of the only projects in crypto being designed with good intentions and a long term focus. On the other hand I'm increasingly having trouble seeing where enough new demand will come from to justify a $220B valuation.

<summary>u/benido2030 has a monthly staking update</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jikbng0/)

Here's your new monthly staking update: 

**Validator overview - total: 619346 validators\***

* 554322 active
* 18350 pending
* 7333 exiting
* 39341 exited

**Client diversity numbers\*\***

* Consensus: Prysm 38% // Lighthouse 37% // Teku 17% // Nimbus 6% // Lodestar 1%
* Execution: Geth 64% // Nethermind 16% // Erigon 11% // Besu 8%

**Pool distribution\*\*\***

* Unknown 41,8%
* lido 23,3%
* Coinbase 9,6%
* Binance 3,7%
* Kraken 3,5%
* Rocket Pool 2,7%
* \+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc. 

My goal is to show how things develop and answer questions like "How many validators will secure the network by EOY if net new validators are constant", "Is client diversity improving" and "How is the dynamic between centralized pools and decentralized stakers". 

If you think something very important is missing, let me know and I'll add it today or tomorrow, so we can work with it in June. Best case share your source, so I know where to find the stats. 

This post will contain more information and probably some conclusions in the future, I hope this will be a good summary and help for those who don't check numbers regularly (I basically didn't do it and could not tell you how things are developing right now)

**Some comments and sources:**

All percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.

P.S. I wanted to do this yesterday, cause it was the first of the month, but I had no time cause of the bank holiday and also I was too stupid yesterday... So let's pretend today's numbers are those from May 1st.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade has a cool idea for EVMavericks</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jijszul/)

Here's an idea: EVMavericks' ManeNet DAO becoming a Rocket Pool oDAO member.

Aren't we an ideal and trustworthy partner that highly values decentralization?

Edit: just realized how unwelcoming this post must feel to any new member. So let's explain a few things for our most recent friends: 

A while back r/ethfinance launched its own NFT collection, [EVMavericks](https://opensea.io/collection/evmavericks) and used the occasion to launch a DAO, the ManeNet DAO. From [its website](https://dao.evmavericks.xyz/): *"ManeNet DAO advances the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education"*

[Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) is a liquid staking protocol, and the oDAO is *"the group of special Rocket Pool nodes that are responsible for the administrative duties required by the protocol that cannot be achieved by Smart Contracts due to technical limitations".* The "o" in oDAO stands for "oracle".

So basically the idea here is to have an r/ethfinance native DAO help Rocket Pool with some of its duties. This job pays rather well, and the money could, according to the ManeNet DAO's mission, be used to advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/136avsi/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2023/jipex7f/)

Yesterday, u/Ethical-trade made a post about how the EVmavricks should join Rocket Pool's oDAO. I loved that post so much, I covered it in today's Rocket Fuel - making the case that I strongly support them joining. 

I support ManeNet DAO joining the oDAO so strongly that, in the episode, I made the offer of lending the DAO the 1750 RPL needed to cover the bond if they are selected. 

Also, I wore my EVMavricks t-shirt especially for this episode!

Meanwhile, in NFT-land...

Blur, the incumbent NFT marketplace, just [announced Blend](https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1653101755809562624): a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platform that lets users leverage their NFTs as collateral to borrow ETH. These loans are perpetual (no expiration price or date), at fixed rate. The twist? Lenders can call the loan at any time, triggering a Dutch auction for a new lender to step in and take over the loan.

But wait, there's more! Blend also [announced a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) feature](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/ZieWXcPU3Td_8Ipozx9hw0atASKyjY7WlF1mZiANf0w), enabling users to "buy" their favourite NFTs with just a 20% down payment, while the rest is borrowed from a lending pool. I wrote "buy", because until the price is paid in full, the user can't do anything with the NFT, except for listing it in Blur's marketplace (ie try to sell it back and profit from the move).

As always, with great financialization comes even greater risks. Borrowing ETH to "buy" an NFT (BNPL) means going long on leverage (you profit if the price of the NFT rises). Borrowing an NFT and immediately sell it for ETH (Blend) means leveraging short (you profit if price falls). The result: when NFT values fluctuate in the opposite of the "expected" direction, users will quickly face liquidations.

We will soon see the impact of this development on collection prices. While leverage markets can help stabilise price fluctuations, they can also create massive liquidation cascades, so I'd expect some days of wild rides are ahead.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12uv9kn/daily_general_discussion_april_22_2023/jhatugd/)

As I mentioned in the previous day it was 1 year in NFTs for me a few days ago and I'm taking that opportunity to reflect on the last year (& maybe a bit more) and on a variety of topics and experiences. I'm also going to repost them here and maybe something resonates here and there. Of course, I'm starting it with Ethfinance!

[1 Year in NFTs: Ethfinance](https://imgur.com/z2jXfi4)

I start my reflecting on 1 Year in NFTs from Ethfinance.

r/Ethfinance - subreddit that has influenced my Ethereum journey greatly, and thus - my NFT journey. 

But how is it exactly connected?

I've heard more and more about Ethereum as some of my online internet friends started exploring other chains besides bitcoin. Ethereum was one of the most promising ones. Eventually I ended up hearing more and more about it and I thought it was time to start looking into it. I do not remember exactly how but I did find r/ethfinance sometime in the middle of 2020. 

The discussion was amazing compared to the r/ bitcoinmarket's daily that I had been frequenting for years. Not only people were talking about the tech, it was the majority of the talk there. Quite a contrast compared to only 'number go up' in the btc daily.

Fast forward to March 2022, there's now talks about this NFT project - EVMavericks. Most active people where whitelisted. I had not. Why? Even though I'd been quite a frequent visitor - I was a lurker. Luckily, I made a few comments over the few years and that was enough to get on an additional list and then winning a raffle solidified my involvement. 

Nowadays I still visit the Ethfinance daily, almost on a daily basis. Sometimes I get too busy with life. It's still a wonderful place to ask questions, hear about new developments, be alerted about important topics, see the stories of community members and learn something new everyday.

After being one of the most active members in the EVMavericks discord and being still quite a strong lurker and even turning into a slight poster on Ethfinance, I can share a few of my observations. 

I personally prefer the pace of the discord as it's more of a live chat and closer to a real time conversation. Ethfinance has a higher quality and lower noise. Yet it doesn't do one thing very well for me and I'd bet especially for the people who are lurking - involving you in being part of the community. You see, sometimes folks like me who are new and not technical have really nothing substantial to contribute. And even though some of us are still asking some questions from time to time which I believe are still valuable contributions, it just does not complete the puzzle. And I believe each of us has something to offer and we can learn something new from each other. And this is where discord comes in and that is what it allows you to do, and I feel that EVMavericks degen chat, in particular, is prime example of bringing folks together. It's a glue. Still maybe for some but not others. 

Now I'm not going to go into pros and cons of each platform but one more thing I will mention is that the subreddit is a nice free resource for new folks. And I feel the vibe is especially geared for people who are, hopefully, going to make it financially as well as being the ones who are understanding and embracing many aspects of the technology and tools that we discover and build. 

Next up: reflecting on EVMavericks.

[1 Year in NFTs: Twitter Followers (4/21/2022-present)](https://imgur.com/Ulr1FWP)

I never really cared about Twitter prior to this point. I created an IRL account like 10ish years ago but never really used it. When it comes to crypto, most of my time was spent on Reddit - r/ethfinance.

Now, I'm not sure why I created this account, but it seems to be a day after I minted my Maverick. I know there's usually lots of excitement during the early days (the honey moon phase), and people were eager to bond together and roar about the lion pride. Anyway, I ended up creating an account and following all the Mavs the EVMavericks account was following. One thing that was still weird to me is that so many web3 or crypto projects use Twitter, which is a full web2 platform that can and has rugged some of my friends' accounts before. My account has been locked multiple times for no reason until you add your phone number, etc. to unlock it. One click on their end - you are gone.

Over time, and after getting more into ENS, I started caring more. I've changed sides of caring and not caring so many times now that I don't remember all the details, but I do know the important parts. What I've come to and what I hold nowadays is that I am able to hold both of the sides of caring and not caring at the same time. I personally don't care about it at all. When I'm in nature, when I'm doing things outside, when I'm engaged in the things that matter, and so on and on and on.

The nuance comes in because part of me does care. It does care for a very noble, specific set of reasons too. In the world where I do have more followers, I would be able to spread my values, educational messages, and even some funny memes to a wider range of people. All of that is nice, and yet it's important to let go of all of that. Otherwise, it alters my behavior in a way where it's still geared a bit more towards getting better numbers, while still keeping my true values. But then I wonder, and I like challenging myself with the question, "Why does a number of followers impact the content?".

"If I am doing something good, wouldn't it matter whether one or a thousand people see that?"

Again, there are, at least, two sides to the coin that I'm holding. And at the end of the day, I'm still human, and it does get very demoralizing to see all the people doing scammy (all other types of things) having more followers and more impact, which I judge as a net negative.

And why am I building in the first place?

I thought having a personal blog is nice addition that is like a journal, a resume, and basically an on-chain history of your identity. It seems we are not there in crypto, so that's why I'm still using Twitter, as it does matter, but also playing around more with web3 projects like mirror.xyz and paragraph.xyz. Also, building on top of ENS, even something as simple as a site - 696.eth.limo, is a way of doing that.

Honestly, there's still so much more to write about followers and how I have figured out some particular nuances, but, again, it doesn't really matter to me at the end of the day.

Although I'd say I have tried to be consistent on a daily basis for almost a year, maybe missing a bit in the beginning, and have contributed content in a variety of forms, including memes, threads, questions, observations, analysis, videos, news, step-by-step guides, etc and I have gotten to 2275 followers. That's also including all my NFT related communities and ENS.

I'd like to end it on a note that's future-focused. What am I going to do going forward?

Obviously, I don't have enough reach, and that's also a good thing for me mentally, as it gives me so much more room to experiment and make mistakes.

The most important to me is to be true to my values and certain things like curiosity, decentralization, community, collaboration, communication, transparency, education, and making people smile and laugh. All of that while being authentic, having a better balance on how this piece fits within my life puzzle. Focusing on my connections with people and on the effort that I'm putting in, and the content I'm creating than [being a slave to the algorithm.](https://imgur.com/dggpWLe)

<summary>u/Ethical-trade reviews RocketPool's Atlas upgrade in the days since it went live</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12vwbun/comment/jhdmsg3/)

Here's a Rocket Pool update since Atlas / LEB8 went live.

The minipool (RP's validator) count went up from shy of 14,000 to 15,329 today. Since 16eth pools can be divided into 2 leb8 pools, total count goes up, not much of a surprise here. Roughly +10% in 5 days.

More interestingly, node count went up as well from 2,291 to 2,393 which is a clear uptick that can be seen in [this chart](https://rocketscan.io/nodes). More nodes is what we decentralization maxis should be all about (and what I'm all about), so this is absolutely great news. According to [Etherscan's node count](https://etherscan.io/nodetracker), there are currently 9,170 Ethereum nodes.

**Rocket Pool now accounts for more than 1/4 of all Ethereum nodes. With a market share of only 2.7% of validators.**

I haven't found any reliable chart updated with Atlas but from my observation of the total number of eth staked from the [official website](https://rocketpool.net/#header), there's been roughly 3,000 eth poured into RP daily since the update. That's $5 million per day.

Before Atlas, the deposit pool was continuously full (meaning reth was highly in demand, never available) causing [a premium on the price](https://dune.com/mellamopablo/reth-premium). Today it's the opposite, there are many minipools waiting so the deposit pool is close to empty. In other words, many node operators are waiting for people to swap to reth. The premium is almost gone.

There are currently [21,870 reth worth $43 million waiting to be picked](https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake).

I'm expecting some whales to swallow a lot soon, and secretly hoping for Vitalik to swap some eth for reth. Would be crazy publicity for RP. Next time he does an AMA I'd like to ask him what he dislikes the most about Rocket Pool, I'm very curious to know his opinion.

In other great news, Rocket Pool's reth is now more profitable than Lido's steth, making it [the default option to stake from Metamask](https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake).

Rocket Pool is currently ranked [\#11 by TVL on Ethereum](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum) with a TVL of $1.37B and it looks like it will enter the top 10 in a few days.

I've probably missed some key data and would love to hear more!

Disclosure: Rocket Pool enthusiast here, rpl is my second largest holding after eth and approximately 25% of my total net worth.

<summary>u/nikola_j explains an interesting tidbit about EOAs and smart wallets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12vwbun/daily_general_discussion_april_23_2023/jher94h/)

Hey, mate, one of the defi saver team members here.

Not sure which protocol you're considering using there specifically - is it Aave?

If yes, then that means that a position created on a smart wallet using defi saver would not be visible or manageable in the default frontend available att app. aave. com.

Why is that? Well, interacting with all these different protocols directly through an EOA (your standard Ethereum account) is the default approach in most cases (e.g. Aave, Compound, Liquity). This is mostly for simplicity reasons and gas savings.

However, a standard Ethereum account is currently limited in terms of how many smart contract interactions can be called within a single transaction.

This is why we chose to use the smart wallet as default for holding positions of each protocol we integrate at defi saver.

Main reason? The smart wallet provides a new layer of execution that has no limitations that a standard Ethereum account does. That's why we have options such as 1-tx leveraging/deleveraging, collateral and debt swaps, 1-tx moving of active positions between supported protocols, as well as a number of automation options for all protocols.

This short article in our knowledge base has a brief intro to the smart wallet: [https://help.defisaver.com/en/general/what-is-the-smart-wallet](https://help.defisaver.com/en/general/what-is-the-smart-wallet) 

If there's anything else I can clarify, please do let me know, would be glad to help.

**tl;dr:** If you open an (e.g.) Aave position on a smart wallet using defi saver, it won't be accessible through their frontend at aave. com. All exactly same protocol rules and rates apply in both cases, but their frontend only supports positions sitting on EOAs.

I finally took the trouble to switch my wallets over to AGQR in the wake of the mysterious wave of wallet drainings that Twitter has been [abuzz](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568) about.

**How do AGQR signers work?**

1. Similar to dedicated hardware wallets, you create a new seed on the signer device itself. (You can also import an existing seed.) You store a backup of the seed you created in the same way you usually would/should: always by writing it down, never by printing/screenshotting.
2. Your private key is held on the signer device--in my case I'm using an old Android phone running the free, open source Airgap.it Vault software. (I know, it might sound risky to keep your private key on a phone, but if you're cautious enough not to trust airplane mode, you could physically shield, remove, or otherwise disable the wifi, bluetooth, and cellular radios.)
3. On a separate, networked device (PC/laptop/tablet/other phone), wallet software such as Metamask suggests a transaction in the way we're familiar with, but when you click "Accept", instead of signing the transaction itself, it displays a QR code containing the parameters of the transaction.
4. You scan this code using your AGQR signer device, and then authorize signing on the device itself, using whatever security features the device has--PIN number, pattern drawing, fingerprint, etc. Again this is similar to dedicated hardware wallets, but here there is no physical connection between the two devices. (Hence the term "air-gapped"... which is probably a rather old security term, and makes less sense now that wireless networking is pervasive, but I digress.)
5. After you authorize, your AGQR device signs the transaction data and displays it on-screen in the form of a QR code.
6. You then hold the screen of the AGQR device up to a webcam attached to the networked device that first suggested the transaction, and it reads the QR code and broadcasts the signed transaction to the Ethereum network.

It might sound like a hassle but the whole process takes about one minute when you get used to it.

**Why not just use a hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, Lattice, etc?**

1. Owning a hardware wallet makes it obvious that you're into crypto. For those of us who would rather keep it discrete, an old phone wins hands down. The hw wallet companies seem to really disregard this segment of the market. Case in point, the new "fashion" Ledger wallets that you wear on a chain around your neck. Thanks but no thanks.
2. Personal information exposure risk. Buying a hardware wallet potentially creates a record of your name/address/phone number/credit card number being associated with cryptocurrency. This could be no big deal, or it could be a huge deal in the case of the Ledger customer data leak. Buying a phone creates no such risk. In fact...
3. You probably already own an old phone. If not you can buy one cheaper than you can a hw wallet.
4. Phones are mass-produced consumer technology. We could argue that hardware wallets have become this too, but which is easier to quickly replace, repair, or troubleshoot? Definitely the phone, in my opinion.
5. No custom firmware/drivers. It seems like every few weeks there are new headaches and incompatibilities based on faulty or late firmware/drivers.

**Downsides?**

1. Since it's just (free) software that runs on a phone, it doesn't create any revenue for the people that make it. Therefore if there are future changes to Ethereum's transaction data format, updates to the AGQR signer software could be slow or even, worst-case, non-existent. However, the software I'm using is open source, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem for long, if at all.
2. For the same reason, the supported range of phones might not be the best. The software installed on my old Galaxy S6, but wouldn't launch properly. 
3. For the same reason, customer service/support might also be bare-bones or non-existent. I haven't checked yet.
4. Not many people are using it, as far as I know, so you won't be able to Google for answers as easily. But hopefully as awareness of how effective this tech is, this situation will change! Indeed, that's part of the reason I'm posting this.

**Summary and Conclusion**

I'm aware I'm maybe honeymooning over it, but I'm strongly tempted to say the AGQR signer is "the way": it has basically all the benefits of a hardware wallet and basically none of the drawbacks. It's portable, small, and self-contained, without notifying everyone that you're into crypto, and if it breaks, no big deal, you can get a new one the next day.

Trying to think about it more objectively, I know some people are likely to feel that AGQR on an old phone is a bit too "DIY" to trust their money with it. That's understandable, but on the other hand, I figure a lot of us here already have a pretty DIY attitude if we're willing to hold our own keys in the first place.

In conclusion, I think there will always be a market for dedicated hardware wallets, as a "no compromises" type, maximum security, industrial-grade solution. However, for most of us, I think AGQR fits the needs of the user so much better that it's not even close. Especially if you tend to think things should be open source and self-hosted, you owe it to yourself to explore this tech.

TLDR: I'm loving my AGQR setup and just wanted to let everyone here know about it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12x3uzq/daily_general_discussion_april_24_2023/jhhxhlh/)

Here is a proposed public good that I think we could bootstrap through this community or EVMavericks.

A curated white-list of trust-worthy smart contract addresses. Plus a browser extension that relies on it and lets you know whenever you are interacting with a smart contract that it's a know and trustworthy one and warns you when it's an unknown one.

In the future this whitelist could hopefully be integrated in other wallets, MetaMask, frame.sh, etc...

Thoughts and criticisms welcomed!

[u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy):

It feels so good to have fully minted out Withdrowls and start the public goods funding buidlathon!  It makes me so happy to see community come together to support a great cause!

Some fun facts about Withdrowls: it was 4 days from idea to mint out. Marketing started the day after we decided this was something we wanted to do, so only 48 hours of marketing before mint. It also only took 24 hours to mint out! Oh, and about 95% of the tweets were automated, that was a lot of fun.

We jammed A LOT into those 4 days so please give [u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider) a hug next time you see them, and please sign up; all ideas are welcome :)

Feel free to hijack this comment's replies if you don't have an idea, but would like to team up with a community member!

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard talks more on human coordination</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12z6zsm/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2023/jhr4hui/)

I've written before about crypto and [Human Coordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination/) and why it is my favorite leg of The Rabbit Hole. A lot of the work to date on this topic is on deciding relative balances of power between key actors via token distributions, identifying all the necessary actors of a system and ensuring they are fairly compensated and cannot profit from misbehavior (incentive alignment), and creating systems to encourage voter participation such as delegation and bribe systems. There is an implicit step before all of that wherein an organization needs to agree on what it is trying to achieve and critically *how* it should go about achieving it. This is the value alignment process, it is a never-ending affair, and it's a predecessor to all other actions of an organization.

Once upon a time in MakerDAO, after a black swan event wiped out many of their early users, the DAO was faced with a decision on whether to reimburse those affected. They decided not to. They then had to decide what was more important between peg stability and decentralization. They chose peg stability and created the Peg Stability Module (PSM). To this day I still disagree with both of those decisions but regardless of how I feel the DAO had to wrestle with controversial values, reach a consensus, and then act. How to enshrine values into a system varies greatly by each system but I think it's worth reviewing some of the methods we've seen so far, what is good and bad about them, and how we might be able to improve upon them.

Some systems are able to enshrine their values in code. For example Ethereum, when forced to tackle the [scalability trilemma](https://chainstack.com/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma-scaling-solutions-for-ethereum/), chose decentralization and security over scalability. These values are encoded in the gas market and block sizes. Solana went the other path. Earlier in its history Ethereum was forced to choose between finality and ethics (look up Ethereum Classic). We chose ethics. Judging by the relative adoption of Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic this was apparently the more widely supported choice by a majority of node owners, app developers, and companies. Behind these decisions is what we commonly call Layer 0. This is one of the most fragile parts of the Ethereum ecosystem and one that we have to maintain constant vigilance on. The value alignment process for Ethereum can basically be described as a vacuum where a process should be. How does one become part of the Layer 0 set of actors? Basically you post in Ethfinance, attend events like Hodlercon, meet/influence the right people, attend core dev calls, write ERCs, etc. You go down The Rabbit Hole and get *involved*.

In more traditional power structures where value alignment decides the strategy of something but not necessarily its implementation it is more normal for the value alignment process to take place by delegation and hierarchical decomposition. It is infeasible to coordinate an organization the size of a nation state using an open mic system or social media upvotes. So we tackle this complexity using walled gardens and hierarchies. Within a corporation the primary organization of this hierarchy is what I refer to as the [pyramid of subordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TradiCorporateStructure.png). This structure prevents bystander syndrome by assigning accountability for each task, ensures each person is qualified for the job using a social attestation system in the local vicinity of the pyramid (interviews), and generally organizes people to act towards a unified goal. It is efficient when done well. The military uses a similar structure for the same reasons. It also doubles as a more efficient value alignment system than I've seen in DAOs. When there is disagreement this structure provides an escalation process amongst direct reports, peers, and superiors within the pyramid of subordination. If a matter isn't satisfactorily resolved by those initially involved, it escalates up to the C-level personnel who serve as the ultimate authority for the values of the organization. By the time it reaches them, there are almost certainly multiple valid strategies that could be taken that they are deciding between. This is actually the primary value of C-level personnel; they embody the values of an organization.

So what are the problems with this design? What are we hoping to improve with web3 technologies? Well, the problem begins just above the pyramid of subordination. As we‚Äôve seen in the US in the past 50 years, using highly liquid capital as the ultimate authority source in the system has led to the pursuit of short-term profits at the detriment of all other factors. Shareholders care about their share price and dividends above all other factors and so they appoint C-level personnel and structure their compensation to reflect this desire. As a result companies destroy the environment, have little to no regard for their employees well-being, subjugate their local communities, pursue one merger and acquisition after another in order to form too-big-to-fail monopolies, and exploit every financial and political system they can to stifle competition and create power imbalances in their favor. From a game theory perspective this is the expected outcome of this design. It is Moloch in action, as our society increasingly organizes itself into these ever growing capital-hungry behemoths. You would think companies would be beholden to customers but the customer has no influence in this power structure other than to take business elsewhere. Sadly, working to stifle competition and reduce customer choice is often more effective for companies than working to improve the customer experience or provide a better product. So, the first thing to improve is to create structures for value alignment that are able to embody a wider diversity of values without sacrificing organizational efficiency.

The second thing to improve is resilience. This structure is fallible to key-man syndrome. It is optimized for efficiency not resilience. When one person has the full autonomy to do something it becomes ripe for corruption and/or enforcement pressures. The larger the set of people that need to consent to something the harder it becomes to form a conspiracy to make any decision that does not align with the DAO consensus mission.

If we can only succeed at improving these two facets of organizations, crypto would already be a world-altering, indispensable technology. But we are working on so much more than that. We are working on ways to divorce capital from influence, remove the walled garden around the value alignment system, fight any and all forms of coordination failures, and novel ways of incentive alignment that can change human behavior at scale so that our societal values more closely align with those of our dominant power structures. It is basically impossible to be against this ethically once you understand it. The most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood.

<summary>u/Hocilef shares an underrated protocol</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12z6zsm/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2023/jhrphbf/)

I have came across an interesting protocol called Sismo enabling users to manage their various digital indentities privately using zk-badges.

As hinted, it uses zero-knowledge proofs. If you are not familiar with these, this video shared multiple times in the daily was very helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c). Basically, it is a mathematical tool allowing to selectively reveal a piece of data. Applying these to digital identity, you can aggregate valuable characteristics from different account (web2) or ethereum wallet without revealing their adresses. 

For instance, let say you have a wallet with which you gave a lot to Gitcoin grant and another one with a high degen score. You want to aggregate theses characteristics in a third without giving your history (adresses). Sismo allows you to do this. Practically, you connect your different wallets to their apps, create signatures and mint "zk-badges". A badge is a non-transferable/soulbound token (NT-ERC1155).

From their docs (https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/):

> Users aggregate their identity in Sismo‚Äôs Data Vault and start accumulating Data Gems‚Äîatomic pieces of data that categorize users into groups. In turn, users can generate proofs to make claims about their data (e.g, I own a specific NFT). These proofs are verified by applications‚Äîeither on-chain or off-chain. The resulting privacy-preserving attestations‚Äîstored in on-chain smart contracts or off-chain databases‚Äîare utilized by applications for access control and reputation curation.Users aggregate their identity in Sismo‚Äôs Data Vault and start accumulating Data Gems‚Äîatomic pieces of data that categorize users into groups.

If you have participated in Gitcoin Round 15, you can mint a ZK-badge curated by their team!

<summary>u/nixorokish celebrates u/Benjamin Chodroff's great work to save over 2000 compromised validators</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12kcm3z/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2023/jg5ex6s/)

Dunno if anyone's mentioned this yet, but CLWP (EIP-4736) included 2,133 potentially or definitely compromised validators who were racing to set their withdrawal address before a hacker could.

Of those 2133 in the set, 2133 were able to set their address to one controlled by the rightful owner. 100% success rate. *Not a single one* to a hacker.

Benjamin Chodroff (and Jim McDonald, I shouldn't have omitted that) was the author and did a seriously amazing job after realizing that his own seed for his validators were compromised and, instead of giving up and leaving the space, found a way to save not just his own, but thousands of others. Seriously amazing job.

<summary>u/domotheus and u/geoffbezos discuss EIP-4844/Danksharding</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzwpos/)

[u/domotheus](https://reddit.com/u/domotheus):

Imagine you go to the Apples and Oranges Store because you need some oranges. But the store owner is quirky and has a rule that goes "This store will only sell 1000 total items per day. Whether that's 1 apple and 999 oranges, or 900 apples and 100 oranges, or a perfect split I don't care. Once I sold my 1000th item I'm done for the day."

Also, this store's apples are very good. People drive from all over the place to buy them. So naturally since supply is low and demand is high, so the cost of apples go up and the store owner makes a killing selling them. Oranges, on the other hand, aren't as popular. On average, the store owner sells about 980 apples and 20 oranges every day.

You personally don't really care that much about the apples, you want to buy oranges. But due to the store's weird rule, you still have to outbid people looking to buy to buy apples. Oranges should be cheap because they are plentiful and in low demand, but every orange you buy is an apple someone else can't buy. After the store sold 999 items that day, why would he sell you an orange for $1 when someone's willing to buy an apple for $10? You'll have to offer at least $10 to get the orange you want.

"This is really dumb", you think to yourself. You talk to the store owner and make him come to his senses, and he agrees to change his stupid rule. Now he'll sell at most 1000 apples per day *and* at most 100 oranges per day. So now that the two supply/demand markets are separated, an apple can cost $10 and the orange can cost $1 and everybody's happy - you get cheap oranges, and the store owner gets more money (1000 x $10 + 200 x $1 gets him more money than the previous system when $10 was the cost of an *item* and he sold 1000)

Back in Ethereum land the apple represent *execution* (the gas that affects state, compute stuff in the EVM, etc.) and oranges represent *data* (the gas that stores stuff in the chain's history). Rollups do their execution off-chain, so what they need most from Layer 1 is data. Today the cheapest solution is using call data at 16 gas per byte. But if everyone's fighting to do EVM stuff, the cost of that 16 gas/bytes goes up as well because there's only so much gas in each block. This really shouldn't be the case, since data is a different resource from execution.

So what EIP4844 does is separate those two resources into two distinct markets: The gas market as we know it today stays the same, and there's a new "data gas" resource with its own pricing that happens separately. Rollups will be happy because now they get to commit their batches on chain in these nifty new things called "blobs", and when demand for blobs is low, blobs will be cheap ¬≠‚Äî even if there's a huge NFT drop going on that brings gas to 500 gwei

On a technical level it does other cool things in preparation for full danksharding later on, which will allow a significant increase in the size of blobs so that it becomes even cheaper for rollups to commit data to blobs. But even without danksharding, just splitting the markets will help drastically lower fees on rollups, which will be nice.

[Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzrdc2/) I asked about how EIP 4844 aka proto-danksharding works.

I got some really good answers so decided to sum it up, I put together a [thread](https://twitter.com/0xjaypeg/status/1646550326965862400) with an ELI5 on how danksharding works. TL;DR for those that don't want to click into twitter:

- ETH txns vary across "complexity" (complexity measures gas)
- Txn "complexity" is split between "execution" vs. "data"
- Currently "execution" and "data" are sold via the same gas market
- Danksharding splits up these up so there's a "data gas" market
- "Data gas" market sells "data" via "blobs"
- L2s benefit since the txns they post to mainnet have a lot of "data" complexity 
- The implication is that L2 txn costs won't be as impacted by ETH mainnet activity (big NFT mint, airdrop claim event)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12lkn8x/daily_general_discussion_april_14_2023/jg7my5f/)

Meanwhile, in post-Shapella NFT-land..

The whole point of crypto is trustlessness and code-is-law. As a consequence, NFTs are immutable.

Well, it turns out that sometimes they are not.

Truth Labs, the org behind Goblintown profile picture NFTs, suddenly changed the jpegs of their all NFT collections to a.. middle finger with more middle fingers, with the text: "Fuck royalties. Fuck supporting builders and creatives. Flipping is the heart of what makes web3 special. Honor the flipper, fuck the community. Long live the slow rug!" [Check for yourselves](https://opensea.io/collection/goblintownwtf). 

This move is part of their migration to new contracts, probably to enforce royalties on-chain. As you know, the Blur vs OpenSea feud caused a race to the bottom on "off-chain" royalties.

Truth Labs still had access to the contracts able to change the metadata of their NFT collections, effectively giving them the power to change the jpeg that the NFT represents. This took many holders by surprise, since they thought their NFTs were immutable.. Well now they need to trust that Truth Labs will change their jpegs back.

There is a lesson to be learned here. Even if a web3 participant understands the underlying technology, and the principles of trustlessness and immutability on which crypto is founded, they still can be caught in a trap. Smart contracts are law, but sometimes this law is not what we think it is.

[u/ProductDude](https://reddit.com/u/ProductDude):

Any legal people care to give an opinion on what todays ruling means for the SEC? 

* Supreme Court Endorses Streamlined Challenges to Agency Power

[u/Dont_Waver](https://reddit.com/u/Dont_Waver):

It means that if someone is being charged by the SEC, and that person claims that the SEC is acting unconstitutionally, that person doesn't have to wait until the SEC is done with the enforcement action to appeal in court.

Administrative groups, such as the SEC, are part of the executive branch of the government, but they have a sort of judicial power in enforcing the regulations that they were formed to enforce. So previously, you would have to wait until they were done with their investigation and enforcement action before you could appeal to a court. However, if you are arguing that the SEC doesn't have constitutional authority to enforce whatever it is they're trying to do to you, it's kind of silly to have to wait for them to finish the whole investigation and enforcement action before you can object and appeal.

For the SEC, this means that if, for example, Coinbase was charged in an enforcement action by the SEC and Coinbase wanted to argue that the SEC doesn't have the power to regulate crypto under their grant of power, it could immediately appeal to a federal or state court and have this argument ruled on. This would save a ton of time and money if the court finds that the SEC doesn't have that power.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12mqnlc/daily_general_discussion_april_15_2023/jgfzula/)

So there's this idea I've been wanting to try for a while now.

You guys know how Ethernodes is notoriously bad at showing how many actual execution nodes there are? And so we don't have any real sense of how many there might be? I even see some discussion farther down the daily today on that subject.

I think we here in EthFinance/EthStaker might be uniquely well-placed to answer that question: how many nodes *are* there on Ethereum? Basically, a bunch of us who run nodes (including execution clients) would go and look up our node by IP address or public key on ethernodes.org. Then we'd each just reply to the comment/thread/whatever with a simple "yes" or "no", depending on whether Ethernodes knew about our node.

With a big enough sample size, like dozens or ideally a few hundred+, we'd start to get a pretty clear picture of how many actual nodes there are out there.

Example: Ethernodes claims there are 7500 nodes on a particular day. When 100 of us check our nodes that day, only 25% show up on Ethernodes. Conclusion: There are actually 30k nodes, give or take some error bar that I'm sure the stats majors here could figure out (i.e. not me :P )

Thoughts?

<summary>u/BuyETHorDAI discusses an anti-crypto podcast which reminds us that the most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jghox4h/)

Anyone watch Bill Maher? One his guests wrote an anti-crypto book, and I just found the arguments in their interview funny.  I think the interview just furthers my view that Ethereum needs to dissasociate itself from the word cryptocurrency. I would much rather see the word cryptonetwork as it conveys that currency is not a central theme. But anyways I summarized the interview because I think this is a great summary of the mainstream opinion on "crypto".

- Cryptocurrencies aren't currencies and never will be (defined as store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account)
- Centralized exchanges should be regulated like banks
- If money is trust, then the term trustless money is nonsense. It's like saying a government-less government, or religion-less religion. 
- cryptocurrencies are not money, they are investments for higher returns which makes them a security
- The only people that use them are crminals and gamblers because its inherently a zero-sum game because cryptocurrencies don't do anything. Usually a security is a share of a stock, but with crypto there's no product, there's no good, or service, which is why it's a zero sum game where for someone to win, someone has to lose
- Crypto is a ponzi scheme because a million people can't access their money out of FTX
- If you lose your "pin number" in crypto, then you're just fucked and there's nothing you can do which is why people use exchanges so that someone else is reponsible for your shit
- Most centralized exchanges are fake and eventually collapse
- NFTs are a ponzi scam / right click save / jpgs / wash trading / goodluck selling your bored ape
- The amount of energy for "blockchains" is ridiculous. In 2021, Bitcoin and "other cryptocurrencies" mined a ton of energy.

These are almost verbatim the arguments thrown around. The first thing I notice is that if you replace the word cryptocurrency with Bitcoin, it makes a lot more sense. The arguments are very surface level and lack a ton of nuance because in the maintreams eyes, cryptocurrencies are all like Bitcoin. I think the old saying around here absolutely applies. The most bullish thing about Ethereum is to be understood.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jgjy13h/)

Now that withdrawals are enabled with the successful upgrade of Shapella, I'm keeping an eye out for institutions and big movers. 

Already this year we've seen [Fidelity and Blackrock](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/21/14-trillion-earthquake-fidelity-and-blackrock-are-quietly-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-next-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-bull-run/?sh=41e77f2a6759) pouring funds into Blockchain. 

NASDAQ in their [Digital Assets Business is expected](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-eyeing-q2-2023-release-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-custody-platform) to start providing customer crypto custody by the end of June after receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. Much like Fidelity, the platform will function similar to an exchange with liquidity and execution services. 

Just last year [Bank of America reported](https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2022/10/bank-of-america-private-bank-study-finds-younger-investors-turni.html) a turning signal for wealthy investors away from the stock market and into Crypto, Real Estate, and Private Equity.

>"75% of young investors say it‚Äôs impossible to achieve above-average returns solely with traditional stocks and bonds."

Combine this sentiment with the economic slowdown and credit crisis, crypto investments are in better position this year.

Also, and not the news I expected to see gain traction and excitement, but the Bank of America is reporting some interesting drivers of recent digital asset adoption from gold:

[Tokenized gold](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/16/bank-of-america-reveals-surprise-crypto-key-driver-amid-300-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana-price-boom/?sh=35b657842956) passed $1 billion in value last month under the market cap pump of stablecoins PAXG and tether gold XAUT. 

> "Tokenized gold provides exposure to physical gold, 24/7 real-time settlement, no management fees and no storage or insurance costs. The low minimum investment increases accessibility and fractionalization enables the transfer of physical gold ownership and value that was not previously possible."

We could all do with some peace of mind and stability after all the black swans we've experienced last year. Here's to hoping that these large institutions don't exert regulatory and market forces in the wrong direction and fuck it up for the rest of us.

<summary>u/Jin366 digs up something from YouTube covering AI and Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12p2uhe/daily_general_discussion_april_17_2023/jglfue6/)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3DP-40TA4&t=2380s>

This is a gem of a channel. He talks about autonomous AI and how Ethereum might play an important role in the future AI economy. Really good. 

This is the part where he speaks about AI economy (and Ethereum):

"Now, I will discuss the integration of these AI models into the legacy financial system and Ethereum. These models can function as a central brain and connect to other neural networks, AI systems, and handcrafted intelligence systems like Wolfram Alpha. As the AI assistant interacts with apps and handles tasks for you, there will be a need for it to manage money.

In the first iteration, AI will interact with apps to book flights, for example, and users will confirm and approve transactions. As the AI becomes more effective and trusted, users will want it to handle more tasks autonomously, including financial transactions.

There will be pressure to integrate AI into financial systems, but this may create friction in the traditional financial system. These autonomous AI entities might face difficulties meeting regulatory expectations because the legacy system is governed by regulations designed for humans. Additionally, the traditional financial system is not well-suited for global transactions between AI agents due to regional differences.

Crypto systems like Ethereum, on the other hand, are well-suited for autonomous systems. Ethereum was designed with the idea that autonomous agents might conduct much of the financial activity in the future. It is permissionless, global, transparent, and digital-native, making it an ideal platform for AI agents to manage accounts and interact with smart contracts.

Though most economic activity still occurs in the traditional financial system, friction in that system may push AI agents towards crypto systems like Ethereum. Smart contracts on Ethereum can be used to coordinate AI agents, creating a seamless environment for AI-driven financial transactions."

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12qb6uw/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2023/jgrgc6o/)

Patrick McHenry did a FANTASTIC job with Gensler today. I believe he really forced the issue on Ethereum as a Commodity and hope it leads to regulatory movement (but maybe we in the U.S. shouldn't hold our collective breaths just yet with our painfully slow government, sigh). Anyway, g*reat job Rep McHenry!*

But damn, also McHenry (and I'll keep this REALLY brief): **votes against** Women's Health Protection, the Chips Act, the Infrustructure & Jobs Act, multiple bills protecting Queer rights, multiple bills protecting the right to vote, multiple bills to (can we please!) close assault weapon loopholes...

\*Okay, back to Ethereum. And yes I'm flying my 'Murica flag here today, so bare with us everyone around the globe :)

I've been thinking a lot about how Ethereum can be represented better in U.S. legislative process. Reps like McHenry & Emmer are (let me be mild here) faux "public servants." They have clear records of working against the Common Good. **Ethereum deserves better heroes.** I don't consider myself politically savvy and work in an unrelated field but am wondering what effective avenues would be worth my time and/or support. I have donated to Coincenter in the past and probably will again, ~~but I need to update myself on what they have been up to.~~ *Edited:* [*Coin Center works to educate policy makers.*](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) *Recent efforts to educate involved the terrible "Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act," the "RESTRICT Act," and the Treasury's DeFi risk assessment. I hope to find out more about specific advocacy they are doing.*

Any other coalitions come to mind I need to become aware of? Any ideas perculating on effective organizing or lobbying for those of us who care about good ETH regulation? I would love to donate some time and energy to this, but not sure at this juncture what will make a difference.

P.S. Just so you know I'm not on some Lib high horse, I can't stand listening to Senator Warren talk either \*facepalm. Thanks for reading...

<summary>u/RevolutionarySoil11 has some wallet tips for everyone</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12qb6uw/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2023/jgqarxi/)

For anyone worried, here are some wallet tips:

1. Keep your funds seperated if you have a lot of money. There have been plenty of cases of people accidentally signing fraudulent transactions even with a hardware wallet, because their PC was compromised. So don't mix your 100 Eth retirement money with your wallet containing dickbutt NFTs. Also if you interact with dodgy or untested contracts, use a seperate wallet for that too. 
1. For best security use a multisig wallet/social recovery or a hardware wallet
1. Wallet ‚â† wallet. Do your research, the more funds you have the more careful you should choose the wallet. They're all developed by different teams with different philosophies
1. No, HW wallets are not unhackable as some seem to think. There can be and have been plenty of bugs found in the code. The same goes for any wallet. There is no perfect security, know the risks. 
1. Revoke permissions!
1. Hackers aside, another maybe even more common way ppl lose funds is by their own error. Make sure you have the keys/recovery phrase properly backed up. There are a lot of different ways you could do that, spend some time reading up on it. Never upload it to any online machine or expose it to a camera connected to the internet. No cloud storage, no smartphone etc. Your private key must never get close to the internet! Obviously physical theft can also be a concern, although lesser. There are ways to greatly mitigate the risks of self custody, look into it.
1. If you're relatively new to all of this Andreas Antonopoulos has some great videos on wallet security etc. on Youtube. He mostly talks about Bitcoin but it's same same for beginners. It's important to know the basics.

Here's a draft letter to the president/legislators/lawmakers from the perspective of a web3 developer. \*One\* sentence was generated via ChatGPT, the rest are my own words (my letter will be different, as I am not a dev tho I do feel like this effects my career too). Feel free to use and customize. Apologies but I'm super tired and barely proofread it.

> Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  
>  
> I‚Äôm writing today because I am concerned about the lack of clear regulation in the blockchain and web3 industry. For many developers in the space, this technology is our pride and livelihood. Most of us recognize that the space has an overabundance of scams and theft. There is a clear distinction between private companies like FTX who offer a product with no transparency and a public ledger built on open source technology.  
>  
>  
>  
> Blockchains offer a lot more than just being an immutable ledger. Web3 has the potential to transform many aspects of our society, including finance, governance, and data ownership. The United States should be a leader in innovation and adoption of impactful technologies. As someone who grew up in the nineties, it is the closest thing that reminds me of my childhood during the early days of the internet, when America chose to be a leader in household adoption of a technology that advanced communication beyond what we would have ever imagined a century ago.  
>  
>  
>  
> Although our industry has a lot of problems, there have been some great achievements from development teams and good faith actors in the space. Last year, ethereum had a groundbreaking upgrade that reduced network energy consumption by almost a hundred percent by upgrading to proof of stake and eliminating the need for wasteful crypto mining. Hacked funds are often traced by the community with updates on activities broadcasted through social media and it‚Äôs quite common for the community to help its users get stolen funds back. There have also been millions of dollars donated in aid to Ukraine through cryptocurrency.  
>  
>  
>  
> The web3 and blockchain space, as known as the ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù industry, have grown a lot since the inception of bitcoin. Today there are many communities in web3 that make up the collective space and if you were to navigate through them you would find there are many who are excited about this technology. Many of us have put a lot of time, passion, and hard work into the development of this tech and it‚Äôs a big part of our lives.  
>  
>  
>  
> Some of us feel that CEOs of private companies shouldn‚Äôt be the only representatives of our interests as a growing industry. We are also disappointed by the actions of SEC chairman Mr. Gensler and his hostility to American companies like Coinbase, who actually have gone above and beyond in regulatory compliance. Furthermore, the draft bill of the RESTRICT Act contains alarming implications for the privacy and speech of American citizens.  
>  
>  
>  
> We hope that our political leaders could do some more community outreach in the space so we can properly educate our legislators about the technology. We especially urge regulatory clarity for developers, stakers, and everyday users. We understand that there shouldn‚Äôt be rushed legislation to integrate blockchain and crypto assets into our existing financial infrastructure. We just want to do our jobs as software developers and home stakers, who work hard and invest our time and money into developing a revolutionary technology.

<summary>u/asdafari12 reminds us that we aren't against regulation itself</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12rhig4/daily_general_discussion_april_19_2023/jgwy2on/)

Reading many ppl here the last days that claim we are just greedy and only care about pumping our bags. **We aren't against regulation, we are against bad regulation.** If the SEC got its way, I predict that ETH would be a security that retail can't touch directly, only indirectly from various bank products. Private stable coins might be banned. Private wallets, or what they call them - unhosted wallets, wild wallets or dark wallets will be banned. Defi itself likely banned unless accessed from a bank that charges a fee, "for our protection".  

No other country is stuck on the question, whether ETH is a security or commodity. Crypto regulation in the UK and EU is not perfect but we realize that crypto is here to stay and put out regulation, guidelines and not just 55 litigations. I was positively surprised by how many Defi actions, my Nordic tax authority has provided guidelines on this year. ETH staking (cap. gains, not ordinary income), lending, LPing etc. Meanwhile, the US IRS hasn't even spoken about ETH staking. Most people will likely class it as ordinary income because that is safer than to classify as the lower taxed capital gains. 

SEC's actions are embarrassing (even Hester, Gensler's colleague says so), the IRS is embarrassing, the political dick swinging between agencies, embarrassing. R vs D as well and things like that make me lose faith in society and the democratic process more than any crypto scammer ever did. Scammers do it for the money, above, I think is done for the same or even worse reasons.

I deposited my ETH into the staking contract 871 days ago. Later, on 1 Dec 2020, Beacon Chain launched, and since then my solo staking rig has been running 24/7 with near perfect uptime. Total downtime amounts to probably less than half an hour. I've earned a nice amount in consensus and execution rewards.  Operationally it has cost me nearly nothing, about ¬£100-150 in electricity over the 2 or so years, and about 12 hours of my time. It runs in a fanless case, so I don't even hear it. I sometimes forget it even exists. It contributes to the Ethereum network and is a source of passive income that has truly no intrusion in my life. And yet, I can't wait to instantaneously exit all of my validators and dump all of my ETH later tonight.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12d9ndu/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2023/jf7hy4w/)

Hello ethfam,

I'm going to try not to drag this out. Those of you that know little bits of my life from what I've shared here know that I first entered the ethereum space at the beginning of covid. I was supposed to fly from Ireland to the Philippines to finally marry my long term girlfriend of 13 years when covid put a two year halt on it. For those two years I saved like a motherfucker and invested hard into eth and its ecosystem. Initially with a percentage of money that was for a wedding, then ramping up the DCAs more and more over time.

Last May I celebrated my marriage in the Philippines here with all of you. It was a long time in the making.

Three months ago, after a long and arduous (and expensive + paper heavy) process, my wife and I managed to secure a spousal visa for her to come live with me.

And that brings us to about an hour ago - after three days of literally no sleep I've secured a property here for us. I'm not exaggerating when I say in this timeframe none of this would have been remotely possible without this subreddit. Ethfinance is the flame that keeps my passion burning. A massive thanks to Arbitrum for that ridiculous airdrop also. 

I'm proud to say that, thanks to this space, I will be flying out once more to the other side of the world next month for my 1 year anniversary, but this time my wife is finally coming back with me, with my surname, a secured visa and her name on a frankly beautiful and much too big property.

Thank you everyone. It's the next chapter for me. Now I can finally start planning for solo staking.

Keep 'er lit,

<summary> u/696_eth introduces us to the ENS NameWrapper</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12eagbz/daily_general_discussion_april_7_2023/jfaaq5b/)

ENS NameWrapper that has been in works for years is going to be activated soon (within 24ish), [the vote has passed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42973781582803845389836855775840822719678533376883030929209752909248937768242) and there is a 2 day time lock.

There's so much untapped potential in it so I'm very excited. And there's already many cool apps that are building on top or utilizing ENS, maybe I'll write about them later, big part of them are still in beta phases or are relatively new and small.

But the one cool thing I wanted to share that might be really useful to you now is this:

so you can create a subdomain aka child, so let's say using mine as an example, *evmaverick*.696.eth

but what might not be intuitive is that you can create a subdomain of that subdomain!

and that's how we get - *337*.evmaverick.696.eth (for context, 337 is my token ID of the lion)

and so on and on - ü¶Å.337.evmaverick.696.eth

Now you can just pick a domain (5 char+ for $5/y) and create subdomains for your vaults, your burner, hot and all other wallets while not paying any extra additional money since subdomains can be free, you only gotta renew your parent, which is 696.eth in my example. Of course, there's so much more options going to be available now cause of fuses (that's a big topic in itself).

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12g9dz5/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2023/jfjkmym/)

Same thing I told the other sub:

**Don't rely on revokes**

It's good to check your revokes regularly using revoke.cash, but you shouldn't be relying on them.

The SushiSwap hack is one of those cases where a hardware wallet wouldn't have saved you, and revoking would've been too late.

**Using Minimum allowance is the Best Practice**

The best practice is to approve ONLY the exact amount of tokens you needed to make a swap so that once your swap is complete, the allowance automatically goes back down to 0.

* For example, if you approve 300 tokens and swap 250 tokens, your allowance for a particular spender goes down from 300 to 50 tokens after the swap
* So if you approve of 300 tokens and swap exactly 300 tokens, the allowance goes down to 0 and that router can't spend anymore.

I know it sucks to make a new approvals on L1 Ethereum where gas fees are expensive. But on cheaper networks, you really have no excuse.

Fortunately, many newer tokens allow permits instead of revokes, which combines an approval and transfer into 1 transaction.

Sad to see that the thing I warned people about 6 months ago finally happened.

After RCPSwap and SushiSwap first launched, I noticed that 99% of users were setting **unlimited approvals** and warned the community about it.

Back then, there were no front-end revoke tools for Arbitrum Nova like revoke.cash, and Metamask's approval UI was less transparent, so [I wrote a guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMoons/comments/xzn3gj/how_to_revoke_unlimited_approval_on_arbitrum_nova/) on how revoke manually using the Moons contract.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard talked crypto with the family at Easter</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12h7qgo/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2023/jfnvog9/)

I was talking with some family friends today for Easter brunch and, being polite, they asked me about some crypto topics. I ended up explaining the basics of lending in crypto which I'm going to paraphrase here. This is probably one of those things everyone here already knows but which might be useful if you ever need to explain this to someone outside this space.

There are three ways we facilitate lending in crypto today:

1) Overcollateralization. You post collateral worth more than what you're borrowing. In Tradfi this is basically the structure of every mortgage/car loan. You use the property you are buying as collateral for the mortgage itself. This works best for assets that are unlikely to sharply depreciate in value and put lenders underwater. In Defi, that property obviously doesn't hold so we add self-liquidating mechanisms to this system. If your collateral ever falls in value relative to your loan you forfeit the collateral to repay the debt automatically. We mostly use these loans for financial speculation or retaining price exposure to an asset while effectively selling some of it. 

2) Flash Loans. We let you borrow as much money as you want on the condition that you have to repay it instantly. I find this is the most confusing one to people at face value but it makes sense to most people when explained in terms of originating mortgages. Again, mortgages are overcollateralized loans. Without flashloans there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem where without the loan you can't buy the property and without the property you can't get the loan. In Tradfi they have an intermediary facilitate this by effectively granting you a short term loan. In Defi, that's just involving an unnecessary middleman so we dispense with it.

3) Leverage. You can use 1 ETH to buy 3 ETH and exaggerated effects as the price goes up and down. This is similar to overcollateralized lending except we don't actually *give you* the 3 ETH. It's held in escrow by some contract so you can't run away with it. In the example above if your collateral falls by 1/3 in value you get margin called and liquidated. This is really no different than how it works on traditional brokerages. The main difference with Defi is while things like naked shorting are *illegal* in Tradfi brokerages, they are *impossible* in Defi.

That leads us to the last form of debt most people know: uncollateralized lending based on credit. While there are some teams experimenting with this, we just can't bootstrap these systems effectively until we solve the problem of accountability. IRL it is both difficult and illegal to set up multiple identities. On blockchains it is trivial and there is no such thing as the police. If I am willing to give an anonymous stranger $10 on credit I at least need to know that if they rug me they can only do that *once*. That at least means I can only get rugged 7 billion times. Identity theft and fraud are already a problem in Tradfi. In Defi, the problem is so much worse that what you take for granted with a credit card today can't even get started. We may see a Tradfi equivalent to credit systems on a blockchain once a government decides to build a system to certify an identity on chain and integrate their legal system with smart contracts for enforcement but we'd really like to see a more decentralized approach.

There are numerous advantages to eventually solving this problem on the blockchain. For people with existing access to credit, a technology called zero knowledge proofs adds privacy protection so Experion doesn't repeatedly leak your personal data to identity thieves. Next, is consumer choice: the market would be free to create a much wider array of credit score services rather than the regulatory captured monopolies we have today. Last, ironically is scalability; not in transaction throughput but in customers. Right now credit services are available to a minority of people, mostly in first world countries. If this becomes solved in Defi in a decentralized way it can be scaled to all of humanity rather than the limited countries credit services exist in today. This is where a company like Visa will actively get involved eventually because it is a Trillion dollar opportunity that will let them expand their user base.

These systems won't take root in Defi until we have a good system for proving an address belongs to someone and that they singularly claim that address for these credit systems. Once we have that we'll see a variety of credit score DAOs appear in short order. They will essentially act like competing underwriters but unlike Tradfi the performance of each will be public and every app will be free to choose whose opinion they respect and pay for.

I'm also still curious about [alternative credit systems](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty).

[u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy):

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider) and the EVMavs have done it again! We're creating another project similar to EIPandas to celebrate the Shapella hardfork! There are 3240 owls from 20 powlyments minting on Arbitrum for 0.00324 ETH, or 0.0019 ETH for the allOWList [https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls](https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls) We plan to hold a virtual mint party using oncyber so we can show off the artwork gallery style. The mint button will even be embedded into the virtual room!

Proceeds will fund the next EVMaverick public goods project. I know there's someone out there with an idea here that deserves funding!

We had a lot of fun using the beta of AutoMinter's new AI Art Generator for this collection! I had so much fun making this project that I'm raffling away 5 of my EIPandas to those who can use their referral link to get 5 friends onto the list!

And of course, thank you so much to the ethfinance community. I gravitated here when I was new to crypto because of the high level discussion. I "earned" my Maverick asking questions here knowing I could always get an informative response. I probably would have lost all my money to shitcoins without this subreddit, but thanks to y'all I'm staking and having the time of my life making AI owls.

As [u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy) mentioned we are excited to celebrate Shapellowl with you!

To commemorate we've created "Withdrowls!" 

They are intended to be fun, punny, celebratory NFTs for the community, AND as a special treat MANY members of our communities (ethfinanciers, daily dooters & EVM's) will have their own personalized punny owl name in the metadata to be "their own withdrowl" as a special little sentiment to commemorate the momentous occasion. 

Bob-Rowlssi, swagtimusprowl, owlexiskef anyone??  :P [u/Bob-Rossi](https://reddit.com/u/Bob-Rossi), [u/alexiskef](https://reddit.com/u/alexiskef) , [u/swagtimusprime](https://reddit.com/u/swagtimusprime)

ALL funds (100% of mint & royalties) from the Withdrowls will go towards funding the NEXT public goods project after rocketschool anyone in our community wants to create! 

We thought this would be a great way to incentivize people that have an idea to start building and to get people excited and involved in creating public goods/doing something new AND get funded for it!

Check out the Allowl list for additional details! Mint will be .0019 for allowlist and .00324 for public and will be on arbitrum for low fees!

Looking forward to all the Shapellowl celebrations! Will definitely be a hoot ;)

<summary>u/Ethical-trade talks about Ultra Sound things</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12i920r/daily_general_discussion_april_11_2023/jft3t1h/)

Just stumbled upon [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xqyt74/comment/iqdxblk/) I made a few months ago in here: 

*"Any day could end up being the day there's been the most eth in existence ever."*

Happened to be posted less than 10 days from the peak on October 8.

Ether's supply has been going down since October 8. 

Checking [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) has become part of my daily routine even though no new information is really to be expected, I just find it soothing to look at, to marvel at. The Ethereum community has really created something never seen before: a system with a security that's economically self sufficient. 

I truly regret that the mainstream understanding of inflation is "price of things goes up" instead of what it truly is: "value of fiat goes down". This simple switch in mental model would be incredibly useful for the masses to realize some of the biggest and inherent problems with the current system. 

And at the same time, it would be incredibly useful to understand what's so special with eth.

It's been 208 days since the merge and there's been a net burn of more than 82,000 eth. During a bear market (or well, an eternal crab, hail). Total supply is now 120,438,242 eth, and it's clear we'll end up below 120,000,000 sooner or later. 

Since the merge deflation has been accelerating. But what will this look like during a bull market? When usage, euphoria, and greed go parabolic? When the supply is inversely proportional to the mania? 

Witnessing the supply chart take a vertical dive will be absolutely glorious for sure.

We'll soon visit the abyss.

This it how the Euler exploiter saga ends.

When the exploit happened a month ago, I would not have expected that we'd reach this step, all the funds I deployed there I've written off. The Euler saga is a unique story, full of drama and in my case a happy end. 

Those who deployed via a smart contract (e.g. aztec users) need some more patience as those affected users can't claim directly.

Happy Shapella Day and stay safe out there, fellow Ethfinancers!

Woah, did someone just exploit a vulnerability in the ERC-20 standard itself???!!! I am seeing a cascade of the largest ERC-20s like USDT and LINK getting all funds sent to 0x36c9aFAkE324b‚Ä¶. On etherscan.

Meanwhile other ERC-20s like DAI and USDC have frozen transfers in response. I‚Äôm impressed with their reaction times to be honest.

What sort of impact could this have on other EVM based blockchains like BNB? It seems like it will be a scramble for ethical exploiters to take funds before actual hackers do.

Anyway, no doubt April is wasting no time in showing how chaotic things can get on the 1st!

<summary>u/0xdefiant introduces himself to the sub and shares his project idea!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jefgnli/)

gm r/ethfinance, I had the chance to talk with u/jtnichol yesterday, pretty outstanding guy. He told me to intro myself here and share an idea I have.

My name is Anthony Garrett‚Äî I‚Äôm a college student at Gonzaga and I started [Bankless Advisor](https://www.banklessadvisor.com/) in the Bankless DAO, a platform to connect financial advisors and clients, but we're in need of a pivot-- the idea I have is an app.My vision for a BA app is to create a web3 directory for users to send trade proposals to each other. Each account is a web3 wallet for users to trade and comment on other trades. Our market fit would start with the Bankless community and college students ([SPAWN](https://www.spawn.global/)).However, my long-term vision for the BA app: We allow users to import their data from other social media networks to their web3 wallet and build smart contracts that pool users data to connect ad buyers to users.

***I believe that this project has the potential to do good for the world, and the way we value our data, but I need a passionate dev team to bring this thing to life. So here I am looking for any advice, any groups that you think align with this vision, or anyone who is looking to help. (or if this idea sounds psychotic, I'm open to anything).***

I'm just a young self taught front end dev (that get's a lot of help from chat-gpt), but I have experience building trade proposal tech for financial advisors at [Defi Steward](https://www.defisteward.com/). Also, I have written further about this decentralized data model in the BA substack (not an advertisement, but here is a [link](https://open.substack.com/pub/banklessadvisor/p/internet-society-and-the-philosophy)).

If you have read this far and have ANY comments or suggestions as a start this journey I am all ears.

<summary>u/Ender985 has the latest from the NFT world</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jedxqmn/)

Meanwhile, in the NFT-verse..

Found this interesting development: a real estate agency sold off 20% of a house being rented in Texas, [using NTFs as ownership shares](https://blockworks.co/news/real-estate-investors-buy-nft-home). 

The property was valued at $235k, NFTs represented $100 of ownership (minimum buy was 5 NFTs, would have been easier to just make $500 NFTs..). In total, $45,600 was raised by the sale to 38 investors, who will then get their fractional part of the rent.

Estimating $1500 rent per month (not in TX so I have no idea of what prices look like over there), that would mean each $100 NFT share accrues $0.65 per month, so a median of $7.8 to each of the 38 investors.

Given these small numbers, the company decided to run this experiment on Solana, citing gas fees in ETH as a deterrent, and [bridging difficulties in L2s like Polygon](https://twitter.com/HomebaseDAO/status/1608604222433492992). Let's hope for these investors that when rent is due, the Solana network is still up :)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/129amhp/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2023/jemowor/)

People were discussing u/Set1Less's post from yesterday in r/CC about the Arbitrum DAO drama but we can't directly link to r/CC because the mods there ban you for it. Surprisingly nobody copied a transcript so it's probably gone a bit under the radar in this sub. So here I am, shamelessly transcribing u/Set1Less's post.

> So Arbitrum distributed tokens last week and as per their tokenomics, it seemed that the team and VC allocation is locked for a year.
> 
> Well, they just made a proposal to grant themselves another 750 Million ARB tokens, worth almost $1 Billion from the DAO. They claim its for an "Administrative Budget Wallet". In reality, it looks like a blatant cash grab. Its the first governance proposal and they aren't even trying to be subtle about siphoning funds out.
> 
> Administrative Budget Wallet proposal
> 
> Under the disguise of operational and administrative efficiency, they are seeking to transfer 750 million tokens from the DAO to their own pockets, from which they will make "special grants" and what nots.
> 
> In crypto, these things almost entirely mean cashing out for real world riches. We have seen thousands of examples of teams cashing out treasury funds. In Arbitrum's case, since the team and VC token allocations are locked, they are creating this new channel of funding which they can splurge on while their actual allocations remain locked.
> 
> Some groups have already raised alarm against this blatant cash grab.
> 
> Blockworks Research is voting against this.
> 
> These 750M tokens were supposed to be part of the treasury but now seemingly lay under the centralized control of 3 individuals.
> 
> I hate to say it, but these kind of shady activities actually make people like Gensler right - by using shady structures from Cayman Islands, under the disguise of "DAO", they are staging a standard insider dumping scam where the team dumps token without any transparency while pretending their original allocations are locked.
> 
> Update:
> Apparently it seems that even before this vote has passed, Arbitrum team has already moved 40m ARB tokens to a new wallet, and then started distributing them to child wallets, and it appears from the transactions that millions have been already sent to Binance .

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi shares their thoughts as an ARB delegate</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/129amhp/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2023/jeppfhd/)

I guess a smidge late considering the threads yesterday and today, but obviously I want to post on it since I'm an ARB delegate for a decent chunk of people here.

First, I want to speak to AIP-1 as it stands on it's own as I think it's important for those delegating to get a feel for what I stand for. So for a second, let's ignore the now known issue at hand and presume the Arbitrum Foundation had not moved tokens yet / or I had voted before this was know. Maybe a pointless excercise at this point, but I find it important.

I would have still voted "against" in this case, with request for the AIP to be broken into smaller pieces.

I agree strongly with the first set of a DAO's AIPs being about setting ground rules for the DAO moving forward, especially with one as large as this. Not having a formal process in place can lead to disaster (ominous!), so this is important. However, I'm against trying to lump in too much at once. The obvious one is the 750M ARB to the Foundation Admin Budget, however frankly things like squeezing in a very loosely defined "Special Grants" process aren't a great idea either. Those are things that need fleshed out in their own debates / AIPs. It feels like those are things the foundation would assume would be controversial, but hoped to squeeze through due to the need for the overall framework taking priority. This AIP should have been broken into about 3 or 4 separate things.

Now, with that said and as it stands now, I'm obviously still continuing with my 'Against' vote. The issue I had before has only been exacerbated by moving funds before the vote. In reading comments on this daily thread and it seems that the community is largely asking for an "Against" vote as well, so I have an obligation to honor that within my duties as a delegate. Although honestely it does feel moot at this point given recent events... Others have surely said it better, but the fundamental issue is we can't accept funds being moved without DAO approval or else what is the point of this process? It should be interesting to see what happens now that we have a scenario where funds have been moved without approval from the DAO. Something I doubt will be resolved cleanly, as even before this was found out I was seeing forum pushback on the amount. I question if it will ever pass even upon a presumed rework / revote.

A final note, those who are delegating to me I don't blame you if this has soured the process... this has been sort of a smack in the face to me as well.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/)

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

There was a fascinating MEV "exploit" this morning to the tune of about $20mil dollars as a result in flaw in how mev-boost relays communicate with validators. There is some discussion below in the daily, and here is a good summary: <https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1642848556590723075>


The relay fix to prevent this happening again is here ([https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330)). This does has some significant side effects, the biggest of which is that ~10 sets of relay beacon nodes are now responsible for propagating all new blocks. Our ([u/austonst(https://reddit.com/u/austonst)) relay (https://aestus.live) was taken offline for builders as soon as we became aware of the threat and will update before we come online again. Never a dull day in ethereum.

[u/_etherium](https://reddit.com/u/_etherium):

It's been patched, just waiting for a release to be cut.

[https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306](https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306)

From reading this, the issue has been mitigated and was caused by a bad relay that was gamed. From my undestanding -

Before:

1. Relay sends validator the header (withholds block so not to get frontrun) for signature, but the block is invalid.
2. Validator signs header
3. Relay sends validator the block
4. Relay attempts to publish the block but cannot because it is invalid.
5. Validator selects the top half of each sandwich from inside the block and MEVs them by putting their own tx in a different proposed block
6. No race between the two blocks because the relay block is invalid.
7. Validator gets slashed for 1ETH afterwards, walks away with $20M.

After:

Step 4 and step 3 are reversed. And Relay does not send the block if it cannot publish it first.

Edit: fixed slashing comment, slashed later.

How do you think this would resonate to someone outside of our space?

The internet and information age fundamentally changed how humans interact. Before the internet, blogs were called newspapers, politics & entertainment came through cable TV, and social media was the local bar or a town hall.

Today, there is a quieter, second revolution of the information age taking place. Once again, we are reimagining how humans interact. Just as with the rise of the computers and the internet this new frontier is ripe with opportunity.

The ideas that have captured the minds of these participants may sound as unlikely to you as the internet systems we take for granted today would have in 1990. Eventually this revolution is likely to affect everything money can touch just as the internet did for information. These tools will democratize access to opportunities previously withheld from you and control over these systems will flow to a new generation of tech enthusiasts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Billionaires are already being born of this.

Keep reading and I will introduce you to the new digital scarcity and human coordination tools powering this revolution. I will carve out a landscape of opportunity for you to explore further and help keep you safe while doing so.

Money shapes the world. We are programming our values into our money. By doing so we are reshaping the world.

<summary>u/austonst covers the post-mortem on the MEV exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12c90ok/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2023/jf0ppeq/)

A [post-mortem has been published](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540) about the mev-boost-relay incident a few days ago. The [attack has been](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/) covered [here before](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jesz8la/). But the post-mortem has more details, particularly about the different forms the attack can take, and the mitigations applied.

In general relays are now addressing a whole category of attacks that had been previously overlooked, in which the proposer is able to get access to the transactions in a block to be proposed before they're supposed to. Generally this results in the proposer getting slashed but the MEV can more than make up for it. Attacks include:

* The original form of the attack, in which the proposer signs and submits an invalid block, which the relay accepts, returning the tx contents and giving the proposer a chance to modify bundles as they see fit. Patched (but with some potential side-effects).
* A follow-up to the first form. After the patch, the relay won't return the tx's directly, but a savvy attacker could try to peer a beacon client as close as possible to the relay's nodes, and watch for the block as it begins to propagate around the network. If they can very quickly grab it, modify bundles, create a new block, and use a fast block distribution network to propagate it faster than the original, they might be able to pull off a similar attack. Not entirely solved, still an open question about how to make sure relays will always win the race.
* A form of multi-block attack; /u/t0bii just about [figured this one out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12b9hj4/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2023/jewlml6/). If a validator has two slots in a row, then in slot 1 they deliberately call getPayload late, knowing that they're going to miss the slot. But the relay still reveals the tx's, and since slot 1 is going to be missed, the proposer can modify the bundles and instead include them in slot 2, stealing all the value. Patched, but it's not a perfect fix and may have some serious side effects.

I assume that now that the post-mortem is out, the people more involved in the fixes (Flashbots, ultra sound, EF) are fairly confident that the main attack vectors are decently well patched up. So hopefully things will start to settle down a bit: it's been a busy couple of days at Aestus.

Finally, I want to emphasize a few parts of the post-mortem:

> It is critical that Ethereum has an MEV marketplace that is democratic and efficient. Vulnerabilities like those detailed in this post undermine the integrity of the MEV marketplace and the experience of its users. We call on the security, research, and open source communities to join us in hardening mev-boost and future enshrined PBS designs.

and

> First, we‚Äôd like to note mev-boost and the mev-boost-relay both have bug bounty programs. A potentially expanded bug bounty program is being coordinated.
> 
> Second, we encourage searchers to think carefully about how much MEV their strategies expose, willingly or inadvertently, given the extremely adversarial nature of the MEV market and to take actions to mitigate potential attacks. In light of recent events, we ask searchers to reevaluate all risks in the marketplace: code risks, networking risks, reorg risks, smart contract risks, etc. and manage their risks appropriately.
> 
> Third, we call on the research and security community to carefully study vulnerabilities like these in the context of enshrined PBS, where variants may be applicable.
> 
> Finally, this is a call for your contributions, as a community, to ensure a healthy and robust PBS market today and into the future

Please volunteer if you are a validator or a beacon node operator

There have been some legitimate stakers whose keys have been compromised. CLWP has helped verify their legitimacy and came up with a solution to set withdrawal address and front run the hackers. We need your help. Hackers might be trying to set their own withdrawal address for the stolen validators and you can help prevent theft during the upcoming Shapella launch. By volunteering with CLWP, you can help in a coordinated broadcasting of withdrawal address changes, and ensure that the impacted stakers funds are not stolen. For details on becoming a CLWP volunteer, please watch this video - 

<https://youtu.be/k2Gc-jGxPbw>


It‚Äôs really not that complicated. It just takes a few minutes of your time and is needed right now, before the Shapella launch to help the impacted stakers! You can also get one on one assistance on their Discord if needed - <https://discord.gg/pwuPA6K4zg>

I imagine a lot of people here are interested in keeping up with staking on Ethereum but don't have a ton of time to invest.. I think we have a good system that will help you stay informed about staking in about one minute a day: We're creating one minute clips from our content and posting them as YouTube shorts and on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethStaker). I'd suggest turning on notifications for the EthStaker Twitter and checking them out when it's convenient for you to click.

Right now the clips are covering the goerli Shapella fork, tomorrow they'll include the Lodestar call that's happening today, and around April 1 they'll begin preparing everyone for the mainnet Shapella upgrade maybe with a highlight of previous major upgrade calls. 

I sincerely believe these short-form clips will take EthStaker's education reach to the next level and I hope you find value in them.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/120axdk/daily_general_discussion_march_24_2023/jdgwn51/)

Here's another one: [Barney Frank Was Right About Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-new-york-community-bancorp-flagstar-bank-crypto-barney-frank-fdic-9b825e2e). Written by *the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal*

Free-market capitalism can't work if you are afraid of the government seizing your business in the middle of the night because a secret cabal of politicians didn't like your law abiding business. And it looks like Wall Street is slowly waking up to this unprecedented authoritarian shift by the Biden administration. 

Today it was a bank serving crypto. Tomorrow it is a bank which has labour unions as it's customer base, or a bank which provides services to medical companies that include abortion services, or a company which was not ESG friendly enough, or a company which spoke too loudly and too brashly about the President. Seize em in the middle of the night and fire the leadership board and auction off the assets. Hopefully civic society makes enough noise about this and it's not too late to close the Pandora's box that Biden's staff opened.

Ive posted a bit about exploiting Large Language Models (such as GPT) before, but Im back with more. Even if you have no interest in this, I believe its important to have an understanding of how the data you input in these kinds of systems can later be used against you.

Definitely start by reading <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/jailbreaking-llm-chatgpt-sandboxes-using-linguistic-hacks>. Then proceed to <https://doublespeak.chat/> to apply these concepts.

As of my last post, there were 9 challenges. Forces Unseen more recently released this reflective post <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/llm-sandboxing-early-lessons-learned> along with 8 new challenges available at <https://doublespeak.chat>. 

For a demonstration of how language-based exploitation may be combined with traditional computer exploitation, <https://blog.luitjes.it/posts/injectgpt-most-polite-exploit-ever/> is ridiculously hilarious.

<https://protectai.com/blog/hacking-ai-system-takeover-exploit-in-mlflow> reveals a local file inclusion(LFI) which can lead to complete takeover of systems running MLFlow. This has been patched.

Trail of Bits has long been a leader in infosec research and auditing. <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/14/ai-security-safety-audit-assurance-heidy-khlaaf-odd/> 'We Need a New Way to Measure AI Security' is an interesting read.

<https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/22/codex-and-gpt4-cant-beat-humans-on-smart-contract-audits/> 'Codex (and GPT-4) can‚Äôt beat humans on smart contract audits' offers a much deeper dive into this subject.

And in case this has post not been related enough to Ethereum, by chance I just found this article <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/02/27/reusable-properties-ethereum-contracts-echidna/> 'Reusable Properties for Ethereum Contracts'.

EDIT: Just noticed that doublespeak.chat limits the # of queries you can make before having to purchase more. If anyone defeats the Count of Monte Cristo, Id love a second hint haha

<summary>u/tutamtumikia looks back at all the projects they have invested in over the past few years</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/122blya/daily_general_discussion_march_26_2023/jdrr166/)

Well, I took a good hard look at everything I had put money into in this space over the past 3 years.  When I boiled it all down almost all of it seems to fall into the category of a project run by naive people, run by scammers, or artsy crap that I enjoy but should never have spent so much money on.

Some of defi protocols I tinkered with make me feel so stupid now. 

Here's one.  Tokemak. To this day I still don't quite understand it all.  I popped into their Discord and the team is spending over a half million dollars a month on basically nothing.  $35k+ in one month on "Marketing and Community".  At what point do you just outright call projects like this total grifts?

It's not that it's the only one either. It's a landscape of just gross misbehaviour, scams, and projects run by people who have NO IDEA what they are doing.

 I am SO glad that I only played around in the Defi and NFT ecosystem with total fun money, and left my real stack staked away.  I clearly had no business sticking my nose in any of that stuff.

There are a couple decent projects out there, but I feel pretty discouraged about the entire space today. Maybe having my eth unlocked soon is a good thing :(

<summary>u/pr0nh0li0 shares CoinCenter's coverage of the very alarming RESTRICT act</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je4xyl9/)

We've had a little bit of discussion here regarding the RESTRICT Act, which is the legislation drafted with the pretty explicit intent of banning TikTok if necessary. [Coincenter just put up a great post about how it's broad language is problematic](https://www.coincenter.org/the-restrict-act-creates-blanket-authority-with-few-checks-to-ban-just-about-anything-linked-to-a-foreign-adversary/). The rub:

> we are very concerned that an overbroad interpretation of those powers could be exploited in order to ban Americans from using entire classes of technologies, even when no foreign adversary has an actual proprietary interest in the technology as a whole

A big problem they highlight is that while there's already similar legislation that allows the government to block foreign transactions that are against the national interest (RESTRICT grants the powers to the Secretary of Commerce much like the IEEPA grants powers to OFAC), this law as far fewer oversite and review protections, which is particularly problematic for legislation that provides such broad authority:

> A broad and discretionary power to ban and disrupt all manner of information technologies should not be wielded without appropriate oversight and opportunity for review. The RESTRICT Act not only fails to ensure these rule of law protections, in many cases it attempts to subvert them.

This problem perhaps clearest when one observes that the IEEPA had amendments (the Berman Amendments) added that act as statutory protections for free speech, but RESTRICT has no such protections/limitations:

> Courts have found that the Berman Amendments, in effect, save the statute from potential unconstitutional applications. When plaintiffs challenge a sanctions designation that impacts speech, they can argue that OFAC exceeded its statutory power by contravening the Berman Amendments, rather than making the somewhat more difficult but also more consequential argument that IEEPA, the statute itself, contravenes the Constitution.

> In contrast, the RESTRICT Act has no such statutory limitation. Indeed it is deliberately targeted at restraining transactions related to information and information technologies.

A lot of other good stuff in there about how it could impact Crypto directly as well (e.g. that the Secretary could "argue that the entire class of all Bitcoin transactions, for example, is a class of transactions in which U.S. foreign adversaries have an interest" and should be banned), but all that is to say: call your representatives and tell them they should not support this bill.

<summary>u/austonst has the latest development in the MEV relay ecosystem</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je76vss/)

The Blockswap folks have released their [Proof of Neutrality relay](https://dapp.ponrelay.com/) on Goerli and provided [some documentation](https://docs.ponrelay.com/). I've been following their project for a while, the ideas are interesting. If it works, it's actually quite a large step forward in terms of PBS design. They claim relays cannot see the contents of blocks, there's a MEV smoothing pool built in, and (like the optimistic submissions being deployed by the [ultra sound relay](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) and elsewhere) relays don't have to perform validation before sending a block on. Builders instead post collateral to be used in case they try anything funny.

But while the ultra sound relay's system has the relay operator holding the collateral themselves, the PoN system is integrated into smart contracts with third party reporters acting as oracles to detect violations and penalize offending actors accordingly. All in all it's potentially (remains to be seen) an improvement over the current system

I don't find their documentation to be very complete (or even accurate?), and their recently-published [GitHub repos](https://github.com/pon-pbs) contains [a fork of mev-boost-relay](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-relay) without attribution to Flashbots or a proper commit history. And the actual meat of the system, centered around Restrictive Partially Blind Signatures, is [closed source](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-reporter) and undocumented so far. It's also concerning that their [proposer guide](https://docs.ponrelay.com/pon/pguide) has you input your keystore.json and enter your password (?!). They've confirmed to me that it's only used locally (not uploaded) to prove that you control the validators you're registering, but this is not the way to do it.

It's something to keep an eye on if you're following the cutting edge of MEV and block production stuff, or if you have goerli validators and want something to test. Otherwise maybe hold out for more info.

I urge anyone who hasn't done so to read through the chapter on digital assets in the Economic Report of the President. It's gives a full picture of the deviousness and flippancy of the Biden administration towards crypto. Take this gem on pg 238 for example

> crypto assets to date do not appear to offer any investments with any fundamental value, nor do they act as an effective alternative to fiat money, improve financial inclusion or make payments more efficient; instead their innovation has been mostly about creating artificial scarcity in order to support crypto assets' prices - and many of them have no fundamental value

Complete horseshit. They **do** act as a non-inflationary alternative to debasement of fiat money, today. They *do* act as a self-custodial alternative to money which relies on trusting banks which are literally teetering, today. 

They *do* improve financial inclusion. A kid in rural India or Mexico or Romania can take part in the Ethereum defi ecosystem with just an internet connection, today. Trading securities and treasuries and holding American dollars is a privilege to a tiny fraction of the world, and it's sad to see the Biden ainistration not see this. 

They *do* make payments more efficient. This is increasingly clear for internet native payments. Buying and selling digital native art and culture, paying members of a DAO, transferring funds to colleagues in the same team but all over the world, making small payments in countries like Nigeria and Lebanon with collapsing local currencies - various crypto solutions *do* make payments efficient in these instances, today.  

And last and most importantly of all, is that *even if crypto had no usecase* (which isn't true as I pointed out above), even if, that value judgement is still not the business of the federal government. Here's a great take by Chervinsky 

> [Too many policymakers are playing venture capitalist, guessing which technologies will be valuable and which won't.Tech neutrality is a core principle of good policy for a reason. Picking winners and losers is hard enough for the professionals. Government should stay out of it.](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1638365111508246531)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jcggo1x/)

dang. First time I've ever fallen for something stupid. I went to check out Arbitrum eligibility and clicked the first link under the announcement. The link did look like a scam to me but I had just read a friend comment that the legit airdrop announcement / video "looks like a scam", so my brain had its defenses down. Only connected and *I think* it just took whatever already had approvals? Which was all my DAI. feelsbadman.jpg - 5400 DAI is no small sum. It unfortunately looks like they got a few people before the tweet was hidden.

My brain finally went 'nope' when it asked to approve RPL, but everything before that was just a signature to connect (I think?), not a transaction or approval. 

Things I could have done better (that I usually would do!):

- Matched the twitter handle from the tweet to the actual account    
- Found the link elsewhere (verified it) before connecting my wallet, especially in their discord    
- Generally slow down and read when signing things from my wallet.     

Expensive lesson learned! I'm going to lay down and watch a movie or something, I'm super bummed that I'm a dummy.


Another thing learned in this (thanks to /u/Ribilla_ ) - DAI is a special kind of ERC20 that allows transfers that require only a signature (`permit`, which is a signature-based approval function) - it doesn't look like your typical approval or transaction. So even signatures when connecting to sites should be treated as potentially dangerous and giving away your assets.

<summary>u/bagogel12 and u/Unitedterror on the Euler exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11tipbq/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2023/jck76nq/)

[u/bagogel12](https://reddit.com/u/bagogel12):

I can give a short update regarding the Euler exploiter situation. It's still a developing story ... if you missed episode 1 and 2, you find them here: [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3gqo1/) / [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jceexxm/)

**S02E03 - The merciful hacker (cont.)**

After the exploiter sent 100 ETH to one affected user, DLNews identified this lucky person. DLnews is actually quite good - I didn't know Defillama has it's own newspaper! After [Swap.defillama.com/](https://Swap.defillama.com/) it's another killer product of the Llama universe ...

The interesting part of this episode is: The 100 ETH are actually worth more than what the user lost 78 wstETH (or 86 ETH). Essentially, the user would have profited from the "deal". Being now officially doxxed he sent back 12 ETH to the official Euler depositor address. Is this correct? Who knows, we'll see if Euler will push for the full amount to be returned. It's a subplot which runs through the entire season. ...

For more information on this incident, I refer directly to DLnews:

[https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/)

**S02E02 - The maniac hacker**

Every morning the hacker gets up, he's doing something with his freshly earnt money. If you own $200M you can have some fun with it, right?

So, Today morning, he decided to give 100 ETH to the allegedly North Korean and OFAC sanctioned Ronin Exploiter Address, probably Lazarus controlled. Here is the tx: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457)

Is he trying to fool us? Some kind of weird joke of 21 year old hacker? Or is it some kind of attribution to them? What will come next? Sending some to SBF or Alamada?

Or is he just bored and want his warrant level raised like in GTA?

Before he sent the 100 ETH to KimJongUn, he moved 1k ETH between his wallets but it's sitting there idle. At the moment, in total only 1.5k ETH has been sent to Tornando, the rest still in ETH (85k) or DAI (35 M).

**S02E03 - Tornado Cash Activity**

I did some tracking of the wallets which have used Tornado Cash recently. The activity has fallen quite a bit after it was hit with OFAC sanction rule. So it's kind of easy to track the activity even visually and manually. Here is the result:

[https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db](https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db)

I'm a bit surprised that 125ETH (and a batch of 100 ETH) went pretty straight from Tornado into Binance. The other larger chunks were moved into railgun and multiBTC, only some smaller amounts ran over "privacy oriented" exchanges.

It seems that the merciful-maniac hacker has not cashed their ETH out yet.

Okay Okay -- Heres the official Post-Mortem thread for the Euler hack: <https://twitter.com/TraversaJulian/status/1636782111616122881>

I reposted an earlier draft of it yesterday but I think the conversation here should really be around how safe people felt Euler was.

It was generally considered "as safe" as Compound, Aave, Maker, etc., and having a loss of ~$200m kind of breaks many previous assumptions about safety...

So my only conclusion is that we need to move towards more resilient mechanisms, mechanisms that cost significantly more to execute but are necessary to move forward effectively.

- Rate limiting
- Explicit / Limited Upgradability
- Built in diversification
- Circuitbreakers
- Isolated custodial modules

It really goes on, but these can only be effectively done if we all move towards L2's.

With the arb airdrop, now is the time to push for L2 adoption and the security that we really need to move DeFi forward.

<summary>u/Kukai_walker drafted a letter to their representative and shared the template for you. YES YOU</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11tipbq/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2023/jcm0fi7/)

At the encouragement of u/TheCryptosAndBloods [yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/comment/jcfgbdu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I drafted a letter to my US representative, who happens to be among the 100+ member [Congressional Progressive Caucus](https://progressives.house.gov/home).  I took the perspective that crypto is well aligned with progressive principles so they should engage.  Including here for crowdsourcing feedback to improve it and/or for others to cut and paste from it especially if you too have a CPC representative:

=======================

Dear Representative xxx:
  
\[removed doxxable intro\]

I am writing to you today to **encourage you and CPC to engage actively in policymaking around digital assets (aka, crypto)**.

As one of the 20% of Americans who own digital assets, I have used much of my recent time to teach myself about digital assets and the broader domain of blockchain technology.  This is a highly technical field, requiring me to learn about such areas as cryptography, finance, decentralized networks, computing, and others.  This knowledge has yielded practical benefits in that I have learned how to join thousands of others to stake ether on the Ethereum blockchain which now provides me with a steady income.

This knowledge has also allowed me to cut through the hype, misinformation, and disinformation surrounding cryptocurrency in the popular discourse to conclude that in fact, **the crypto ecosystem of digital assets, smart contracts, and public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has value and will disrupt economic and business systems around the world.** For instance:

‚Ä¢ Decentralized financial protocols allow everyday people to instantly make payments around the world and make loans and other financial transactions without commercial middlemen

‚Ä¢ Immutable and transparent records on the public blockchain can protect intellectual property and assure fair and transparent management of royalties

‚Ä¢ Public blockchains can serve as a permanent store of critical personal events including birth, death, graduation, etc.

‚Ä¢ Assignment of unique non-fungible tokens can help manage ownership and transfer of collectibles, valuables, artwork, etc.

‚Ä¢ Blockchain has potential business uses such as on-line gaming, supply chain management or carbon credit system.

‚Ä¢ The crypto ecosystem can transform the internet business model from allowing dominant internet platforms (eg, Facebook, Google, Apple) to own and profit from personal information to a ‚Äúweb3‚Äù model where the user controls their own data on the blockchain.

I have also been struck by the fact that **there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.**  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (eg, banks, internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all whose trust comes from the decentralized crypto ecosystem in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:

‚Ä¢ Income inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations‚Äîwho under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business‚Äîto build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.  

‚Ä¢ Facilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.

‚Ä¢ Replacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality. 

**Congress must and will create a policy framework for digital assets in the US; it will be important to help shape this policy to promote progressive principles.** Now is the time to act.  Congress will likely see a number of bills introduced this session on such issues as rights to self-custody, defining digital asset taxonomy, and clarifying regulatory oversight.  Discussion on such legislation has already begun in the new Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee which has recently expanded its scope to include cryptocurrency.  This Subcommittee includes two CPC members‚Äîrepresentatives Torres of NY and Sherman of CA.  The CPC can utilize its subcommittee membership and other opportunities to actively engage in shaping this legislation to reflect progressive priorities.

Moreover, **engaging on this issue provides a great opportunity for bipartisanship.** The need for regulation has bipartisan agreement. A number of Republican members have been actively supportive of addressing policy in this area (eg, representative Emmer of MN, Davidson of OH, and others).  It would be remarkable, yet natural, to join forces with the other party on this issue to demonstrate its importance to the American people.

In addition to legislation, **progressive congressional oversight is needed**. I have been dismayed at the administration‚Äôs actions that, in the context of overall banking system failures and under the guise of consumer protection, are inhibiting the development of a regulatory environment that would allow the digital asset sector to prosper.  There are those who believe that the administration is responding to entrenched interests that are threatened by the transformative change that crypto may catalyze, taking advantage of the current banking crises to squash crypto, such as by discouraging banks from holding crypto or servicing crypto clients.

I hope you and the CPC will take on this important issue to both support the progressive agenda as well as keep America‚Äôs leadership in this new sector.  Blockchain and crypto are borderless by nature.  If the US cannot provide a fertile environment for innovation, the developers will go elsewhere and will not be serving the country or its people.

Thank you very much.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard finishes his post on decentralised identity</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ufzg6/daily_general_discussion_march_18_2023/jco0gh3/)

Revised/finished post from the other day.

DID (Decentralized ID) systems are a hot topic right now. They are needed for everything from free to play games, social media networks, and airdrops to governance systems like OPs Citizens House. There is (rightly so) a lot of buzz and various takes on how to approach this topic. I think this is one of the existential risks of Defi and I've written about that [before](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/) (that sure aged well). I'm personally in favor of the [Gitcoin Passport](https://go.gitcoin.co/passport) framework that enables each user to define their own calculation for Sybil Resistance by identifying their stamps and then having an attestation system like I proposed [awhile ago](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good/) compress long form off-chain calculations into simple on-chain maps. The focus of these systems ends at being a proof of humanity per address. They are specifically attempting to solve Sybil-resistance.

However, I think there is the potential to layer reputation systems like credit scores on top of Sybil-resistance and I think the potential of this is largely unexplored. For the sake of this discussion I'll limit reputation to being a purely quantitative, monetary history of honesty rather than history of competence, impact, or ideology. In that context reputation is synonymous with trust. If we want to keep this purely quantitative, what can we objectively measure about something (e.g. code, people, institutions, etc) that makes people trust it? Here are what I think are the three primary pillars of trust:

* **Social Attestation**. When someone signs off on a code review, they are making an attestation. Systems like BrightId and Proof of Humanity are entirely social attestations. These systems are inherently subjective and usually *gameable* so are unreliable on their own but much of the world is entirely built upon attestation layers (your government ID for example).

* **Time**. The longer something has been there the more time attackers have had to inspect it, identify a vulnerability, and attack it. The longer a person has been around the more opportunities have arisen that might lure them to dishonesty. In a permissionless system, time proves doubts to be illusory in the same way that a $20 bill on a busy street is probably fake or glued to the floor the longer it sits there.

* **Opportunity Cost of Honesty**. Watch carefully how trust is used once granted. Any position of trust is exploitable to some degree. Otherwise what are you trusting? Honesty is the degree to which an actor is *suboptimal at exploiting that trust*. Yes, I'm aware how unintuitive that definition of honesty sounds but that's as close as I've come to a formal definition. Your unexploited trust value (UTV) is your maximum exploitable trust - exploited trust.

These pillars stand together to form the base on which a credit system could be built. They are a subset of what Vitalik [identified](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) in his post on legitimacy.

The first two are straightforward to measure. The latter is a bit more like measuring carbon deltas for Carbon Credits, Sybil values, or MEV because the maximum exploitable trust term is so subjective. With PoS Sybil-resistance is derived from the money you have. Conversely, your UTV is derived from the money you don't (in a sense). It's the money you *don't* have because you chose to be honest. This is akin to the forgery-resistance score from Gitcoin passport being floored at the amount you have spent/lost.

The fact that this is subjective (and potentially monetizable) will probably lead to competing standards for how to calculate it much like credit agencies today. Your address will have the equivalent of an Experian score from multiple aggregators which combines the three pillars above into a single number that anyone can query. Each Defi protocol could choose to use a different score, a combination of scores, or create their own score. Could this lead to abuse by an agency? Yes, but less than the current system which isn't permissionless. 

But how do you bootstrap trust if no one will give you a position of trust you can honor/exploit? You can't bootstrap a system like this based on unsecured loans without first getting robbed by a few ten-thousand *Sybilooors*. The capital efficient answer today is to get involved in communities until someone is willing to grant you trust based on social attestation and time alone. That lacks a certain scalability element though. I think we can do better, even while remaining permissionless. You have to rely on some form of *suboptimality* otherwise the system will be gamed for profit. So what forms of permissionless economic suboptimality are already on-chain? The few that come to mind for me are donations to public goods, unrealized losses on airdrops, suboptimal votes in the face of bribes, and delegated credit.

None of these are perfect. The first criteria requires money to bootstrap. The second and third may have ulterior selfish motives the system can't see. The fourth is basically an extension of social attestation and just begs the question. So how do you bootstrap trust on someone with nothing to give and nothing to lose? I have no good answer but the above is the beginning of a formulation.

Why does it matter? Because this value can be integrated into tokenomic systems. I mentioned unsecured lending above, which is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you hear credit system, but I think that's actually one of the worst use cases for this. To explain why, we first have to break Defi collateral into two categories. The first category is money used as collateral for good behavior but which doesn't have a credibly neutral recipient. ETH staking is the largest example of this category but there are many others. The only criteria here is that the system has an objective, enforceable slashing condition. In this category the money just needs to be forfeit by the staker but it doesn't need to **go anywhere**. The second category is money used to reimburse someone. This includes all your money markets, collateralized stablecoins, insurance protocols, etc. It is more viable to use UTV as collateral for the former category. I wouldn't recommend this for the Ethereum base chain because the data to calculate this is on the base chain and this is a subjective score, not credibly neutral.

So where does this get us? Take a PoS system (not DPoS, that's dumb). The purpose of this system is to reach consensus on something. There are two necessary economic components to a PoS system. First, you have to be able to reward honest actors to incentivize participation. Second, each actor needs something at stake they can lose by being dishonest so you have entropy of bad actors over time. I've never seen a system designed so the failure of the dishonest actors is the main reward driver of the honest ones so I assume any such system has a revenue stream attached to it. Now, could we use reputation credit/UTV for such a system in lieu of capital? It certainly satisfies the something at stake requirement. You just have to be able to prevent collusion in the system and prevent bad actors from joining at a faster rate than the dishonesty entropy.

To prevent collusion I'll rely what I call Bitcoin's/Satoshi's great insight. The failure rate of attacking a network scales super-linearly with the number of anonymous actors in that network. This is because the chance of leaking a secret scales exponentially with the network and there is a common Schelling point to unify against dishonest actors once a secret is exposed. This is the *primary* value of decentralization. Past a certain threshold it is safe and profitable to be honest and risky and expensive to be dishonest. So the key to preventing collusion is to increase decentralization and protect anonymity of actors. Defi satisfies this.

To solve dishonesty entropy we're just using a different collateral (which is still a scarce resource). Today we use capital for Sybil-resistance. This does not provably satisfy the entropy condition and so plutocratic attacks on PoS systems today are *possible*. Given the source of this alternative collateral (historical honesty) UTV may prove out to be a superior selection criteria for identifying honest consensus participants.

This actually creates a beautiful sort of flywheel. By acting honestly you build a reputation score. You can stake your reputation in order to promise certain services. By fulfilling your promise you generate both an income stream and further reputation. This creates a compounding benefit to continue acting honestly. A world in which honest actors can build an income stream predicated on their reputation and potentially bootstrapped through community service is also a basis for UBI. It's a step closer to the type of world in which I'd like to live. A few disclaimers though. First, nothing is ever fully proven to be trustworthy. Second, trust is not monotonically increasing. As systems or the world with which they integrate change trust in them fluctuates.

P.S. I've been asked to plug an on-topic game from the EVMaverick's called Layer Zero. The basic premise of the game is to willingly enter into a contract with a group of people who can all openly rug the contract. Everyone has to put a share of collateral into the pot to join. Anyone in the game can take the pot. If no one takes the pot then everyone is generating UTV at the pot size * participants. Conceptually, a set of non-conspiring participants in a game like this can generate more in UTV than the money at stake. While UTV as defined above is scarce if it can be generated faster than capital it could out-compete capital for shares of revenue streams because of this.

<summary>u/0xBOBA hasn't been checking price for the last 3 months and checks in with us</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11vd15b/daily_general_discussion_march_19_2023/jcv3xmn/)

I tried to not check prices.  I lasted 3 months.  I ended up checking because of the SVB news.  Good to see ETH up 50% since I left.  Makes me a little less worried about my CDP.  The $ARB airdrop was a nice surprise too.  Glad I didn‚Äôt miss it while I was gone.  The only other thing I was really worried about while I was gone were my non-ETH holdings. 

With withdrawals coming I finally gave up on my LINK and swapped them for RPL.  More confidence in RPL than LINK.  Should have done it long ago. I got too attached to my LINK and waited too long for the ratio to recover.  (I‚Äôm a horrible trader). Lesson learned there.  But I need an exit plan for RPL. It‚Äôs only 2% of my portfolio though.  

I‚Äôve used this drop in the ratio to unload most of my BTC.  Now only 3% of my portfolio. 0% at 0.055 if my limit orders go through. A part of me wants to keep a little bit of BTC just for nostalgic reasons but I really don‚Äôt see the point of BTC. I skimmed some of the recent dailies and see others offloading their BTC.  This probably means the ratio will continue to drop ‚òπÔ∏è

So now I am 95% ETH and too heavy in ETHE in my retirement funds. Feels nice (other than the horrible ETHE price: what‚Äôs going on there?).  It was kind of nice not checking the price for a few months, but I also missed reading the daily. 

I‚Äôll probably stick around to claim my $ARB and maybe until withdrawals are enabled.  Anything fun to do on Arbitrum these days?   Something that won‚Äôt make taxes a mess next year.

Airdrop Ideas? 

I recently joked with some friends at work about how the ARB airdrop would be my only work bonus this year and, of course, they got super interested. Last Xmas I gave them all RPL and it has tripled in value, but since then they haven't really done anything with defi or crypto. However, I think airdrop farming might just be the push that gets them swimming!

So, I'm compiling a list of some of my airdrop farming tasks that I plan on doing every week. For the uninitiated, I'll provide step-by-step guides on some of the tasks every week if I can. I'll post all that here in the [caches.xyz](https://caches.xyz/) forum: <https://caches.xyz/forums/discussion/airdrop-hunts-checklist/>

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11x8e2l/daily_general_discussion_march_21_2023/jd2chxa/)

Meanwhile, more NFT shenanigans..

535 DeGods NFTs that had been previously burned in Ethereum, were "ressurrected" as ordinals in BTC, at 0.333 BTC per mint this past weekend. 

They all sold out in a single block.

The project dominated ordinals secondary markets, with over $1M in volume, ahead of YugaLab's twelvefold ordinals by >7x. It seems ordinals are here to stay, and more so if they are backed by already established brands such as DeGods.

<summary>u/SoNotYou discusses compromised Arbitrum airdrop wallets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11x8e2l/daily_general_discussion_march_21_2023/jd2b2kk/)

Yesterday some twitter user found out ~2400 compromised accounts all approving ARB. Someone analysed these (actually 2225) wallets and 1791 wallets are elligble for around 3 million ARB total.

<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/sybil-detection/issues/3>

Many users became victim by following links under the announcement tweet. Suprised Arbitrum didn't provide the link to their website with the annoucement or turn off replies. They are not new to how crypto scams and hacks work.

<https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1636352104913666050>

Frustrating to see that so much damage is done. Users have personal responsibility sure. But I think the damage wouldn't be this big if Arbitrum guided users to the right place. Maybe I am a bit unreasonable here... 

Stuff like this can't be happening if crypto ever wants to become 'mainstream'.

<summary>u/busterrulezzz has something to say about Balaji</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11y8xk3/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2023/jd7n6bh/)

I will take Balaji seriously when he goes to explain his theory to people who have the intellectual background to ask him the hard questions.

His appearance on Bankless and the Pomp show yesterday were appalling. Those weren't interviews, they were oral presentations. He could have said that Satoshi was going to come down from heaven to wash away our sins and give us eternal life, and the hosts would have nodded their heads and said "woah."

Balaji is not the intellectual he claims to be. An intellectual does not choose hosts sold out to his cause to make his point - instead, he will go directly to confront those who disagree. This is the very basis of the scientific method. I also find his tone to be alarmist, dramatic, filled with hyperbole created to capture attention.

Who is he, anyway? He is an engineer who became a multi-millionaire in the early 2010s - he has no expertise in finance, history or politics, beyond what he has read elsewhere. Ironically, he made his fortune from the system he says he wants to escape today. His claim to fame is that he "predicted" the pandemic on January 30, 2020. Except that on January 30th, the WHO declared a "global health emergency", Wuhan had already been cut off from the rest of the world, there were confirmed cases in dozens of countries... He was a bit early, sure, but it is not the feat he claims.

Finally, about his $1M prediction, he has already prepared his exit. In three months he will say, "Oh, the bet was just a wake-up call, you shouldn't have taken it at face value, I'm not sure about the timeline, but hyperinflation will happen soon." It won't happen, and he'll push the deadline again and again, until he disappear into irrelevance.

Honestly... best that Coinbase, who's well-capitalized and equipped to handle this, to be the one to go to court with the SEC and set a precedent. A win for crypto against the SEC in court would be a big deal and there's no one better poised to do that than CB.

> Under proof-of-work, computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer amathematical puzzle in order to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive in-kind digital asset rewards. Under proof-of-stake, however, validators, pledge or ‚Äústake‚Äù their holdings in ETH and are randomly chosen to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive an in-kind digital asset reward. By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition between computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake ETH. The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and incentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in staking.

Lol, "*merely* by participating in staking" holy christ project much? Is this a highschoolers essay?

And why is it a security Ms AG?

> the Ethereum Foundation claims on its website that users of Ethereum ‚Äúsee it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over time.‚Äù

Lol just like bitcoin, which even Gensler has clearly stated is the only crypto he views as definitely NOT security? Can't even line up your arguments between agencies...

But wait there's more?

> Since transitioning to the proof-of-stake consensus, the value proposition has altered significantly because possession of ETH translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards

Hey everyone, did you realize that you're earning staking rewards just by holding Eth in your hardware wallet!!!!!

I have no idea how any of this will play out, but I can definitely say that NYAG is a fucking clown show compared the SEC when it comes to this stuff.

Stolen from r WSB:

[https://i.redd.it/gjolf3latzma1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/gjolf3latzma1.jpg)

97.3% of SVB deposits are not FDIC insured. This means, most of \~$200 bln, that used to belong to many, many tech companies and start-ups, just disappeared. Probably many jobs will fallow. 

This truly is a crypto day happening in TradFi. 

Hello 2008, my old friend...

[u/KotMyNetchup](https://reddit.com/u/KotMyNetchup):

According to their latest tweet, Circle stands to lose 8% of the USDC backing at most. It sounds like the most reasonable expectation is that FDIC will be able to recover a decent amount of funds from SVB. I'm expecting >50% to be returned. But looking at the pessimistic side, we have a 4-8% haircut on USDC. $0.92-$0.96. We're seeing that price range now.

The next question is if prices close enough to that range can be sustained long enough for Circle to be able to inject liquidity into the market as needed. I don't know what mechanisms Circle uses to do this, other than promises and market forces. If it comes down to promises and market forces that might not be enough.

Another question is at what point USDC price starts to have knock on effects beyond a simple bank run. A lot of defi is built around USDC. What systems will start to deteriorate if USDC starts to depeg more? At what point do systems start to fall apart?

<summary>u/nixorokish shares The Summer of Protocols</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ngir4/daily_general_discussion_march_10_2023/jbn88dx/)

The first town hall for the [Summer of Protocols](https://mobile.twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1632847129545940992) happens tomorrow, about 9 hours from this comment. 

If you're interested in participating, highly recommend attending! I haven't finished reading the Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols (sort of a manifesto for the course) yet but it's really good so far, very thought-provoking, and I'm thinking of recording a version to listen to.

*edit*. quick synopsis of the Summer of Protocols if you're lazy: it's basically a brain incubator where some very thoughtful people are going to get together and try to define what a "protocol" is, examine existing examples, and how to design one that is future-proof, capable of ossifying to some degree, incentivizes good outcomes, and look at how much stewardship that thing will need. 

This is awesome and, in my mind, the kind of philosophical analysis that we need to make sure Ethereum (or any protocol) has a sufficient amount of thought put into it to try to steer away from some of the dystopian outcomes that something like the internet has brought about.

If algorithms on the internet can change people's behaviors to rapidly foster a kind of hatred that causes people to do things they otherwise wouldn't have, why wouldn't we assume that that behavior-changing power also works in the other direction to incentivize willing participants to better coordinate with each other? This is why I'm here. Because the infancy of Ethereum is the most exciting and malleable part and I think something like this is capable of stewarding it to a place where it actually makes a difference.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ocbsl/daily_general_discussion_march_11_2023/jbtp31j/)

> Literally how can people outside the "cryptosphere" look at crypto and not think "scam"?

A quote from u/geliboy695000 earlier today and I want to repost it here for exposure and discussion because it's important. 

When you look at social media, any time the topic comes up or problems in crypto are brought up, the threads are flooded with bots and scammers shilling whatever shitcoin they get paid to shill. If I were not already in the space and knew what goes on I'd 100% think cryptocurrency is just scams all the way down. And just to be explicitely clear: Ethereum itself has enabled this too with ERC-20s and the like. [Just look at what's literal number 4 in market cap among those tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens) and then scroll down further for all the less popular bs coins like Dogelon & co. 

We need to somehow find a way to exclude the grifters and scammers from the discussions while still being open and true to the crypto ideals, and also welcoming to newcomers and open to new ideas. It seems like mission impossible.

How can legitimate projects be promoted without at the same time giving exposure to the wrong people? How can the general public be educated, because it doesn't seem  knowledge of blockchain tech and its uses has increased that much in the mainstream over the past years. The majority of people still doesn't even seem to understand even just Bitcoin, which has been around for 13 years now and is arguably the most basic and among the easiest blockchains to understand in principle. 

This matters, because if most people do not understand how this tech can help society and how it works, they'll think it's useless and will support legislation that cracks down and hinders crypto adoption. They might cheer the criminalization of private non-KYCed wallets only to find a couple of years down the line to be forced to use CBDC and have banks not only control their money but monitor all their habits as well. It's probably not what the majority wants but if we don't help them understand they won't know anything about it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3nqn3/)

Dear EVMs, EIPanda‚Äôs and the ETHFinance community,

I come before you today to genuinely ask for your help. Please take the time to read this, I know it is long but I believe it is important. No jokes this time. Thanks in advance friends.

As you may or may not know, I started a website called ‚ÄúCaches.‚Äù If you‚Äôve never visited it, I will briefly explain. If you have, then you already know. Caches is a social network/community website focused on Web3 Technology and Ethereum. A place to explore all of the interesting technologies and ideas that are spinning off of this new paradigm that we all love. It‚Äôs completely anonymous, and membership is free and only available via Ethereum wallet login.

I intended for Caches to be somewhere for our community to teach, and share our knowledge outside of the walls of third parties like Reddit or Discord. Something we own, so our voices can be properly heard, and so they can‚Äôt be muted due to some draconian corporate attack on crypto or something. A place where you could ‚Äúcache‚Äù your content and share it with the world anonymously, using identity technology being pioneered by Ethereum. Our mark on the world outside our biosphere. I also hoped we could show the world how you build a community, powered by web3 technology, out here on the old www... A home.

Now I have a lot of ideas, but that‚Äôs the gist of it. I have spent a lot of time in this pursuit and I have struggled with it. The platform I chose to build Caches on, WordPress, has absolutely no help, plugins, or extensions for crypto/web3. Really no good CMS platform out there does. Since I am a terrible coder, and I am already familiar with developing websites rapidly using Wordpress, I chose to move forward using it to save time, for better or for worse. This has been an adventure to say the least.

Recently, I spoke with another EVM, [/u/juxtanotherposition](https://reddit.com/u/juxtanotherposition), and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, just by stroke of luck that on March 24th, 2023 he will be giving a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on *‚ÄúWordpress, Community and Web3.‚Äù* Strange how the world works sometimes ‚Ä¶ Caches is built on Wordpress, it has custom developed Web3 authentication and NFT gating, and it was made for a community‚Ä¶ his very own community! This was literally a match made in heaven! So with all that said, we agreed to feature Caches during the presentation as an example of community built on Wordpress with web3 tech!

That means **we will have eyes from the Wordpress developer community focused on Caches and the EVM!** *AAAAHHHH!* This is why I need your help! Now look, I know I‚Äôm funny, and I make you laugh, and maybe you‚Äôve even checked out Caches once or twice to humor me, and then laughed yourself to sleep ... but I need them to see the value in this. Not just for me, or Caches, or the EVMs ‚Ä¶ for Ethereum.

**Why is Wordpress important?**

Wordpress is a free, open source content management system that powers an astounding **43% of all websites** online. I bet you didn‚Äôt know Caches ran on Wordpress before I told you, did you? A lot of your favorite sites run on it. It‚Äôs free, open source, community developed, and extensible. It also runs on a completely opensource technology stack. Wordpress.org develops the Wordpress software and they are a non-profit entity. Their ethos is very aligned with ours. They want to enable people to have their own platform to share their ideas, and words without having to rely on anyone. You can check out their [about us](https://wordpress.org/about/) page if you aren‚Äôt familiar with them.

**Why is this important for the community?**

Since Caches was built for the EVM/ETHFi community, we have a very unique opportunity to get our ideas, and our community out to potentially thousands of Wordpress developers who will be viewing Caches during @juxta‚Äôs presentation. They will undoubtedly share Caches with other developers. That means we have an opportunity to get web3 ideas and even our community baked into Wordpress! I literally can not think of a bigger opportunity for us, and for Ethereum. If we can get developers to create plugins, extensions, themes and more that enable and integrate web3 technology into Wordpress, we have an opportunity to put this in front of 43% of website owners WORLDWIDE! I can not think of a better group than all of you to guide and usher these people into this new paradigm.

With our help we can get this technology out to the world, and we can foster the Wordpress community during their exploration of this new technology. Give them a place to safely ask questions and get good answers ranging from JBM to Logris level. A place to share ideas, develop friendships and connections ‚Ä¶ just like we all have done through the sub. This is our opportunity to put the community at the forefront of something big outside our walls and build ourselves as an authority in this space.

**What‚Äôs in it for me?**

Juxta has asked if Caches could be a sort of ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù test bed for Wordpress web3 plugins and technology. I like this idea, we get free development work to make Caches the premier web3 community and the developers get a real live site to develop their product. This is a win/win/win! I get to see the thing I started grow and flourish at the hands of people much smarter and more capable than me. It‚Äôs beautiful man! That‚Äôs really it. I hope to use it to make money, however we decide to do that, just like you.

**What‚Äôs in it for you?**

I honestly built this site for our community. I genuinely built it to enable everyone to be heard out here on the web. As I have repeatedly stated, I don‚Äôt want to own this thing by myself. So I hope you can join me, we can come up with new ways to push Ethereum/web3 forward in the web2 and we can come up with creative ways for everyone in the community to earn some money for themselves without turning into a marketing machine. I want everyone to be a part of that journey, and I want everyone to be able to contribute ideas to that goal, and most importantly I want to work with you to figure out how we can own this thing together in the fairest way possible. I don‚Äôt have any of that figured out, but that‚Äôs ultimately where I want to be‚Ä¶ a community owned and operated by the community.

**How can I help?**

Pop in the EVM discord. If you're not an EVM, I still want your help. Please. Join the public-channel and DM a mod to have the "Caches" role added to your account and then you'll be able to see the #caches channel there even if you don't have an EVM. I will use that to try to collaborate and focus our energies best I can. I need you! We have just 10 days to try and make Caches, the community and Ethereum look good... but hey... this is just the beginning. So don't do it for me. Do it for **ETHEREUM.**

Sincerely,  
JBM üëäüèª

Ethtrader donuts were key in the formation of this sub. Not just because it triggered the exodus, but because of the type of people it promoted to leave. 

The people that hate grifts and cash grabs, the people that see this as more than a way to make money, the people that are in it for the tech, etc.

It distilled the community down to those that believe in the original ethos ethereum was founded on, and we do our best to carry forward.

Reporting from the trenches of the great marketplace wars of '23. OpenSea has engineered their next move to combat Blur's rapid ascent into the market. What did they do?

Introduce a new table view! Where the NFT jpg is reduced to a few pixels, just like in Blur. The way art was always meant to be traded!

On a more serious note, this war has already caused some collateral damage, with the royalties race to the bottom. The argument goes that 10k profile picture collections probably should not have royalties, while it makes more sense for 1/1 art pieces. 

Well, the royalties paid on ArtBlocks (an NFT platform for curated artists) has now gone from 7.5% to 2.5%. This suggests that the markets for these two types of NFTs may not be so different after all.

Yesterday two things that longterm members posts and that are not connected somehow caught my attention and made me think. The first one was [this post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jahzvw8/) by Bob Rossi, the second one was [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jah4v8c/) by superphiz in a completely different thread. 

Some personal thoughts with regards to Bobs post: I totally feel you. I want to contribute more in the space and think I would be able to add some value here and there, but hell I am just a random anon on the internet that's mid bell curve. 

But what if superphiz is right (and I think he is)? What if EVMs (which I am going to replace with members of this sub, since not everyone does hold one) will become community guardians? What if this place is something special and if you have established yourself as a valuable and know community member you are highly likely to add value to projects in the ETH ecosystem, hence also hop? What if we used the community we have built here to send people to different DAOs to positively influence decisions made in the ecosystem? What if at one point any EVM and their arguments in a (DAO) discussion are seen with different eyes just because of the NFT?

<summary>Ecosystem: u/wolfparking covers ERC-4337</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11gsztq/daily_general_discussion_march_3_2023/jatsizb/)

This was deployed at the EthDenver conference: [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). Am I right to think that this is a really underrated implementation?

I've read from a few sources that this level of account abstraction will eventually allow wallets to operate as programmable smart contracts; which could be used to recover lost private keys. We're not there yet, but still exciting!

News articles: [msn.com](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-co-founder-buterin-as-key-advance/ar-AA186sIg) and
[BusinessInsider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-founder-buterin-as-key-advance-1032137536)

> Could allow users to do away with the common practice of backing up a set of words on a piece of paper, enabling new ways to secure wallets. For example, users could set up two-factor authentication to access a wallet via biometric data, or program multi-signature wallets providing shared access to a single account.

Additionally, this:

> Vitalik Buterin has stated that ERC-4337 enables a fully decentralized fee market for smart contract wallet operations.

Vitalik [posted](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634): 

> You should be able to send an op into a public mempool, and if it pays enough fees, reliably expect it to get included. This should NOT depend on ANY:
> 
> * Centralized actors
> * Reputation systems for op senders
> * ETH held in a separate EOA
> * External services for account creation

With L2 fee structure the fee requirement diminishes. 

I'm not technically skilled/knowledgeable enough to understand why this integration won't presently allow account recovery, but we're almost there apparently. Vitalik mentions that it can't be solved by ERC-4337, but EIP-3074 and EIP-5003 would get us there. Very cool shit. Anyone want to chime in on anything I misunderstood?

Since anybody can exclude any deposit, it seems it would be difficult to get any type of assurance of your anonymity set.

I also wonder if you can run into a situation where you can't withdraw. For example if a hacker makes a large deposit and then withdraws for others, then there won't be enough funds for everyone else to withdraw if they all want to exclude the hacker.

And not sure why the subsets are even needed if receipts are provided, which Tornado Cash already did.

It's been a long week and Logris has been working flat out to get the project across the finish line. We're about to pitch in a little bit here... still waiting on our time so I can't tell you that. But, I'm really excited about what we accomplished and really Really REALLLLLYYYY proud of him. 

Logris says he's proud of [this function](https://github.com/DavionKalhen/LogrisV1/blob/78b5cc87fe29c7222b38da6624cf9e12503d54af/src/leveragers/EulerCurveMetaLeverager.sol#L158). What a nerd.

<summary>Community: u/austonst has the full wrap up from ETHDenver</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11jq6y5/daily_general_discussion_march_6_2023/jb48g07/)

**ETHDenver Day 10** ([Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jazo2by/))

The final day of ETHDenver! There were no traditional talks from established companies or researchers; today was all about the hackathon teams. Each project was submitted to one of five tracks (DeFi, Impact / Social Goods, DAOs / Community, NFT/Gaming/Metaverse, and Infrastructure) and could also compete for sponsor bounties ([big list here](https://app.buidlbox.io/ethdenver/ethdenver-2023)).

Projects had to be submitted by 8 AM, then from 10-2 teams showed off what they made. On the regular presentation stages, teams went up to the stage corresponding to their track and gave a 1:30 pitch and demo, with a little time for questions. When they weren't on stage, they were downstairs in the main buidl room where the sponsor bounty judges and random attendees could learn about what they made. Track judges picked the top three of each track to present on the main stage during the closing ceremony at 3 PM, then five final winners were chosen.

Miscellaneous notes: I don't think I can see an overall list of hackathon projects, but each one does have their own page if you know what URL to go to. But for most I don't know the URL so it's going to be hard to link to them. I also heard that there was a major hiccup where in the midst of planning out judging, a bunch of teams just got missed entirely and weren't scheduled for a pitch slot or a table location. The team worked to resolve it, but with everything happening so fast some teams were just screwed over. Hopefully it's better next year. Also I finally checked out the arcade area, good collection of imported Japanese arcade games, nice selection of rhythm games in particular.

* [**Logris Vaults:**](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults) A good place to start off the list. DoubtStars has been [talking about this project](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/) so I don't really need to. I didn't find the team on the buidl floor, but I can throw it on here anyway because it's cool.
* **ChainRep:** A project to put security audits and reports (or at least links and a general rating) on-chain. Reviews point to the smart contract in question, and are written by reviewers who are issued certificates by trusted entities like the EF or something. So you could potentially make a DeFi protocol that generally works with any ERC20 token, but checks ChainRep and only allows tokens with positive reviews from certified reviewers.
* **MintUI:** A library of React components for web3 that share information between one another to make web3 programming easier. Main example (as the name would imply) is NFT minting.
* **Composooor:** Would appreciate more insight into this. The team was saying something about how it's hard to build composable dapps/protocols using other protocols that rely on off-chain data. So this is a MetaMask snap (bounty hunting ho!) that simplifies this composability and significantly reduces the amount of code you need to create a clean integration.
* **Dual Rollup:** Cartesi is an [existing platform](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/) I'm only just learning about for developing optimistic rollups whose execution environment is literally a [Linux VM on RISC-V](https://docs.cartesi.io/machine/intro/). This project uses that to run a ZK *prover* on Cartesi, or ultimately a ZK rollup on an optimistic rollup. I get the concept but I feel like I'm barely able to grasp the implications. The team suggested you may be able to implement a universal (or at least cross-EVM) ZK bridge.
* **Alice's Ring:** A project for proof of solvency. With it, tenant Alice can prove to landlord Bob that she has enough assets to cover rent, notably *without revealing the actual address to Bob*. Then, if Alice later uses [zkBob](https://www.zkbob.com/) to actually pay her rent, Bob may never actually have to see Alice's actual assets. The team says that the proof must be computed over multiple blocks or something in order to prevent someone from proving solvency after taking a flash loan. But nothing is stopping Alice from generating the proof then immediately selling, transferring, or gambling it away.
* **Artist Hunger Games:** A pretty wild project in which artists get paid to participate in a hunger-games style game. A DAO of NFT holders have the ability to vote on which artists get removed from the game each round, and can also do silly votes on things like telling the artists where to live or eat. Make it a reality show kind of thing. I was reminded of [Mark](https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_merrill_how_i_became_the_world_s_first_publicly_traded_person) [Merrill](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/), who famously sold off shares of himself.
* **CryptoTaco:** A point-of-sale tool for merchants to accept crypto for payments without having to worry about keys or wallets or whatever. Uses [Magic's](https://magic.link/) tools to onboard merchants using their email addresses. These guys had a lot of enthusiasm, but I'm not sure they're fully aware of how busy this space is. Hasn't bitpay been doing this since 2013 or something?
* **QuestGPT:** Basically [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) implemented as a Discord chatbot, using DALL-E to create images related to the story which are then minted as NFTs. Pretty nice user experience in the end. Not quite the same degree of control as AI Dungeon gives you though. I was told they use multiple AIs (all GPT?) working together to keep track of context/worldstate and regularize the story.
* **Factorial:** Modular libraries/tools for building DeFi protocols, one example being a "liquidation module" for any time you may need to do something analogous to liquidating a user's position.

The following are the finalists who presented at the closing ceremony. These were short talks and it was easy to miss critical details, so this may be quick.

* **Sesame (Winner!):** Allows you to use Ethereum on your phone without internet by sending data over SMS. Has a little wallet interface that can update ETH market price and portfolio value, and lets you send simple transactions.
* **FundPG (Winner!):** A no-loss donation pool that allows users to specify some percentage of their yield to go to public goods.
* **Krypto Kredit:** Some sort of credit score platform using [Huma](https://huma.finance/). Kind of missed the details.
* **Bitcoin Vitalik's Vision:** Fork of the OP stack to post data on Bitcoin, inspired by ordinals of course. Team answered a question about their experience by saying "it sucks to build on Bitcoin".
* **Swappy (Winner!):** Token swaps using natural language queries. You type in "Swap 5 USDC on Ethereum for MATIC on Polygon" and it parses it with GPT, prompts you if you're missing anything, constructs the actual details of the swap, lets you visualize and confirm it, then executes.
* **Rhinestone:** My notes on this literally say "something something account abstraction" sorry.
* **Slang:** Lets you write a single command to generate code to integrate with Ceramic (decentralized data storage) as if it were a web2 database.
* **Inheritable:** Web3 wills for inheritance. Puts inheritances in a Merkle tree for verifying claims. Lets you establish a group of Witnesses who attest/vote that you're dead to start the inheritance process.
* **BaZaarK (Winner!):** I believe this was about selling an NFT but using ZP proofs to do so without revealing all of its traits. May find some specialized use cases.
* **MyMule:** Virtual pet game with a 3D environment where the pets are NFTs. If you interact with it regularly and keep it happy, it prints some ERC20 tokens for you. If you let its happiness bar go to zero then it dies.
* **Synesthesia:** Collecting music NFTs isn't as fun as JPEG NFTs because of the difference in medium. This project creates generative art for each piece of music based on its metadata to make catchy pictures to go along with them.
* **ZKpoEx (Winner!):** This provides a way for auditors to create a ZK proof that an exploit (generally agnostic to the type of exploit) exists, without revealing the specific details of how it works. Good way to do responsible disclosure. Probably my favorite out of the finalists.
* **Tribe.Credit:** P2P lending protocol. You can deposit some capital, then it connects to your phone's contact list and you can say how much you'd be willing to lend that person. If they borrow from you, you don't get to see who exactly it is or how much. If they don't repay you then identity gets revealed and they get kicked out.
* **GasPay (listed as Gasly elsewhere):** Simple token swap tool that just adds the ability to pay for gas in whatever token you want.
* **Denoted:** A medium/hackmd/notion kind of writing site that integrates with all sorts of crypto data and analytics tools to create graphs and visualizations embedded in the posts. Generated dynamically so can update over time.
* **M3mber:** I think this is a way to mint an NFT that represents a membership in something with an expiry date (pitched as a way for DAOs to bring in recurring money like a subscription rather than just the one-off token sale). They use ENS domains, with [NameWrapper](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper) to accomplish this; is it only because ENS domains already have expiry built in so they don't have to code it from scratch?
* **GovBlocks:** DAO management platform. Modular design, has useful things you would expect like DAO members being able to start a vote to change a governance parameter.

That was actually the last day. Some people are sticking around for the mountain retreat, but that's not really something to report on. I'll assemble a final review tomorrow and that'll be it!

<summary>Ecosystem: u/KingLeo23 has more on the fight between crypto and the SEC</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11kqzjp/daily_general_discussion_march_7_2023/jb9othy/)

https://www.veritasanalyticsllc.com/finacial-forensics-news/2023/3/6/law360-op-ed-crypto-is-a-major-question-only-appellate-courts-can-answer

Interesting legal op-ed about the potential future of crypto regulation as the Ripple case progresses through the courts.

TLDR: The conservative supreme court has renewed interest in containing federal agencies to the powers explicitly defined by congress evidenced by WV vs. EPA ruling last year referencing the "major questions doctrine" in the ruling. Regardless of the outcome in lower courts for Ripple vs. SEC, the ruling is likely to be appealed to higher courts and this author at least thinks the SEC's authority over crypto assets falls under the "major questions doctrine" that needs to be decided by congress and could potentially neuter Gensler's further attempts to destroy the industry in the US.

Aaayo! It‚Äôs ya most annoying boy back with mooaar open source software! Now, if you‚Äôre like me, your short term memory is shot due to excessive and repeated blows to the head. If you‚Äôre also like me, your wife makes you aware of that fact no less than 10 times a day‚Ä¶ so you probably take a lot of notes so you don‚Äôt feel stupid, like me. On your phone, the desktop, on the mirror after a shower ‚Ä¶ *Don‚Äôt forget to put on pants today!*

Notes are personal and often contain personal information, subtle details about your life and your extremely valuable intellectual property like your unreleased raps. Are you going to trust that level of information to Evernote!? OneNote!? You know who just bought Evernote? Bending Spoons. You know what Bending Spoons does? AI‚Ä¶ yeah. They want your raps bro! Don‚Äôt even get me started on Microsoft (OpenAI) OneNote! *Ahhhhhhh!*

So, today I present an open source, self hosted, zero knowledge, end to end encrypted note taking app named [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org). Joplin is a full featured notes app with markdown support, image/website/screen clip insertion support and so much more! Syncing between your mobile and desktop can be done with Joplin‚Äôs paid cloud service but they also support S3, Nextcloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem (syncthing?), so you don‚Äôt have to pay more for their cloud if you don‚Äôt want.

They have fully featured, open source apps for Android/iOS and Linux, Windows, Mac and ‚Ä¶ FreeBSD!? *Whoah! So hardcore!* Even the Joplin cloud server software is open source‚Ä¶ ohhh! and ‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs a terminal app for my fellow shell dwellers out there. You can really feel the nerd love here.

<summary>Analysis: u/bagogel12 shares some small new DeFi protocols being built</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11lo2v3/daily_general_discussion_march_8_2023/jbf8b5h/)

You all know, this bear is a builder. Here are some newish, not-so-well-known Defi protocols. As they are new, they are not battle-tested and deployed capital are potentially at risk. Don‚Äòt ape in with your life savings.

**Numoen.com** \- an AMM on Arbitrum which let you access leverage with no liquidation penality, oracleless. It‚Äòs done as a power perpetual ETH\^2. But there is a price,you pay relatively high funding rates so it‚Äòs rather good for short term trades. 

**Sturdy.finance** \- another leverage protocol. Here you can leverage up DEX pool tokens or alternatively lend your ETH/stables to the one using leverage.

**Contango.xyz** \- you can buy or sell a forward contract, and contango borrows on the fixed-rate markets, swaps on the spot markets, and lends back on the fixed rate markets. Sounds complicated, but also fascinating money lego. Be aware: very early stage, in beta with unaudited contracts!

**Ondo.finance** / **fluxfinance.com**: Ondo is gate-keeped (100k min. deposit), so I‚Äòm not sure if you manage to get into their pools (I‚Äòve not tried it). But if not, you can get relatively high APY (currently) on stables (USDC,USDT or DAI) by depositing into their partner protocol fluxfinance.

**IPOR.io** \- an Inter-protocol Offered Rate for Decentralized Finance. It‚Äòs too complicated to explain it in simple words by myself, so I refer to their elaborate documentation: https://docs.ipor.io/

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

In the past, Binance launched its own L1 with the Binance Smart Chain.

FTX launched its own L1 with Solana.

But today [Coinbase commits to Ethereum by launching its own L2 on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809).

This means than Coinbase's interests are now fully aligned with Ethereum, with bridging of users and capital directly to the Ethereum ecosystem. 

This means that marketing made by Coinbase for its chain will now directly benefit Ethereum.

Eth is this L2's native token, with which gas will be paid.

This fully validates Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap.

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider):

While some may find the Coinbase "Base" news underwhelming or would have hoped for something different, the way I see it, this is a huge signal in the crypto space that the number one crypto company in the world is choosing to go all in on building on Ethereum. 

Up until now you could argue Coinbase was "impartial" in its offerings and did not show favoritism amongst coins, but now it seems they are willing to forego impartiality to build on the project they believe in most.

They couldve chosen to enhance lightning network/build an alternative, or build on solana, or the "new" smart contract enabled Cardano, but no they chose Ethereum.

That is something I would consider "significant."

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Maleficent_Plankton goes into detail on the Polygon outage</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ak2qc/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2023/j9sjnjy/)

**Yesterday's Polygon validator "outage" was wild**:

1. There was a [157-block reorg](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388)
1. The [block explorer](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/) went down for an hour
1. Many validators (at least 25) went out of sync and continued to have issues syncing for 12-24 hours.

It was big enough that:

1. Polygon rushed out a **new governance proposal**, [PIP-9](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-9-performance-benchmark-adjustment/11387/4), and passed it within 12 hours. This proposal reduced validator SLA requirements from 98% back to 95% in order to [save 18-23 validators](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators) from getting offboarded due to missing their checkpoints SLA.
1. The co-founder of Polygon stated that they are exploring **[replacing their entire Bor/Heimdall blockchain consensus protocol](https://twitter.com/mihailobjelic/status/1628926312076423170)** with a single-blockchain solution.

**Background**: What happened is that several Polygon validators experienced sync issues, which then lead to giant cascade of outages for most validators. The reason for the reorg is supposedly [a bug between their Bor and Heimdall layers](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388), though the team has yet to give details on the bug.

**Checkpoint SLAs**: Back in Aug 2022, there was a governance proposal, [PIP-4](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956), to move towards permissionless validation.

> "In its current state, the PoS validator network is not entirely permissionless in that the previously-selected set of validators has largely persisted since testnet."

The proposal added an SLA requirement that 95% of median average of last 700 checkpoints are signed by the validator. If the validator fails to meet the SLA, they are placed in a Grace Period have another 700 checkpoints to meet it. Otherwise, they get offboarded from staking. After 2 months, the SLA increased from 95% to 98%.

**What happened yesterday concerning the checkpoint SLA**:

Due to this rule and validators missing checkpoints yesterday, 25 out of 100 validators were at risk of getting kicked off staking.

The emergency PIP-9 vote to reduce the SLA was passed, saving most of the validators. Only 2 validators got offboarded and 5 more are in the Grace Period.

It's good they're finally taking the reorg issue more seriously, but I think they should've addressed this a long time ago.

<summary>Random: u/austonst is doing the ETHDenver daily recaps</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11bdlrh/daily_general_discussion_february_25_2023/j9xiefc/)

**ETHDenver Day 1**

Last year, I attended ETHDenver and [made a post each day in which I primarily summarized the best talks I heard that day](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sxm6cx/daily_general_discussion_february_21_2022/hxswh7b/), and also commented a little about my general experiences at the conference. ETHDenver 2023 has now begun, and I intend to do the same this year. As with last year, the first few days are slow: only one stage with talks starting late and ending early. So not too much to cover.

It seems that, also like last year, [all talks are recorded to Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver), one stream per stage. But for a given talk, figuring out which stage and what timestamp is not trivial. It's not *too* hard either, and for today I figured I'd try tracking down timestamps but I'm really skeptical that I'll want to spend the time on that as the days get longer. If there's one you really want to see, let me know and I can probably find it pretty quick given that I know what the different stages are and can probably recognize the style of a given talk's slides at a glance. But in general I'll link to the schedule page for each talk, which should be enough to point you in the right direction for learning more.

* [Rick Lamanna, Founder of OpenQ](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/d4ef6cc0-2bea-4408-bc63-72d41993415d/8d679f4b-a4d9-4450-9996-571b694850a2) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h14m2s)) talked about crypto hackathons. Gave some general advice on how to best participate and pursue bounties, and then mentioned some trends such as the prevalence of bounties meaning that hackathon teams are starting to say "if you don't pay a bounty for us to use your tool, we're not going to use it".

It was a fun talk about a fun event, good vibes all around. I personally would have been interested in some more of the behind-the-scenes about what it takes to form a Wyoming DAO (and why to do so) and organize a group vacation while maintaining participant pseudonymity, but the conference organizers surprised them last minute with this day-1 timeslot so I know there were some serious time constraints.

There are some good general insights into DAO structure and operation that I found myself able to relate to the EVMavericks DAO. Some of his main lessons: be clear about your governance process, don't try to figure out too much ahead of time, keep open and transparent communication, leadership and hierarchy can exist but should be delegated (and can be revoked) by the community.

On a personal note, it's kind of amazing how much I expect my experience at ETHDenver will be different this year. Last year I knew nobody personally and was generally content to fill my days with nothing but listening to talks and occasionally chatting with strangers. But this year? I didn't go half an hour before I started bumping into folks I know. I have [a project](https://www.aestus.live/) that I can explain to people who ask what I've been working on (and they seem to find it very interesting (!), but I need to stop assuming that everyone knows how staking and MEV work). I tentatively have a hackathon team (with folks from this community) for a project I think will be bite-sized but still quite valuable. And I need to juggle driving back home occasionally for some classes I'm taking, so I've accepted I'm going to have limited free time this next week. But it'll just be packed so full of fun things!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I also have the EVMavericks t-shirts for those who signed up on Discord. I won't be lugging around the huge box everywhere I go, but I'll try to set aside multiple timeslots when I can set up shop in one spot, let everyone know, and hand them out. Got 100 EVMavs stickers to hand out too.

Can't believe there's this many upvotes. Off the top of my head I can think about:

* Finalizing the Merge Event end of March kicking off a major staking reshuffling for probably the first and last time in the networks history. Every single LSD that has a shot need to make their move in the next 2-6 months or possibly never gain share again. Keeping an eye on RPL, BTRFLY, FXS, SWISE for possible shorter term catalysts.
* Upcoming Arbitrum token event, huge amount of new protocols launching on Arbitrum daily lately.

* Base (Coinbase) announcement, dapps and onboarding sooon
* Starkware should continue to drip out news/updates as all these other L2 catalysts take shape, still waiting on their main net launch
* New Rocketpool LSD built on top of RPL to scale Rocket Pool and decentralized staking <https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1630310094981468161>
* ZK Sync onboarding dapps getting ready for their main net launch (soon tm)
* Blur passing Open Sea in volume for many days now, currently lots of active farming possibilities for useless JPGS
* Yuga Labs announcing new NFT project with Bitcoin Ordinals
* Sensible EU stablecoin and defi adoption
* SEC fights against everyone claiming it's a security

This bear market is honestly so much harder to keep track of developments than the last one. All you could do last bear was take a Maker CDP loan and wait for Michael Saylor to buy Bitcoin. Maybe price action stinks but you can never say crypto is boring.

[Edit] Also just remembered Spotify NFTs, Starbucks Polygon NFT rollout in progress, and some of my Reddit WSB NFT's getting a nice premium lately.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

Money should be boring. The fact that we had exciting money for a few years (bootstrapping/awareness phase of Bitcoin, then of Ethereum) is a marvel in the history of money.

If you think about it, new types of money don't pop up very often. In the history of money, we've only really had three major types, invented in 6000 BC, 600 BC, and 2008 CE.

* Physical barterable commodities as monies (backed by physical utility, 6000 BC)
* Trust-based monies (backed by their utility in abstracting away the trade of these cumbersome physical commodities by instead trading surrogate notes representing promises made by a trusted authority, 600 BC)
* Self-sovereign monies (monies that exist nowhere and everywhere as information that polices itself as it floats around, backed by their utility in eliminating the need for surrogacy or trust in creating abstract monies, 2008 CE).

You could argue that the jump from gold-backed notes to fiat notes was another fundamental evolution of money, but in any case we have been very lucky to live through this incredibly special decade.

So now begins the long, boring process of executing on the existing roadmap, and integrating Ethereum with the old, boring economy. We've had our big bang moment for this three thousand year period - perhaps in another three thousand years civilization will come up with yet another fundamentally new type of money and we'll see another big bang (thousands of years from now, quantum physics may allow us to have conversations with the laws of physics and directly ask those laws of physics to enforce certain constraints on our reality, a.k.a. "magic").

In three thousand years though, if the word "I" still makes sense to describe me, if I am even aware at that point of the events taking place on planet Earth in the material plane, and humans do invent a fourth type of money, at that point I probably won't care.

<summary>OPSEC: u/Tricky_Troll has some spiel about spammers and the report button</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11d4bra/daily_general_discussion_february_27_2023/ja9t6dn/)

Thanks for those of you vigilantly reporting the spam post on the front page. A quick dive into the user posting it and the other user commenting in support of the scam found a history of similar posts with the same free reddit awards. Don't trust any supposed uncollateralised DeFi protocols. They're almost certainly a scam unless basically everyone is talking about such a breakthrough.

Reminder of things to look out for in identifying spam and scams on Reddit:

**Spam posts: (if yes it's probably a scam)**

- Did they gain a lot of upvotes in the first 20 mins and then stop gaining traction?
- Does the user history have lost of similar posts or low effort comments about the same product posted by different users?
- Does the post have lots of low tier Reddit awards with relatively few upvotes?
- Does the user have low karma or karma farming indications like having a history of posting in random or low effort subs?
- Does the user and other users commenting in support of the post have a generic usernames with a shared pattern such as "AmazingReindeer123" or "GlowingPancake4679"?

Aside from this, there are some basic rules such as:

- If someone you don't know DM'd you it's probably a scam. Even if you want to be polite and respond to an unexpected DM, don't reveal any info or click any links until you're sure they are legit.
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
- If something raises even just one of the above flags, do some googling and delve into who else is talking about it. If you're seeing no organic looking chat about it then it's probably a scam.

Please remember to use the report button! In a sub with active mods multiple reports always signals to the mods that something needs investigating.

For those of you who are interested, this is the user who posted it and take a look and see if you can see the patterns of a scammer in their posts and post history. <https://reddit.com/user/SpicateHammer451>

My brother: So how's it going with that secret little thing you are doing with Ethereum, that miner sitting on your desk? You must be very smart how do you manage it? Must be a lot of work.

Me thinking: Oh that's right I'm running a validator I almost forgot.

That thing is still running perfectly turning dust into ETH without looking at it for months. Yes, staking is very hard and mind consuming. All I do is wait for my phone to prompt an update and then I run the ethstaker wizard after a few weeks. I am very sramt!

This week I managed to get my coworker into solo staking without telling him I am one myself, but I think he knows. Dude is already heavily invested in getting the best performance out of his machine. What a nerd (He's actually a very nice guy that just loves computers). Tells me he has a lot of unused parts freshly bought just because they were off price. He was flabbergasted about the low specs needed and was kind of disappointed. I guess he was expecting to run some sort of data center in his home?

Maybe I'll tell him to run a Solana node instead, if he really wants to drown in debt and get no profit at all (even run at a loss). Good thing is that he understands. He immediately linked the correlation about decentralization needing easy hardware to work the most efficient. Can't expect normal people to run data centers right? They have the money, but not the technical knowledge. They do not want a beefy machine taking their electricity and bandwidth away. These were his exact words, and I was astounded by his quick thinking.

I wanted to direct him to the right sources to run a validator but he was already talking about running Geth and Lighthouse and was talking about all sorts of Linux command stuff. He was already smarter then me about validating in one day. I guess he's going to be just fine.

Coworker, if you manage to cross this post and recognize me. Doxx me and I will tell your mother!!

<summary>u/superphiz has a disclosure to make but it still putting values first</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/113jhtv/daily_general_discussion_february_16_2023/j8t3bo9/)

I want to disclose that I've contracted with EY to offer community education regarding their Nightfall and Starlight products for a few months. This isn't a full time job, just an agreement to spend more time learning about Nightfall and Starlight, then sharing what I've learned.

Let me give you some idea what this means. My credibility to the community is the most important thing I have in crypto, so I'll never do or say anything that would degrade that credibility. Many people who know and trust me hold that trust because I'm extremely selective about things I talk about. I focus on highly aligned projects that add value to the whole ecosystem and don't extract value for anyone. You might know that EY's privacy tools led by Paul Brody's team fill that niche for me, and I'm very confident about that fit after knowing Paul several years.

My intention is to learn more and share more about Nightfall and Starlight and help them find the traction they deserve and I hope you'll join me in this quest. If these tools succeed in the market, Ethereum will be the greatest beneficiary.

I need you to know that I can't be bought. I'm agreeing to this contract because it's good for the web3 community, our community, Ethereum, and EY. I believe that any greater knowledge we develop about these products will benefit all parties in the long run.

I will always continue to do my best to earn your trust as I find the best tools and opportunities to share with other Ethfinanciers, but I also need you to put your own judgement first. Ask yourself if I'm doing things that make sense for all of us or if I've lost my way. Follow your own good judgement, not mine. <3

So it is with great pleasure that we want to relay that Coinbase Ventures has invested in the protocol. We recently announced their intentions to join the oDAO, so this is just another step in them willing to back a decentralised staking protocol such as Rocket Pool.
  
"We're excited to announce that Coinbase Ventures is deepening its partnership with Rocket Pool via a direct investment into RPL in addition to its proposed entry into the oDAO. Coinbase Ventures also plans to use their RPL and ETH to spin up their own Rocket Pool minipools."

I‚Äôm in a discussion with a community member that I respect very much, yet strangely we do not seem to agree on something. 

Question for the fam:

If Coinbase would start spinning up Rocket Pool minipools instead of regular validators from today on, would this be good, bad or neutral for decentralization?

Please limit the discussion to this question about decentralization only. I don‚Äôt want it to be a value judgement on Rocket Pool. Of course any actor can use it as it is permissionless. This is not a fault of the protocol. Also please don‚Äôt discuss how unlikely or likely it is that Coinbase would do this. It might be very unlikely with all the risks (RPL exposure, regalutory, other). I just want to know if you think my hypothetical question would be good or bad for decentralization

[u/kainzilla](https://reddit.com/u/kainzilla)

You asked me to post my comment in reply to this thread, but I think it might be worth re-writing it suited for some of the answers I see here. I'm going to write this as if the LEB-8 (8 ETH minipools) are in effect, because that is the long term goal. For anyone reading this not familiar with Rocket Pool, the current version of minipools instead has 16 ETH from the minipool operator and 16 ETH taken from the rETH pool. This difference doesn't impact the following statements, with the exception of making the barrier-of-entry lower.

&nbsp;

# Is it good, bad, or neutral for major staking entities to use the Rocket Pool protocol?

**Answer:** I believe the effect on decentralization is neutral, but in spite of that neutral effect from this factor alone I think it would be _actually devastating_ to Ethereum's prospects to shut out large entities, due to runaway centralization behind 2-3 broadly used liquid staking tokens. Here are my thoughts.

&nbsp;

# Important Note: What does Rocket Pool do to help decentralize the network?

1. It lowers the barrier to entry for a solo staker from 32 ETH, down to 8 ETH + a portion of collateral (roughly a 70% reduction in initial capital required).
2. It gives parties interested in acquiring staking services access to a service pool that isn't monopolized by a single entity (it is permissionless).
3. Specifically note that "gives more nodes to smaller stakers" isn't in this list. This will be addressed below.

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 1: Comparing centralized entity Rocket Pool use to centralized entities not using Rocket Pool

* The protocol is permissionless, and you cannot prevent any size staker from using it.
* The permissionless feature is non-negotiable, as otherwise centralization is a factor and the protocol is pointless.
* Desire to deny large entities from using it is pointless, and large entities staking in RP should be considered a likely outcome.
* Are features #1 and #2 outlined above compromised by large entities using the protocol? I believe these features are not compromised.
* With that in mind, the comparison of centralized entities using Rocket Pool vs. not using it results in a net neutral comparison minus a concern addressed in the next section.
* A much more important comparison when thinking about Rocket Pool usefulness is "How does this compare to the situation without any Rocket Pool?"

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 2: Increased node counts for centralized entities using Rocket Pool

Some comments here point to the fact that small stakers can obtain a 4x node power "multiplier" against large staking entities, and that large staking entities entering the picture defeats this purpose. This is a fallacy, however:

* **If you could** engineer a Rocket Pool protocol where you could magically keep out large-entity stakers, you could then tout "increased node counts for small stakers" as a decentralization-increasing feature of Rocket Pool, but that feature would only function up to the number of small node operators you would have available in the pool. Once that pool of small stakers runs out however, no further rETH could be created.
* Any demand for staking services beyond what rETH capacity exists would then likely flow over to centralized staking entities outright. Meaning that they would be spinning up more nodes, _just as if they had spun them up from rETH-provided funds_. It would literally just end up a 1:1 conversion.
* The end result of this hypothetical scenario where you block out large stakers, is that you have lost:
    1. The permissionless feature, and more importantly,
    2. you've seriously handicapped the value your accessible-to-all staking services access pool due to the low ceiling of possible funds, and the fact that you just forced a huge number of customers over to centralized entities providing liquid staking tokens.

&nbsp;

The same scenario effectively plays out if you make the comparison of centralized entities using RP vs. RP not existing:

* In this scenario where Rocket Pool doesn't exist, it's once again a very, _very_ safe assumption that people whom are already comfortable delegating their funds for staking on the network, would instead use centralized services for their staking instead.
* This means that it's safe to assume that all funds flowing into rETH in the centralized-entities RP scenario would instead just be... with those centralized entities you're concerned with.
* Now, in this scenario, there isn't an accessible-to-all staking services market at all, and it's almost 100% guaranteed that one staking service is going to become popular on a runaway level purely due to the convenience of having a single liquid staking token. Lido almost did this on accident purely by being early to market and being able to expand rapidly.

&nbsp;

Considering those two scenarios, node counts for any of these scenarios are **irrelevant and are not a factor in comparing any situation for Rocket Pool**. The fact is, Rocket Pool _will_ actually give a slight node-power advantage to decentralization, but only by virtue of feature #1 - _the reduced barrier-to-entry._ There is no scenario where Rocket Pool increases the amount of power a centralized entity has in comparison to Rocket Pool not existing, or locking centralized entities out.

# The actual strength of Rocket Pool decentralization

So what's the actual strength of Rocket Pool? It's specifically item #2, the accessible-to-all staking services pool. The lowered barrier to entry for actual node-operators at 8 ETH is to be frank pretty awesome and amazing, and it's going to let a lot more people into the ETH staking ecosystem, but the point that people keep missing about the accessible-to-all staking services pool that is provided is that it **keeps the biggest liquid-staking token out of the hands of a single entity**, or at the very least provides a nearly-unstoppable competitor. If Rocket Pool didn't exist, staking-services users would have **nowhere** to send their money except centralizing forces, and what's more is that small operations wouldn't be able to attract staking-services customers for shit - nobody would use little-known liquid-staking tokens, and the small operations would get crushed on margins by the big operations.

Every centralized entity that joins this accessible-to-all pool makes it that much harder for any centralized entity to monopolize the liquid-staking-token market, and even better, the protocol itself isn't really able to use it's own dominance of the liquid-staking market to try and shut out competitors except by trying to provide better service to keep people using rETH - so even competitors will still be able to rise up if they make something truly great. The protocol can't blacklist competing liquid-staking tokens on the protocol's (non-existent) exchange, the protocol can't make back-room deals to give more favorable staking percentages to special, favored customers, the protocol can't lock out small staking providers that the big providers don't like.

Rocket Pool can't actually shut out centralized or large entities by design, and it also shouldn't because doing so is inherently a bad idea. Any centralization of node operators on the Rocket Pool protocol would have existed without Rocket Pool, and if you try and shut them out that money gets transferred _right over to external centralized entities anyways_. Rocket Pool's design has likely averted a scenario where a few major exchanges dominated the entire staking services market on the Ethereum chain, which... to be honest, I think would have truly killed the decentralization angle and left us with little claim to security.

Heads up, I received an unsolicited call this morning allegedly coming from Coinbase support indicating that my account had been logged into from another country and that they were placing a hold on my account. While on the phone they sent me an email confirming this and a text message with a link to hxxps://issue-coinbase.com/email=?[EMAIL] to reset my account. They then gave me an 8 digit password over the phone with which to login.

I pretty much knew from the start that this was bullshit but the hxxps://issue-coinbase.com domain really sealed it. If you get any unsolicited calls from any exchange *please* ignore it, and maybe report it here for educational purposes. Stay safe out there.

> Anyone with an ounce of understanding about economies knows why a DEFLATIONARY currency could never work as the standard.

As the standard for what? Buying eggs and bread? Paying people's salaries? Investing in stuff? Sure. In that case, a deflationary, value-appreciating currency is bad. Thankfully that's not what Ether is.

> We need money to lose value over time to deincentivise people sitting on savings.

The first and foremost job of Ether as an asset is to provide economic security to Ethereum. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" about that realizes it'd be dumb to devalue this asset on purpose. Ether is collateral money, not debt money. Having the value of your collateral go up gives you more bandwidth to participate in the economy by doing more stuff you otherwise couldn't

> Only when money is used does it lube up the economy by providing cash flow for industry.

Again that's not really Ether's job to do that, but even then it still does it well inside the Ethereum economy: it's deflationary BECAUSE it's being used. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" quickly realizes this cause and effect relationship and doesn't invert it by claiming being deflationary causes people to not use it.

Ethereum sells blockspace and blockspace accessories. This blockspace is *worth* something, people are willingly paying for it, choosing to burn their precious deflationary ETH in exchange for it. There is no "bad money drives out good" when it comes to buying blockspace, thanks to EIP-1559.

I'm tired of these takes that miss out on all the nuance. "ETH deflation bad because deflation encourages hoarding" is one of them. And yes, "ETH deflation good because supply goes down = line go up" is another one. It's a cringe meme responding to Bitcoin's equally cringe "capped supply = sound money" meme.

The truth is fundamentally, whether the supply goes up or down doesn't affect the velocity of ETH. Whether supply goes up or down, it's all just an accounting trick that doesn't change the fact that value ultimately flows from *users* (paying for blockspace) into the pockets of *holders* (who are likely to be staking, directly or indirectly). You're not magically gonna turn a hoarder into a user if you increase issuance, because that hoarder is already staking anyway.

It's quite a brilliant feature of eip 1559.

If demand for blockspace falls below a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes up while gas prices go down. This has the effect of making it more likely for more people to use ETH, bringing us back to more demand for blockspace.

If demand for blockspace is above a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes ultrasound. More ETH fees are burned instead of given to validators.

If staking becomes extremely desirable, and more and more people stake,  staking rewards APY falls, and the threshold of blockspace demand required for fee burns increases.

If staking becomes less desirable and more and more people unstake, staking APY increases and the threshold for fee burning falls.

It's a completely automated, decentralized monetary policy which favors equilibrium. Nothing else on earth like it.

Ethereum eip 1559 increases incentive to secure the network in a way that avoids inflating the supply, without being 100% reliant on market forces such as gas fees. Unlike Bitcoin security which will eventually become completely enslaved to the wills and fluctuations of the market, and without sufficient fees (blockspace demand) will become more and more centralized and less and less secure.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/118qid5/daily_general_discussion_february_22_2023/j9k2c6k/)

Very interesting speech just given by Augustin Carstens, the General manager for the BIS. Pay close attention to the last paragraph/bolded text. They totally understand the power of shared ledgers/opensource/composable. They just want to centralize it and own it.

edit: formatting; summarizing a little bc the kicker comes at the end of a wall of text.

&#x200B;

> A unified ledger is a digital infrastructure with the potential to combine the monetary system with other registries of real and financial claims. It would need to be a public-private partnership with a clear division of roles, and where the central bank is tasked with underpinning the trust in money.  
>  
> Like smartphone platforms, a unified ledger allows various components to work seamlessly together. But unlike them, it is enabled by open architecture that promotes financial inclusion and greater competition.  
>  
> Such a ledger allows for the use of smart contracts and composability. A smart contract is a computer program that executes conditional "if/then" and "while" commands. Composability means that many smart contracts, covering multiple transactions and situations, can be bundled together, like "money lego".  
>  
> With these new functionalities, any sequence of transactions in programmable money can be automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions that delay transactions and reduces dependency on intermediaries, and also allows for simultaneous and near-instant payments and settlement.  
>  
> Greater interoperability and automated transfers could ultimately benefit consumers through more convenient and cheaper products that are better tailored to their needs, thereby enhancing financial inclusion.  
>  
> These foreseeable gains may just be the tip of the iceberg of additional transformations. Think about how the smartphone displaced digital cameras. It was not because it takes better pictures, but because it's easier to share these pictures with friends through the same device.  
>  
> **Importantly, programmability and composability do not require decentralised or permissionless platforms. All the potential benefits I just outlined can be achieved in permissioned platforms with various degrees of centralisation.** What really brings the benefits of these projects together is the use of money as a means of payment and settlement. As the provider of the ultimate settlement asset in the economy, the central bank therefore has an important role to play in the governance of a unified ledger. But it would do so in partnership with other public agencies as well as with private sector participants.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/oblvnxknight the one sane person at the SEC seems to have little influence</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10xn2mv/daily_general_discussion_february_9_2023/j7wt9wm/)

The one sane person at the SEC seems to have little influence - she's echoed this sentiment for a few years now and not much has changed. Not a criticism to her, more a comment on the SEC's approach to regulation being firmly entrenched

<https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1623796583807451139>

Today, the SEC shut down Kraken‚Äôs staking program and counted it as a win for investors. I disagree and therefore dissent.

Kraken operated a service through which its customers could offer their tokens up for staking. The customers earned returns, and the company earned a fee. The Commission argues that this staking program should have been registered with the SEC as a securities offering. Whether one agrees with that analysis or not, the more fundamental question is whether SEC registration would have been possible. In the current climate, crypto-related offerings are not making it through the SEC‚Äôs registration pipeline. An offering like the staking service at issue here raises a host of complicated questions, including whether the staking program as a whole would be registered or whether each token‚Äôs staking program would be separately registered, what the important disclosures what be, and what the accounting implications would be for Kraken.

We have known about crypto staking programs for a long time. Although it may not have made a difference, I should have called for us to put out guidance on staking long before now. Instead of taking the path of thinking through staking programs and issuing guidance, we again chose to speak through an enforcement action, purporting to ‚Äúmake clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.‚Äù[1] Using enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating.[2] Moreover, staking services are not uniform, so one-off enforcement actions and cookie-cutter analysis does not cut it.[3]

Most concerning, though, is that our solution to a registration violation is to shut down entirely a program that has served people well. The program will no longer be available in the United States, and Kraken is enjoined from ever offering a staking service in the United States, registered or not. A paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in this settlement: do not initiate a public process to develop a workable registration process that provides valuable information to investors, just shut it down.

More transparency around crypto-staking programs like Kraken‚Äôs might well be a good thing. However, whether we need a uniform regulatory solution and if that regulatory solution is best provided by a regulator that is hostile to crypto, in the form of an enforcement action, is less clear.

<summary>Random: u/busterrulezzz found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10yhsb2/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2023/j7zb05g/)

This is going to be long, sorry.

I think I've found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society, especially with respect to the (sometimes) irrational hatred for the protocol.

I believe that as a public good, Ethereum is like a large public transportation project.

Indeed, every Western city that has decided to invest in such projects has faced absolutely incredible opposition. In Bordeaux, France, the tramway project caused protests, arguments, political riff raff - a non-negligible portion of the population swore that they would never use the tramway, because they were opposed to it from the beginning.

Now, two decades later, Bordeaux is a model for major European cities, and the opposition has disappeared. The ridership of the tramway is extraordinary, which suggests that even the most furious opponents have pounded on their pride and are using the service when they need it.

It's the same everywhere. When London wanted to reduce the number of cars in the city center, the anger of the citizens was incredible. Twenty years later, no one would go back. I experienced it personally in Montreal: the current mayor built bike lanes on major commercial arteries, which led opponents to predict the imminent death of downtown. Four years later, the city's liveliest thoroughfares are the ones that received new bike lanes, and absolutely no one is calling for a reversal - even the most rabid opponents.

This got me thinking. Why were these citizens so fiercely opposed to a public good? On what arguments was their opposition based?

I went back and read their open letters and angry tweets. Basically, the opponents were concerned that the loss of parking space would hurt business, create traffic congestion, and make the city ugly (!).

Literally none of this has happened. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. 

Now, let's ask ourselves why these arguments overrode the emotions of the opponents. My theory is that it is a "failure of imagination": an inability to imagine the world differently, to find creative solutions that are outside the current paradigm. They are stuck in the only model they know, and are unable to believe that another world is possible. 

There is also, in my opinion, an element of ego. Many of the opponents were at the top of the social pyramid - wealthy businessmen, popular TV hosts, bourgeois, etc. The world as it is has been extremely generous to them, so why change it? Besides, the idea that a revolution could arise from outside the system that brought them into the world is frightening for them. It means that their privileges are not so solid after all.

I believe Ethereum is in a similar situation.

Our protocol is a public good. It belongs to its participants, and literally any human being can deploy an application on it. This is an absolutely revolutionary idea from the outside - have you seen what Vitalik looks like? It's impossible that a nerd like that, with no credibility in high society, has come up with something good. So his creation is necessarily a fraud, which must be fought

So these opinion leaders declare Ethereum an enemy to be fought, and the citizens used to following what the top of the pyramid tells them jump on the bandwagon, without asking themselves if their fight is really relevant.

TL;DR : Ethereum will (hopefully) follow the same trajectory as public transit projects.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/mgr37 explains the use of the validator mnemonic after the withdrawal address is set</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1108k4a/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2023/j88acu5/)

Good question !

As I understand it, yes the seed will no longer be useful for normal operation:

- once withdrawal address set, it can't be changed
- partial withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.
- exit is triggered with validator keys (the one used to run the validator client) and actual full withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.


BUT you would still need it for:

- derivating new validator keys from the same seed (not compulsory, you could use a new seed for new validators, but might be handy -> see next point)
- re-generate your validator keys in case they got lost (i.e. staking rig hard drive crash). I think that's the main reason to keep the seed (and use the same seed when rolling new validators). 
You could backup the keys instead but it's easier to keep a seed backup than keys backup IMO.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Blueberry314E-2 does some research on the SEC vs BUSD</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1111020/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2023/j8euz36/)

Some of my own research on SEC vs BUSD:

The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has told Paxos to stop making its own version of BUSD (a digital currency) "as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos‚Äô oversight of its relationship with Binance in regard to Paxos-issued BUSD."

Paxos‚Äô BUSD product is **related to, but separate from**, Binance‚Äôs self-issued *Binance-pegged BUSD*. Binance‚Äôs *self-issued BUSD*, which is not directly regulated by NYDFS, **is independently wrapped and issued by the crypto exchange on blockchains beyond Ethereum**. In other words, Binance can take a single Paxos-issued BUSD, create an *analogous BUSD* on another blockchain (like Binance‚Äôs own blockchain, for example), and freeze a corresponding Paxos-issued BUSD. ‚ÄúThe Department has not authorized *Binance-Peg BUSD* on any blockchain, and *Binance-Peg BUSD* is not issued by Paxos."

So the issue here is not 'true' BUSD issued by Paxos. The problem is that Binance was sneakily issuing alternative *unregulated BUSD* on it's own blockchain and others, and passing them off as the real, regulated, Ethereum based BUSD issued by Paxos.

Paxos has told its customers that it will end its relationship with Binance for BUSD. The DFS is watching Paxos closely to make sure it can handle redemptions properly, following new safety rules. **It's important to know that Paxos was allowed to make BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain, but** ***Binance-Peg BUSD*** **is not approved or made by Paxos.** There are no restrictions from the DFS for New York companies to list or trade the existing Paxos-issued BUSD.

Looks to me like Binance is to blame here, SEC is just trying to clean up their mess.

<summary>Random: u/Lazy_Physicist has a cool idea for once Stakewise V3 launches</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/111vdwx/daily_general_discussion_february_14_2023/j8kik5e/)

Regulatory news aside, I've just had a thought. Stakewise v3 would allow node operators to set up vaults with whitelisted addresses for allocators. This in theory allows us to set up vaults where only holders of EVMavericks/EIPandas/etc. are allowed to deposit ETH into. I'm sure there are others here like myself who have overallocated on the hardware for our own staking rigs or have extra bandwidth. If I were to use swise I would probably set up multiple vaults if I didn't have to provide any collateral to do so. A vault or two to stake for "members" who can't or won't solo stake free of commission, then however many public vaults I want to run with a commission. This could be an interesting way for communities to drive value to their NFT Collections.


Edit: SWISE staking taking a share of the fees will probably factor into how feasible this is

<summary>Community: u/cheeky-gorilla reports back from the Edelweiss Interop Workshop</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10rigcl/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2023/j6wdzn9/)

By now you've probably heard that last week was the [Edelweiss Interop Workshop](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1620095331252981760) (the successor to the [Amphora Interop](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone)), where Ethereum's core devs spent a week together in the mountains to work on withdrawals, 4844 (aka proto-danksharding) and EOF.

I was invited to join due to my work on the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and - even though it still feels like a dream - I wanted to share my experience, especially as someone without a technical background.

Was the workshop a success? Absolutely. To quote a core dev, "we left with a flawless Capella/Shanghai fork", and there was a 4844 testnet with all but one client team! 4844 in July? üëÄ

I'll admit I was INCREDIBLY nervous going into this event, I couldn't sleep properly for days in advance - I was literally going to meet the majority of my heroes, and I was 100% going to be the dumbest person in the room at all times.

Well, I can happily confirm that "you should never meet your heroes" does NOT apply to Ethereum's core protocol contributors. These are some of the most interesting (and surprisingly funny) people I've ever met, and even though there was [a lack of diversity](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1620438540328005633), they came from all over the world, with all sorts of different backgrounds. And despite the fact that the price of ETH is never discussed on ACD calls, I can confirm that Ethereum's core devs are bullish: I heard more than one conversation about [ultra sound money](https://ultrasound.money/), and [RatioGang](https://ratiogang.com/) was also strongly represented! I'm an introvert, but everyone was so incredibly welcoming and kind, I never had any issues talking to people.

Overall, the passion these individuals have for Ethereum is genuine and contagious, and I feel more confident than ever in Ethereum's ability to execute its [roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1588669782471368704) while staying aligned to its values of decentralization, openness and long-term thinking.

Other highlights included organizing a core dev run one morning, and as a pretty hardcore privacy enthusiast, I even had the pleasure of giving privacy tips to Vitalik! Oh and there was that one time that Danny Ryan wasn't allowed at dinner because he was wearing flip flops üòõ

I'll end with one note of encouragement for those who need it: if I can end up at this kind of event, then so can you. To quote Danny Ryan, "doors are wide open at Ethereum". My "door" was the Protocol Guild booth at Devcon Bogota, where I asked Trent and Tim if they needed any operational help with the Guild, and turns out they did! (For the introverts, I passed by the booth 3-4 times before I gathered up the nerve to talk to them - don't let shyness gatekeep your passions!). Now I spend my time coordinating / helping with the Guild's [v2 architecture](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html#v2-architecture) upgrade, fundraising and marketing, all without a technical background.

This comment is already much longer than I expected, so I'll end it here. TLDR: everything good about Ethereum is reflected in its core devs, and the barriers to entry are probably lower than you think!

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Canadiens1993 thinks that US tax laws are inhibiting solo staking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10scsic/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2023/j730mpx/)

**Unclear Tax Treatment for Staking (USA):  Centralization Vector?**

Let me explain.  Retail has a choice:

\- Staking on, say, Coinbase and it prepares and sends you the requisite tax form every year.  You forego a small percentage of your staking rewards in exchange for this service, and you must  entrust your ETH with a regulated custodian (centralization risk); or

\- per current IRS position, solo stakers must record revenue for each attestation (every 6 min), for each block produced (random) and tips/MEV (random).  There is a valid legal argument for staking rewards to be taxed when sold (not when received), but the IRS has dismissed it - [https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking). So what does this mean in practice.

1. **Taxable income**: Setting aside how to deal with Shanghai and managing price volatility given the queue for withdrawals, you'll need to record revenue every 6min for the ETH received as taxable income (currently: 13329 GWei) at the value on the date/time "received"; and then (and this is where I lose my shit);
2. **Capital Gain/Loss Tax**: if and when you sell ETH in the future you will need to record a capital gain/loss using the cost basis above for that petty 13329 GWei received.  You will never be selling only 13329 GWei.

If you think I just made the case for LSDs, then you understand the problem.  Maybe this can easily fixed with more sophisticated tax software?    **WE NEED TO LOBBY FOR A CHANGE IN THE IRS's TREATMENT OF STAKING REWARDS FOR SOLO STAKERS.**

*Note: I'm not a member of the PoS Alliance and not a tax lawyer or CPA, just a random dude who pays his taxes and truly believes in decentralization and the transformational potential of the Ethereum network.*

<summary>Ecosystem: u/vvpan quells our expectations on the current state of rollups and their future development timeline</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10t6kdg/daily_general_discussion_february_4_2023/j79lvy8/)

I've been known to come off kind of negative about the state of roll-ups. I do think that long-term they are the absolute best way to scale blockchains. Justin Drake the other day blew the minds of all participants of Bankless Bullcase for Ethereum by saying that the synchronous composability between zk rollups is such that different different rollups can combine their liquidity into a single pool and that Danksharding does not break that composability. Yet the key is *long-term.* Optimism, the oldest optimistic rollup, has not yet gotten to fraud proofs and neither has Arbitrum. And ZK is a much much more complex technology that requires highly skilled mathematically skilled developers to implement and will roll out slower at least because there is much more potential for bugs (although Justin Drake said Ethereum research team recently figured out how to add "training wheels" to a rollup). I think [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1621573597566468096) from Scroll zkEVM account is telling about where we are.  
I am not saying this to be a downer, but to say that we have to have realistic expectations. Big announcements for "mainnet" of this or that rollup or some new improvement to one are galore and sometimes I feel like they are borderline disingenuous. I understand their teams - they reach significant personal milestones and they want to share. But a secure decentralized general-puprose rollup of any kind seems to be behind the horizon for now.

<summary>Analysis: u/nikola_j shares DeFi Saver's latest features</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10u5d4l/daily_general_discussion_february_5_2023/j7aqft0/)

Hey fellas, wanted to share something we put together recently at defi saver - a dedicated page for various leveraged ETH staking options that you can check out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking)

We added support for both Aave v3 and the new WETH-based deployment of Compound v3 in the past two weeks and both offered new interesting options for leveraging LSDs vs ETH for amplified staking yield, so we thought this made sense.

For now you can find different (w)stETH/ETH options across Aave v2, v3 and CompV3-WETH in there, as well as the cbETH/ETH combo available in Compound (which is at net negative yield atm because of high pool utilisation).

Next: we'll have a new Morpho-Aave integration live, and after that we expect to see rETH added to Aave v3 on the mainnet \*and\* wstETH added to Aave v3 on Optimism. So you can definitely expect to see a growing number of options there in the coming weeks and months.

Btw, if you check it out, we'd love to hear what else we could add, so please don't hesitate. I also posted an alternative rundown on this on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) / [nitter](https://nitter.net/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) (nitter isn't loading this for me atm, did twitter already kill it? :/)

Maybe some hope afterall for us Gemini Earn users. [u/jtnichol](https://reddit.com/u/jtnichol)

Email from Gemini:

Hi there,

Today, Gemini reached an agreement in principle with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis), Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG), and other creditors on a plan that provides a path for Earn users to recover their assets. This agreement was announced in Bankruptcy Court today.

This plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets for all Genesis creditors. In addition, Gemini will be contributing up to $100 million more for Earn users as part of the plan, further demonstrating Gemini‚Äôs continued commitment to helping Earn users achieve a full recovery.

We have been working around the clock since November 16, 2022 to reach this milestone. We greatly appreciate your support and patience during this time. It has allowed us to maximize our efforts on your behalf. There is still much work to be done to complete this process, including further due diligence of Genesis financials and judicial approval of this plan, but we are confident that we now have a framework in place to execute on. Thank you for putting your trust in us during this challenging time.

We will continue to update you on how to participate in the recovery, key dates, information, and milestones as they unfold on the Earn status page.

Onward and Upward,

Team Gemini

<summary>Random: u/theethmeister The current moment feels like we are caught in a wave of uncertainty</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10woz0p/daily_general_discussion_february_8_2023/j7omifz/)

I hope everyone has a great day. The current moment feels like we are caught in a wave of uncertainty due to economic and political constraints and factors but that does not mean you should lose faith in the premise of a decentralized monetary system or this community. 

The doldrums of the crab should not deter you from your belief that ETH  is the best technological investment at this time. This can obviously change in the future due to a new cryptocurrency/blockchain displacing ETH or quantum technology rendering our keys worthless. However it is my belief we are still on the ground floor of an emerging asset class. I remember when I used to tell my school friends to connect with me online but they didn't even have internet access because they were lacking dial up modems on their Windows 95 desktops. I found so many great communities online and made a great many number of friends on the "world wide web" before it became so commonplace as it is now. In the end I honestly do not know if the internet has been a net positive in light of the harmful effects of social media and the ease of scamming.

Sorry for the rambling, but my point is Ethereum and Ethfinance remind me of those mid to late 90s internet moments, which leads me to think that $10k USD is a ridiculously low valuation after withdrawals are enabled. The current period is in the Web 1 phase (Angelfire, Xanga, Yahoo Mail) and not even comparable to Web 2.0. We need some hopium so I am going to prognosticate a low of $15k USD in 2025. Buy now and sell never.

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the scam that took out a fellow EthFinancier</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10lkzyb/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2023/j5yw3vm/)

Today we will be investigating the scam that took advantage of our friend who came here looking for help yesterday. My inital intent was to remove this campaign from the internet.

Though, as my investigation progressed, I became more and more conscious of the CFAA. I would not discourage anyone who understands the implications from picking up where I left off.

**The Scam**

Loading the domain in your browser will instantly prompt MetaMask to connect. Doing so leads to a fake DEX. You are given a 6 digit ‚ÄòID‚Äô that is displayed on the front page. Below is an example of one of their scam pages.

<https://imgur.com/Wy5NPSb>

This is all over the place. USDT-ERC20, output in ETC. They provide various addresses to deposit your funds. At least one of the addresses provided does not even have an ETH balance ‚Äì without any gas money, these fraudsters were never planning to return any deposits.

I clicked on the button that was a head with headphones, presumably the support button.

<https://imgur.com/s2V6PAW>

You can ‚ÄòEmall‚Äô them at the displayed email address. Visiting the above domain in chrome showed the exact same front end as the scam we‚Äôre dealing with.

Frighteningly, they want you to ‚Äòauthenticate‚Äô.

<https://imgur.com/B9nXvHN>

They ask for your name and email address. Infinitely worse, they want pictures of any forms of your identification, as can be seen below.

<https://imgur.com/iJpMGIj>

Anyone who has completed this form should consider their identity stolen, and contact the appropriate authorities.

**Offense**

To begin to gain some understanding of a website, using ‚Äòview page source‚Äô in your browser is an extremely effective tool.

<https://imgur.com/8q39ows>

The highlighted text is Simplified Chinese for ‚Äòpage loaded‚Äô. *Quite* interesting.

As an attacker, this file upload form offers a massive attack surface. Of course, an experienced intruder knows what to do here.

But for any ethfinanciers who would like to learn more about this, here are some resources [1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)[2](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)[3](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/unrestricted-file-upload-testing/) or just ask ya boi.

When running a [black box](https://brightsec.com/blog/black-box-penetration-testing/) web application security test, /robots.txt is a critical file to access. This file is used by servers to request that web crawlers such as google not access/archive the list of URLs within the file.

As you might imagine, these often times contain URLs of relative importance. Whether crawlers choose to obey is completely up to them both technically, and legally(not legal advice).

The requested /robots.txt did not directly return any confidential files or directories. Though, it resulted in a fairly signficant information leak.

<https://imgur.com/eJwEEWq>

I unfortunately did not think to translate that Chinese text to English. Do we have any Chinese speaking ethfinanciers who can help out?

Notice that this error leaks a number of file paths on this server.

At the bottom we see that the server uses ThinkPHP 3.2.0, which happens to be vulnerable to a high severity issue.

<https://imgur.com/3l8C9Tf>

I will not fix the URL provided in the description to fit this target simply for the safety of those who do not know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. Be very careful before landing yourself in federal prison.

When learning to attack a system, one thing that has to be reinforced is the idea of enumeration. I cannot find a link to an article that accurately articulates what I wish to convey. I would describe it is as the art of testing ideas, taking notes of oddities, and learning everything you can about your target system.

Here‚Äôs an example. Screenshots were not taken, but I found that files requested that lack the the extension ‚Äò.php‚Äô resulted in the same error shown in /robots.txt. Is it a vulnerability? No. Is it worth noting if you wish to gain a thorough understanding of your target? Yes.

I've seen *lots* of examples of security researchers bringing down scam websites without facing prosecution, but a number of things made me hesitant in this case.

<https://imgur.com/0j1UzE0>

The true ip address of the scammers is protected by Cloudflare. Finding the ip address of servers behind Cloudflare is an eternal challenge for attackers.

<https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/> seems to be extremely comprehensive and up to date. I tried every technqiue short of signing up for a service that requires an API key. No results, the following provides a fair explanation for that.

<https://imgur.com/iK54QDk>

As [/u/REALJohnBMacLemore](https://reddit.com/u/REALJohnBMacLemore) previously noted, the website was only created a few months ago. Thats always suspicious. What about the domain listed as the support email address?

<https://imgur.com/4xC20qD>

This domain is hosted by Alibaba US. That they dont even provide an abuse contact speaks volumes.

In my brief enumeration efforts, I visisted /index.php, which redirected me to /Pc/Index/index.html.

<https://imgur.com/DDUUiAQ>

The HTML does not render properly, but this is completely different than what we were dealing with before.

<https://imgur.com/wk227MG>

At the bottom of the page we see another support email address. The highlighted text seems to show that the listed website(NOTE: not the scam domain in question) might have been a real company at some point? The registration number certainly does not comply with the new Chinese business registration numbering system, which was in full effect by 2018.

Lets use <https://whois.domaintools.com> again to find some information about this newly discovered forex exchange domain.

<https://imgur.com/2o6PP1v>

The domain name has been used for at least 16 years.

This scam seems to be masquerading as a possibly real, but defunct Chinese forex exchange. Also doubling as a crypto exchange, depending on their target.

[Attribution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/cyber-attribution-essential-component-of-incident-response-or-optional-extra/) has always been a touchy subject in the realm of cyber security, with that type of debate usually reserved for large-scale nation state attacks.

When we consider the prevalent usage of the Simplified Chinese language, a Chinese PHP framework, and Alibaba hosting, Im confident in declaring this a campaign of Chinese origin. Of course, given the lack of sophistication on the part of the scammers, and the lack of geopolitical implications, this is virtually meaningless.

Stay safe, RTPP

<summary>Community: u/DoubtStarsAreFire shares her and Logris's back story</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10n7qyq/daily_general_discussion_january_28_2023/j67f4fp/)

For those of you that are regular readers of Logris‚Äô work and do not know, Logris and I (DoubtStarsAreFire) run *Tokenomics Explained* together. We are partners in all things. Family, life, the website, and now our consulting business. In the beginning, I would minimize, qualify, and categorize all of the work that we have put into our site as, ‚Äúoh we run a blog‚Äù. Probably because when we started *Tokenomics Explained* we didn‚Äôt have a plan. Increasingly, we do, or at least ambition.

# EV Mavericks Podcast:

Listen to the [Layer Zero Podcast #4](https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/VX3ZGDe6Qwb) from the EV Mavericks to hear us talk more about *Tokenomics Explained*, Hodlercon, the Double Logris and our plans for Logris Vaults! Ping us if you'd like to join our BUIDL team at EthDenver.

I felt like we could do a better job explaining the genesis of the blog. Because if you listen we kind of stumble over the answer.

Why am I posting now? The blog has mainly been a space for Logris‚Äô writing. The main reason that I‚Äôm posting is I joined the Bankless Academy writers guild. I‚Äôll be posting content on the website for the next four weeks. I'm calling these contributions Stargazing. There were other options for locations to post my thoughts like Mirror or Medium. I really did think about posting there. But, our blog seemed like the best place. Stargazing will be my additions to ‚ÄúLogris the Blog‚Äù.

Visit [https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/) to see the whole post.

*Below is a short excerpt.*

# The Backstory

I‚Äôve always heard it said, ‚Äúwrite what you know‚Äù so for a first topic answering the question ‚ÄúHow did Tokenomics Explained start?‚Äù seems appropriate. Logris and I have been asked this exact question several times in interviews or by friends. That is usually a good sign you should write something down.

First, at heart my husband is a writer. When I met him, it wasn‚Äôt something I knew about him. I just thought he was a cute programmer boy that I was meeting to play board games. It‚Äôs taken years for me to come to the realization that he is a writer as well a programmer. I‚Äôm starting here because it gets to the heart of why we began this venture. He became interested in crypto because it combined his interests of computer science, game theory, and economics. Just like you should write about what you know, you should invest in what you know. Back in 2017, most of the social media about crypto was on reddit. This eventually led him to ethtrader and from there to ethfinance. Me, I was along for the ride. He would talk at me about crypto and I would blink at him and say, ‚Äúthose were words‚Äù.

I watched him ride the bull market of 2017 and then the crash. He survived the crypto winter. Eventually the food coin craze hit. All the while, Logris was riding the waves and I was following along or lurking in reddit parlance. Based on my experience and observations in my own house, I thought everyone was spending hours reading, researching, and writing their posts. Over the years, I have learned differently. Thank you reddit shit posters for disabusing me of this notion.

So why did we choose to make a website? In short, it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs fault. Ever since Logris started investing in crypto in 2017, he was a daily visitor and poster to the subreddit. As you know, all the fun in ethfinance takes place in the Daily Discussion Thread. Over the years Logris had made some stellar posts‚Ä¶ in the daily. But, Google doesn‚Äôt index the daily. Top level posts are often reserved for announcements from protocols, highly regarded posts from the daily, or noobs that don‚Äôt know any better.

Why is this important to the story?

TLDR: It‚Äôs all because of Google‚Äôs SEO.

>**For example:** At some point in the past, you may have googled about a question you had. In the search results, there may have been a reddit post with the same question. You'd click the link and find yourself directed to a subreddit about the topic, where knowledgeable people may have already responded to your exact or similar question.

**Since most of the posts on ethfinance happen in the daily thread and not at the top level** (as in the example), **this content is invisible to Google.**

Logris was amassing a treasure trove of content and often wanted to cite it when it became relevant again. This became more pertinent when he came up with the idea for the Double Logris. People started asking about it and wanting to read more about it. His ideas, content, and discussions were disappearing into the ether as it were. So, he started using Google drive to keep track for referral, which was ridiculous. To save time and just generally make the world a better place we decided to create a repository for his writings by making this site.

<summary>Analysis: u/Defacticool just finished studying law and discusses how DAOs fit in existing legal framework</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10o0h5d/daily_general_discussion_january_29_2023/j6dqs2n/)

Hope this is an acceptable place to ask some questions both for the mods and regulars here. 

Last spring I graduated from law school (here in sweden, my degree is an analogue to an LMM) and I wrote my "final paper" on DAO and defi, from a company law and securities law perspective. 

I recently saw and read that paper from /u/Pbrody (hope that's correct) and EY about how the "best" firm classification for DAO's are as Co-operatives. 

And so I thought maybe there would be some interest to see my own research that I spent 6 months on. (Tldr of my conclusion: "Proper" DAOs don't fit any current, swedish, firm classifications and are unable to fit in one even if they wanted to, and securities law is unable to in any way sanction or interactive with fully autonomous swapping protocols such as Uniswap)

So my questions are: 

- Would there be any interest if I posted my paper here? 
- would the mods be alright with me posting it here?
- and finally, does anyone know of a good and accessible site where I could upload my paper and those interested could read/download it? Preferably one where I don't have to dox myself. 

Cheers! I Love this community.

Edit: Thought I should add, I wrote it in english.

Editwo: Just posted it in today's daily: https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10oudh1/daily_general_discussion_january_30_2023/j6iwia0/

In yesterday's daily I asked about interest for sharing my "final exam paper" from when I graduated law school last year. (After looking into it further, I believe the american term for it is something like "masters research paper") 

I got way greater of a response than I anticipated so I'll be sharing it with you in this comment! I hope a mediafire link is allowed. 

Just some heads up that the version I'm linking you isn't the final handed-in version but the penultimate version so there will be some grammatical and spelling errors but nothing that should affect the content. This is so I don't run afoul of any academic policies about sharing examinated material through the wrong channels. (Should be fine, but don't wanna risk it) 

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/tyd530ryrjljst2/DAO_and_DEFI_legal_analysis.pdf/file>

If anyone has any constructive thoughts I genuinely would love to hear them! 

In a comment in response to this one I'll be posting the "Final Remarks" portion, for those that just wants my final take and don't care to trudge through the rest.

<summary>Random: u/LogrisTheBard discusses the crypto education gap</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2023/j6ly502/)

So my wife is working on a post this week on web3 education. On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It's a lot of replicated effort and unless it's paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it's having no impact. On the other end there's highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like /u/liberosist writes. These are written for the *dozens* of us living at the edge of the frontier. In the middle is a desert of content. Once you get past that entry level content you get chucked into places like /r/cryptocurrency and good luck to you. You're excited by the potential of what you learnt in the entry level content but you're not yet proficient enough to spot the scams. Everyone is passionately shilling you something and telling you why it's the next great thing that's going to kill Ethereum etc. Basically, you're someone else's exit liquidity.

It takes a full market cycle to wisen up. By the time you transition from tourist to settler you've probably lost 90% of your investment into altcoins. Many don't stick around after that and those who leave form a moat of resentment in front of the Rabbit Hole. The abrupt cliff of learning material once you have a Metamask wallet loaded with some ETH is doing a disservice to our space. It's suddenly a space with no map and no Sherpa and you weren't taught spelunking. It's ultimately discouraging people from joining this space and slowing down the adoption of one of the most promising technologies humanity has ever produced.

In the last year I've written a bit more for this entry +1 skill level and a bit less on the frontier but anything I write tends to come off more as entry +3 regardless of my intent or else I don't find it interesting enough to write. My wife is better than me in this regard so I hope web3 does find a space for her to be an educator here. Anything else is a disservice to *humanity*.

<summary>Random: u/Liberosist is cautious not to get overly bullish about long-term ETH issuance trends</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10qm414/daily_general_discussion_february_1_2023/j6r7sq6/)

As [u/15kisFUD](https://reddit.com/u/15kisFUD) [pointed out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6m5xo7/), the sentiment currently is neutral-ish, so it's a good time to talk about things that everyone will laugh at in bull times or be depressed over in bear times. Now, both u/No_Fix_1183 and I got a ton of backlash (or as NoFix says, "[got crucified](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6q5foj/)") over the last couple of days for broaching the inevitability of secular bear market for emerging markets, and how they typically happen on narratives years before actual adoption - but there's at least a few people now who are still interested. No one will listen when the bull comes around, so this is our chance. So, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about a different topic.

When the ponzis spin back up and the mania happens, the ultrasoundmoney cult will be unbearably loud and you'll see all sorts of absurd projections around the burn, deflation and such. Some of you may remember I was skeptical of the numbers being thrown around in 2021 (having myself fallen for them earlier in 2020) - and even had a little debate with Justin Drake here. It may seem absurd now, but numbers like 20%-70% staking APR, 5% deflation were widely accepted, based off clearly unsustainable usage.

Instead, it would be prudent to form a base case now, and use those numbers instead in the future. The first observation you'll see that in ETH terms, total transaction fees outside of manias are [actually relatively constant](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) \- which is a big narrative violation of the up-only rhetoric you saw in 2021 and will see again in the next bull. (Yes, the mechanisms have changed since EIP-1559, but it's in the same order of magnitude) \[PS, edit: other data sources like Coin Metrics do account for EIP-1559; however, as I mentioned originally, it's in the same order of magnitude\] The $ tx fees are still going up, of course, with a larger economy and higher ETH price. But remember - burn rates, staking rates, MEV are all denominated in ETH, so it doesn't matter.

It's very likely the type of fees in 2020 (when it peaked) and 2021 will never be seen again - for the simple fact that there's orders of magnitude more blockspace available across L2s and alt-L1s - and even more coming with EIP-4844. Nevertheless, the "premium" ponzis and "luxury" status symbol type NFTs will always be on L1 - so we'll definitely see huge increases in gas prices.

Anyway, getting back to the base case, and what actual sustainable revenue looks like - as mentioned above, it has been relative constant over the years. This comes with the implication that, actually, staking rewards are going to be relatively constant - in the \~1.5%-2.5% range for priority fees + \~1% range for MEV. Meanwhile, issuance is going to reduce over time, so we can safely conclude the long-term staking rewards are going to be somewhere in the \~5% range. Coincidentally, at current staking rate, we should expect very mild deflation, but as more is staked this will revert back to mild inflation.

Now, some will argue "but there are whole new usecases that will come online". Sure, and fees will go up over time in $ times, but as 7 years of data suggests, not in ETH terms. Also, as mentioned above, there's orders of magnitude more space available on L2s going forward, who will pay relatively negligible fees to L1 post EIP-4844 as there'll be a dedicated data fee market. So why won't L1 fees collapse? Because L1 will remain the premiere execution layer - even the perfect L2 won't be quite as secure and Lindy, and the venue for high-value settlements for the foreseeable future.

Tl;dr: staking rewards are likely going to remain the \~5% APR range long term and inflation will probably tend towards being mildly positive, so when you see absurd projections based on unsustainable mania burns during the bull - remain resolute and sell your ETH to those who are aping in thinking 10%-20% yields and 2% deflation is sustainable.

My final "do it while neutral sentiment lasts" rant - I've used the phrase "markets are forward-looking" often. Based on the backlash I've received in the last few days, I sense that people misunderstand it as meaning "investors can predict the future". It's kind of the opposite - in the bull market people will price in a utopia that may be years away; likewise in a bear market people will price in the doom. We have seen this multiple times in crypto. But what we (arguably) haven't seen is a secular peak where the wider market with a majority of institutions/HNWIs will price in a mature Ethereum 5-10 years from now. It's very wrong to think ETH price is up-only until "Ethereum's vision is delivered and there is mass adoption" - markets have never worked like that, especially emerging markets. There are countless examples to look at with very few exceptions - but the most obvious and relevant one to study is, of course, the dot-com bubble. They priced in the final form of the internet way back in 2000, which took till the 2010s to actually deliver - and yes, many internet companies took 10 years to revisit their 2000 highs. Now, some will argue that Ethereum is not a company - but that doesn't matter, ETH's value is derived by market forces, and crypto markets follow the same behaviour.

<summary>Community: u/alexiskef has an ELI5 for the Ethereum KZG ceremony</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10fu4px/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2023/j4zrfmk/)

Hey friends! As you might have noticed from the many comment threads these past 2-3 days, the Ethereum Foundation has been running (since the beginning of this week and for approximately two more months) something called the [KZG Ceremony](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/). 

**MY** noob-friendly eli5 is that this super-easy-to-participate and open-to-everyone ceremony will contribute (via super-fancy-behind-the-scene math) the necessary randomness for the trust assumptions of the upcoming EIP4844, aka ProtoDanksharding.

(The official explanation is: "*This ceremony, sometimes called a "Trusted Setup", will generate a structured reference string (SRS) which is needed for the commitments to work. An SRS is secure as long as at least one participant in the ceremony successfully conceals their secret.")*

The website of the Ceremony has plenty of information on all things ceremony, however, I wanted to share with you all an üéßüî• [excellent podcast episode](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/478) üî•üéß with a conversation between Carl Beekhuizen & Trenton Van Epps from the Ethereum Foundation and the host of [Epicenter.tv](https://Epicenter.tv), Friederike Ernst.

The topics the three of them touch on, are:

* Danksharding and scaling Ethereum
* Data BLOBs and data availability
* KZG ceremony
* How trusted setups evolved
* KZG commitment requirements
* How trust is ensured
* Combining randomness
* How storing secrets is prevented
* General contribution details
* Special contributions
* Quantum vulnerability
* General EIP-4844 timeline

I certainly do not understand 99% of the math, but this conversation really helped me understand the basic ideas behind the whole process! Enjoy!

<summary>Random: u/Bob-Rossi is familiarizing themselves with Linux for the start of their staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10gp4if/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2023/j56ezbm/)

Public accountability update on my staking journey w/ u/benido2030

After an appreciated pep-talk last week, I took a few hours this week to continue to familiarize myself with Linux. Namely the terminal - found a random YouTube video to just follow along with and type through some basic commands. I think this has been helpful so far because my first attempt at all this I just jumped into a staking guide with literal zero understanding what was going on with the terminal. It was an unnecessary stressor knowing one deviation from a guide and I'm screwed.

I am hoping to get a little more familiar with Linux in general before I go further. So if anyone has ideas / videos of things that helped them when they were starting I'd love to see them. I noticed the [CoinCashew Guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node) has a lot of security best practice type things I need to familiar myself with, so may start focusing on that stuff. 

If anyone cares (and to in general share back links myself) someone here gave me this link (sorry, it was awhile ago) --- [https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) --- which was a nice starter read and this was the video I followed along with --- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA) --- which had a lot of similiar stuff but was easy to follow in video. Both super basic, but I can't stress enough how much of a newbie I am with Linux... so it was a comfy start. 

I'd also like to keep this quasi-weekly thing going, so if anyone else is trying going down their staking journey feel free to jump in.

<summary>Analysis: u/LogrisTheBard discusses NFT tickets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10icjgc/daily_general_discussion_january_22_2023/j5fm373/)

I think the form of NFTs ripe for the next bull cycle will be different. Just as web2 innovated on web1 by adding interactivity, I think we‚Äôll see the same occur for the next wave of NFT‚Äôs. Gone will be the hype for profile pictures and we'll transition towards NFTs with steady demand and which produce revenue streams.

I don't think the infrastructure will be there next bull market for real world asset NFTs like car or house deeds. Governments already have systems for those and even if it would reduce their costs that isn't a metric they are optimizing for. So, I'm looking at informatic use cases of the blockchain that can remain in the digital realm to the point of delivery.

Chief among these are live events or NFT ticketing. Live events occur on a regular basis and the total addressable market cap here makes the art market blush. I particularly like this use case because it serves everyone better except the existing parasitic middlemen.

Just from a technical feature perspective, NFTs provide a provenance trail. If you gate NFT transfers to KYC'd customers then the venues which switch to this system can actually know who attended their events. This is obviously useful information which is lost now and it enables entirely new pathways to engagement between performers and attendees. For example there could be exclusive ticket sale rounds to whitelisted addresses based on previous event attendance.

Additionally there are trust and corruption issues with current ticketing approaches such as corrupt release mechanisms and opaque service charge fees. At the very least having the sale logic on the blockchain can add transparency and equal access to the process. Protocols like POAP and Funfair have already demonstrated provably fair lottery mechanisms when demand outstrips supply. Alternatively more market-like initial auction systems have been demonstrated by newer tokens like Gearbox which used [0xCider](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87). Blockchains are demonstrably excellent at executing a provably fair, transparent process.

As to fees, a lot of the service fee charged by Ticketmaster actually goes to [middlemen or the venue](https://thehustle.co/the-sneaky-economics-of-ticketmaster/). It's how they were able to grow to their current size: they stopped treating the attendee as the customer. There is a market opportunity here to reduce Ticketmaster's cut of the fees though. That is still substantial. Ticketmaster's revenue was [$12.3B in 2022](https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/live-nation-ticketmasters-record-earnings-come-at-the-expense-of-fans-artists-and-venue-owners/). It's a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi mullet and we're already seeing it start to happen even from Ticketmaster themselves[[1]](https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass)[[2]](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/)[[3]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/). This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.

Finally, unlike a normal ticket stub or plain digital record an NFT ticket can be associated with extra metadata (even after the event). A system like Ticketmaster could add some type of history system so you can view a collection of your previous events and event highlight reels for each but they haven't in 20 years. By contrast, this is much more normal for NFTs already. Integrate this into a digital picture frame and you can have a place on superfan's wall that cycles through highlights of the favorite games they've attended or that lets them build a digital gallery in something like Decentraland and compete with other fans.

So, there's an opportunity here to improve the status quo for venues, performers, and attendees and the only one who stands to lose is a generally reviled middleman. I don't think we'll get as much push-back from the consumers here as we'll see from Gamefi. However, stuff will need to be built.

The UX for buying tickets needs to be tailored to buying tickets. Customers need to see the layout of the venue for the seats being sold, be shown the context of the event, and be offered pathways to deeper engagement with that event‚Äôs community. All of these are UI centric changes that don‚Äôt require much contract code and are ripe for innovation. Adjacent to the chain, the NFT metadata stored on IPFS could be standardized for easier integration into navigation and viewing software.

Assuming devnets run for another month, and then the two public testnets are spaced 3 weeks apart, that would put end March Shanghai. If devnets are run for two weeks and then the two public testnets each spaced two weeks apart, Shanghai date would be early March. Either way Shanghai in March seems increasingly likely (Just my own guessing, nothing official from the core devs on a date yet)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10jyo68/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2023/j5quguk/)

I'm a long time hodler. At the moment I have most of my ETH staked with CB. With withdrawals coming soon. I figured now is a good time to explore solo staking. Since I'm not tech savvy. I feel solo staking is a little out of my comfort zone. I looked into using dapenode and rocketpool. After looking at tons of videos and guides. I decided to try the rocketpool route. I followed this guys YouTube video. 

<https://youtu.be/-o3IV3AClw8>

I was able to follow along pretty good and now I'm officially running a node on rocketpools testnet. I'm surprised it's actually working. With that said. I feel like I'm missing so much understanding of what is really happening with my node. All I know is I followed a bunch of copy and paste code into the terminal and got it to work. Did I secure my device enough? Did I set up ssh that I have no idea how to use? Is my firewall setup? What is my computer going to do when I lose power? At this moment I'm a very dangerous eth staker. There's so much I need to learn in order to trust myself with staking real eth. I wish there was some kind of staking class I could attend. I'm going to keep learning as much as I can until withdrawals are enabled. Once that happens my eth will go back to the safety of my hardware wallet until I feel 100% comfortable staking on my own. Thanks to everyone of you that help guys/gals like myself. Cheers.

<summary>Random: u/Tricky_Troll decides now is a good time to reflect on the good, the bad and the ugly of how he played the last bull market</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40rrwq/)

**Disclaimer: This is a long-winded reflective post. Skip to the end if you would prefer a TL;DR.**

Now is the perfect time to reflect on your own personal wins and regrets from the bull market just gone. It's quiet, fundamentals are showing strong with Ethereum's strength above $1,000 and a bottom feels like it may have formed. Don't @ me if I jinxed it.

Personally, I'd give myself a 5/10. Overall I did ok.

**The Good:**

My early bull run strategy was good. I sold the last of my Bitcoin after its initial run to $30K/40K as the first part of taking profits. I splashed out on a couple of things I'd been wanting for a while and I diversified into to physical assets as well as leaving some aside for paying tax (just not quite enough in the end üôÉ). Also, losses which will be covered in "The Ugly" were kept to a responsible (enough) % of my stack and I did not double down or try to gamble back shitcoin losses. Losses were accepted and rational portfolio allocations were stuck to. Once the shitcoins went to Goblintown, my precious ETH stack was left untouched.

Finally, I managed to hit my 32 ETH target and run a solo validator node. It was a lot of learning for me but solo staking is very satisfying and worth the effort.

**The Less Good:**

I sold all of my shitcoins and was full ETH by the time the bear market kicked in to 5th gear. This allowed me to fund quitting my job temporarily to go to Hodlercon and do a long delayed trip with my family in the UK. I should have sold these earlier but I managed to shake these bags before we entered Goblintown.

**The Bad:**

I had a cash out plan and my target was not hit as I was hoping. My cash out plan evolved after an event I will cover in the next section. The bad thing is that part of my target was hit and I did nothing about it.

**The Ugly:**

35% of my stack was lost to shitcoins in 2020 and DeFi coins in 2021. Overconfidence from picking out Chainlink in the 2018 bear and then selling the top in late 2019/early 2020 contributed to this greatly. It was a humbling experience but also, unfortunately this loss of 35% of my stack was the reason why my cash out target was not hit. I had a set $ amount I wanted to sell (which would be hit at around a $4.5K ETH) or when a bunch of my favourite indicators on <https://www.LookIntoBitcoin.com> flashed sell. After losing the 35%, the cash out amount crept up since I had less ETH to sell (it went up to about a $9K ETH). Due to the elongated nature of the late bull run, less than half of the sell indicators I was following flashed sell. I tried to time the peak too close. As a result, the peak I expected never came and I never sold when I should have.

**Learnings:**

So what have I learned and what can you learn from me? My first piece of advice is never to double down to re-coup losses. After I lost my shitcoin stack I was tempted to double down and I had other coins lined up. But guess what, those coins did terribly. I would have only lost more ETH and wouldn't be solo staking today. Set aside a portion of your stack to leave invested in ETH for the long run. Do not waver from this allocation. If you find that hard, maybe staking is for you. A 16 ETH rETH minipool or 32 ETH solo node cannot be partially sold. It's a great way to keep assets locked in for your long term investment thesis, also earn a yield and of course help to decentralise Ethereum!

Secondly, I think it's important to stick to a cash out plan. Furthermore, I think laddering out is better too. It's easy to want to hit a target but this market is too unpredictable to rely on such a hit or miss strategy. Everyone is different, so I don't think this strategy suits everyone but if you are someone with a cash out plan, I'd recommend sticking to it and I'd also recommend having multiple targets over a single cash out price.

My final piece of advice is to stay humble and stay cautious. Now that I have experienced the feeling of winning a big bet on one of just 2 altcoins to go on a big run up last bear market and subsequently thinking I'm a genius and can do it again, I see this attitude everywhere. Look at Do Kwon or any of the has beens last bull run. They think they can make a comeback and are trying to build up their redemption arcs. They got lucky. Then they got overconfident and greedy. Then the market turned and their shenanigans that they thought was proof they were geniuses revealed that they really aren't any better than the rest of us. In fact, they're worse. At least I kept my losses limited and didn't keep leveraging up. Keeping my bullishness and self-confidence in check is the only reason I didn't lose it all. There were definitely points where I wanted to go all in on my shitcoins but I didn't because I knew it was irresponsible.

Anyway, I apologise for the long-winded nature of this post. I don't really have the time today to flesh it out into a nice concise ordered write up. I guess I'll leave you with a TL;DR instead.

TL;DR:

- Stay humble. Watch out for the trap of over-confidence after you make a smart investment or two thinking you can do it again. Chances are you can't.
- Keep responsible allocations. I'd have lost it all had I not resisted the urge to double down in an effort to recoup losses. Running a staking node can help with this.
- I recommend cash out plans and sticking to them. Furthermore, laddered cash out plans help protect against uncertainty. My all or nothing plan has left me frustrated and short on liquidity in this bear.

<summary>OPSEC: u/696_eth reminds us of some tips to keep our crypto assets safe and secure</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40d0kx/)

**hardware wallet is a MUST** if you have more than $2k in crypto and you are not cashing that out right now and leaving.

**Transfer your valuable NFTs from hot/burner to COLD (hardware) wallet**. While Gas is still quite cheap at night US time/morning EU time. You can bundle (x20 items) thru OS. Yes, you might end up paying like 0.01-0.02e per transfer.

Another good practice is to use revoke . cash 's application and also remove permissions from time to time.

I know to most people it's a given but I keep seeing people getting hacked here and there and I'd rather remind again. And your not garbage NFTs are valuable to! so remember that. Trust me, it might suck and feel like unnecessary investment and use of money transferring assets but you'd be happy you still have all your stuff cause for non-hardware wallets it's not IF it's WHEN you'll lose it all so act accordingly.

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the Revoke.Cash extension and reveals some privacy concerns</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10amvdl/daily_general_discussion_january_13_2023/j47tn1w/)

The following will serve as an *extremely* abbreviated version of my research into the revoke.cash browser extension, focusing as narrowly on privacy as I can.

Obviously we're taking a different direction here, as this is clearly not a wallet. However, I think its fair to say that this one is particularly relevant to my ethfinanciers.

Revoke.cash was downloaded directly from the chrome [webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revokecash-web3-scam-prot/nmniboccheadcclilkfkonokbcoceced?hl=en)

<https://imgur.com/CRRvUfJ>

Starting off, the extension's privacy tab on the chrome webstore page looks good. No data collection is always good to see.

<https://imgur.com/qw2xLIY>

Immediately upon installation we see this POST request to Amplitude, an analytics platform.

There are a few identifiers, including 'user_id', 'device_id', 'session_id', and 'insert_id'. Not so great.

And the keen reader may notice the fields 'initial_referrer', and 'initial_referring_domain'. The values here are 'EMPTY', but I take massive issue with this in the case that they are ever used to collect that data.

If they're going to be collecting your [referer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) header, the least they could do is misspell it as the HTTP spec does haha.

I will go into how the extension functions in a more extensive revision, which will include a review of some crypto scams, and a taste of malware analysis.

But this single request to Amplitude got me wondering what happens when I visit <https://revoke.cash> using my everyday use firefox installation, with only uBlock Origin and NoScript enabled.

<https://imgur.com/xtgQ1KM>

Here we see a request to hxxps://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com/latest.js - An obvious tracker, BOOM instantly killed by NoScript

Worth noting that I did not see a request to this domain when using the extension.

<https://imgur.com/O01Qczo>

Here we see a javascript file trying attempting to force my browser to generate POST requests to 127.0.0.1:8545

Either way, killed by NoScript.

Maybe theres some extension functionality that its trying to interact with?

<https://imgur.com/jwoL55B>

On the bottom right of the page you can see those connections are refused, even with the extension in use. Odd.

<https://imgur.com/dXONMEH>

Back to firefox, we see a request to amplitude just as generated by the extension. However, this time uBlock killed that attempt.

I keep harping on the fact that by installing extensions, you allow them to completely bypass protections such as NoScript and uBlock Origin.

Be careful out there, folks

gm gentlemen,

a quick reminder about the KZG ceremony: <https://ceremony.ethereum.org/>

You can help by contributing your randomness to the whole thing. The more people participate the better, as it only takes one honest person to make the whole thing a success.

It's really easy and fast to do. All you need is an Ethereum wallet address with more than 3 transfers, and then it's just writing some random text and signing a bunch of messages and you're already done. The whole process takes <2 minutes.

You'll get a POAP too, so get going and help secure & scale Ethereum! This will be used for the danksharding implementation later on.

> To make an analogy, your posts about security analysis, and potentially teaching us to do those kinds of investigations ourselves, play the same role in the broader ecosystem that fraud proofs do on optimistic rollups. If you start with a trusted system, and the system is honest, then all is well and good, but if they're not honest, and nobody is checking on them, then they can get away with anything. For such a system to become trustless, you need a sufficient number of capable fraud-checkers who are checking often enough such that there's a near-certainty someone would catch malfeasance if it were present. The more people capable of checking ecosystem tools to see if they're doing bad things, the more trustless the ecosystem becomes. It's really crucial

- [/u/interweaver](https://reddit.com/u/interweaver) on EVM discord

Beautifully put. To this end, I will be putting together a guide detailing exactly the steps I have been taking, along with resources, and assistance wherever needed. The vast majority of the process is non-technical, just critical thinking with an almost cynical mindset haha.

I previously announced that I will be releasing a more in-depth review of revoke.cash, where this extension will also be used as we explore a variety of interesting crypto scams.

If you're interested in learning more about infosec in a very easy to digest fashion, I would recommend checking that out when it is released.

I have also promised an analysis of [Fire](https://www.joinfire.xyz/).

No commitment to any particular order can be made, but these are all on my plate.

This is last call for requests, before I leave this up to the community to continue.

<summary>Random: u/davidahoffman shares his perspective on recent criticisms of Bankless</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10cc78w/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2023/j4fzd5q/)

Hey Fam

There was a comment a few days ago in the daily about me tweeting about JPEGs, and also the frequent ‚ÄúBankless has too many ads!‚Äù Take

I typed out a pretty thorough response, as it‚Äôs stuff I hear a lot and also I think is shortsighted. Since the comment was 3 days ago, it‚Äôs buried to the depths of Reddit, so I wanted to draw attention to it here:

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2023/j4d8cqf/>

Would love y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts / feedback.

Love you guys

<summary>Community: u/Spacesider shares his staking experience and tips for anyone else experiencing similar issues</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10cc78w/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2023/j4frjwo/)

So a little something regarding how my staking experience is going.

Prior to the merge I was running Geth on one SSD and Lighthouse on another SSD.

My attestation performance was fairly good, consistently around 97-98%. Back then you didn't rely on the execution client for attesting, just for block proposals, so it wasn't a huge deal if it couldn't keep up.

Coming up to the merge I moved away from Geth and installed Nethermind on the same drive as Lighthouse, and on the other drive installed Teku-Besu (As a fallback pair).

Now with both a consensus client and execution client on the same SSD, and an execution being a requirement, it can't quite keep up. Attestation performance is averaging around 93-94% and I am seeing the occasional message pop up in my logs stating that the execution engine is not in sync.

I've been putting off addressing this for the longest time... But I figure better now than never!

I've ordered an NVMe that has 10x the read/write speeds and 10x the IOPS of the current SSD's I have. Hopefully in the next week I will get it and install it and move the primary pair (Lighthouse-Nethermind) across.

If anyone else has been getting poor attestation performance, this may be something to look into.

<summary>Random: u/benido2030 shares their learnings from 2022</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10d6prc/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2023/j4ktvza/)

I wrote a long post about my [learnings](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rpgcip/daily_general_discussion_december_27_2021/hq4yyqn/) at the end of 2021. That was (in hindsight) after we had peaked and I think it's just reasonable to update that post and include my 2022 learnings.

1. **Don't invest in last cycles coins** - Still very valid, and probably even more important now that we might be on the verge of recovering and potentially starting a new cycle.
1. **Understand the narrative** - This one is tricky. I think when I wrote this in 2021 I thought by just understanding the narrative and being early you will print. True is: narratives are important, but most likely (at least for me) only really relevant in a bull market. Or the other way around: Narratives are nice in bear market, but that doesn't mean they will safe you. E.g. There was a "real yield" season and GMX did hold pretty nicely, but it's probably an exception. Other narratives didn't help me at all. This leads to:
1. **NEW: In a bear you gotta be patient (and buy ETH)** - Now this sounds crazy, but I really think this might be the biggest learning from the last 12 months. Fade narratives in bear market. Sell last cycles coins. All of them. Don't think they will recover, because even if they do, they will lose vs ETH and you can increase your holdings if you really want to double down. I kept two tokens and let me tell you I am not happy :)
Buy ETH whenever you feel like it (longterm it's most likely a good buy). But also with ETH, be patient, history maybe doesn't repeat but it rhymes. E.g. I bought the bottom at 800$, but I also made some more buys in the other crashes at e.g. 1750. Why? Because of "FOMO", being scared it could immediately pump - which it usually doesn't in a real bear market. There is capitulation in a crash and a time based capitulation. And YES! I know that I / we don't know. And maybe next cycle is different. Still I think understanding what patience means is important.
1. **NEW: Make a bear an opportunity** - This is kind of connected to the the old 6. "Take profits". I think that's still very important: having cash on the sidelines means a crash/ dip might even have a positive side, both for your portfolio but also (and maybe more important) emotionally.
But I think I would go even further: I sold most of my alts in Feb 22. I felt I was late, didn't sell the top, bla bla. In hindsight I think that move wasn't bad at all. But I could have even shorted last cycles trash. Not in a day trading way, but as in shorting and forgetting the short. I was so impressed by some people (especially the Luna short from 100$ to 0 from that one guy that covered his short for 42cents in the end). I know I can't do that, I know he's probably one in a 1000, but I also think there is a valid way that includes shorting when you feel the bear has really arrived.
1. **You can't predict crypto short term, NEW: you can predict crypto long term** - I am more convinced than ever that this is the case and I also think that doesn't really contradict anything I have said before :) But the more important part of this is: I am sure we can predict crypto long term. I'll probably write about this soon, but e.g. "execution layers" aka "L2s" are alpha. Modular blockchains are alpha. ETH as the one global settlement layer is alpha. I can't imagine that L2 tokens won't pump. I am long OP and will try to go long with other L2 tokens, either by buying or CDP.
1. **Finance is a different world** - Still valid, still learning so much, see 4.
1. **Take profits** - I didn't take many profits apart from the alts in Feb, so I sucked here. I was too bullish. I was hoping for 10k ETH, 100k BTC etc. etc. So I am planning profit taking now. I am trying to estimate valid prices to exit certain positions, e.g. by understanding what certain prices say about my tokens, I compare them to evaluations of last cycle (example: If OP reached 20$ that would mean 80B FDV which is close to SOLs mcap last cycle - and I think that's already bullish, even if it's just 10x, compared to SOLs 100x) and try to be more realistic and less emotional when it comes to taking profits. I think I was driven by greed and euphoria last cycle and will try to change this going into 2023 and 2024.

I have some goals for the next 24-36 months and hope that reflecting on my learnings will help me to make stuff happen. Will it be as easy as I think? Def not (but I also don't think it is as easy as it might sound here!). But I want to grow, improve, challenge myself, so we need goals to measure success :)

The Brasky's Strike Back Part II

It's been over 2 months since my wife lost her job and wanted to share an update. We had both found job opportunities on separate coasts of the US and we're prepared to live apart for a few months so that we could find the income to keep the house and wait for something permanent to open up back home. I had even readied the house and advertised it for rental hoping to find a tenant while we were gone.

At the last minute we both found jobs in town...not only did she get hired with full time employment but she'll be making 20% more than her previous job!!! I had been watching our little one as my main trade is in construction and the real money is made on large industrial projects but requires traveling away from home. I had found a part time gig that worked well with our schedules but had to quit as I was going back on the road to work. I got a call right before leaving and a side hustle that I had tried to get started back in August has now just opened up...and I'll be making more than double my previous income while still playing daddy day-care!!!

The last few months have definitely been a trial and has put a lot of stress on our marriage but we came out as better spouses and better positioned than before!! We had enough savings in case of emergencies and I was prepared to start selling my sweet sweet precious ETH if things got worse. We were able to not burn through everything and our ETH stack is still intact earning rewards!! Glad I can share this my ETH fam and anyone else going through the fire. Amazed to have a spouse who can get aggressive and when the bear bites we bite back.

<summary>OPSEC: u/magnushansson shares a new paper on crypto network security</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/103r9ly/daily_general_discussion_january_5_2023/j31az1r/)

Economist Eric Budish [presents a new paper (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYFRQGwe7rI&ab_channel=EconomicsDepartment%2COxfordUniversity) showing skepticism regarding the cost of securing the Bitcoin network. The main criticism boils down to the fact that there is no trust in the system (trustless), in the sense that there is no "memory" to build up trust. A miner is only trusted by spending computing resources right now, but does not get rewarded for building up a good reputation. He argues that although this is a perfectly fine model for security, it get's very expensive. In the concluding remarks, Budish briefly discusses PoS and says that it could potentially be used in a better way.

I think his arguments for the cost of securing the Bitcoin network is interesting and probably valid (depending on what the attack looks like). People in crypto should not be arrogant and dismiss criticism, but instead try to understand all perspectives to be able to build better systems. I'm not sure how trust in a decentralized system would look, or even if it's a good idea (Any Layer0 player comments?). Also, PoS certainly have clear advantages: E.g., the cost of an attack is significantly larger, as the attacker risks losing the capital (not the case with mining). But if the capital required to secure the network needs to be way higher than the transactional value of the network, that could be an obstacle for growth. Are there any attempts to clearly work out the economics for PoS?

Edit:

Thanks for the comments and suggestions to listen to Justin Drake on this, will take a look!

I also found this quite intense twitter discussion on the subject: <https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656>

<summary>Random: u/diego-d explains why they don't really see the point in Bitcoin anymore</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/104mg1j/daily_general_discussion_january_6_2023/j39muiw/)

For the first time in my 6 years of crypto I am starting to seriously ponder: I do not actually get the 'point' of bitcoin. It's unprofitable to mine it. It pays no yield if you already have it. It doesn't protect you from inflation. It needs a steady supply of greater fools during its cycle because its security costs scale with price (see: boom-bust curve). Its vocal supporters are cringe. I've always agreed that bitcoin is pristine collateral while ETH has a place as a programmable crypto asset but things have changed. I'm at the point where the flippening is not a meme anymore - it is the guaranteed outcome of the supply/demand dynamics that we are witnessing now - just needs more time to play out. ETH is now the pristine collateral imo, and I don't see why in the future ETH can't have flipped Bitcoin multiple times.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/austonst enlightens us to the conflict of interest for entities running MEV block builder and MEV relays</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/105hh6b/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2023/j3cqss0/)

MEV-Boost relay transaction censorship has gotten a good amount of attention since the Merge, and for good reason. Fortunately, word has gotten around and the trend is improving.

So I think it's time to emphasize another problem in the relay space: relays who also run builders. Relay-builders as opposed to independent relays? I need a better term for this. This is informed by my time working on the [Aestus relay](https://aestus.live/), and while I believe our relay can help with this problem, I hope you can trust that my goal here is not marketing. We don't make any money off this relay anyway.

In a world without relays, proposers and builders would have to trust each other directly: depending on the implementation one would always be able to steal MEV from the other. Relays sit in the middle and take on all that trust. As long as the relay is trusted, proposers and builders each enter a trustless relationship with the other.

However, a malicious relay, working with one side or the other, can execute all the attacks they were supposed to prevent. A relay working with a builder can steal MEV from a proposer or the other builders, and likewise, a relay working with a proposer can steal MEV from a builder.

Now let's bring relay-builders into this. An entity that is running both a relay and a builder has a clear conflict of interest. Compromising the relay's neutrality by working together with their builder could immensely improve profitability. Let's list out some potential attacks that relay-builders could carry out. These are in roughly increasing order of subtlety and with names I'm making up on the spot, with "you" being the relay-builder:

1. **Single-Block Copying:** Some third party builder has submitted a block to the relay that is more valuable than the block your builder made. Simply copy all the transactions from the third-party builder's block, but make it so you keep any value that is not sent to the proposer. Send a bid to the proposer with your block instead of the other builder's. A competent builder should be able to detect this and trash your reputation.

1. **Ignoring Other Builders:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than your builder's block. You should pass on the third-party bid to the proposer. Instead, pretend you didn't see it. Submit your builder's bid instead. Done naively like this, the third-party builder should be able to catch it.

1. **Multi-Block Copying:** Multiple builders have submitted blocks with valuable MEV. Build your block from the most valuable transactions from each of them. Make sure your bid to the proposer will legitimately win the auction, but keep the rest of the MEV for yourself. I don't know if builders would detect this, might take some analysis and time.

1. **Obfuscated MEV Copying:** Same as with the first two copying attacks, but with intent to be subtle about it. For example, if a third-party builder/searcher has a truly novel source of MEV extraction that only they know how to do, they'd recognize if it were stolen, so only copy MEV that can be identified as a recognizable strategy and is unlikely to come from a private mempool. Implement some fuzzing, make your copied MEV transactions slightly different so as to give plausible deniability that maybe your builder found that MEV on their own. Might be hard to detect.

1. **Auction Manipulation:** Anyone can check the best current bid through the relay API, which is a problem in itself, but the relay has particularly low-latency access to this info. In case a third-party builder only very slightly outbids your builder, quickly create a new block with a winning bid and propose that instead. The relay has some wiggle room with timing to make sure your builder can always outbid. Catching this would require long-term analysis and may be covered by plausible deniability or obfuscation.

1. **Block Timing Manipulation:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than the one made by your builder. Give your block priority in the relay's block validation system, or better yet, don't waste time validating it at all (you made it, you trust it). Make your competitor's block low-priority for validation or otherwise stall it so it's less likely to be ready when the proposer asks for the best bid. Hard to detect, covered by plausible deniability, and current data APIs don't expose enough timing information to help with detection or can be manipulated. This could be an actual concern.

1. **Builder Colocation:** Most builders will make \~1 submission per second, with value increasing over time as more bundles and tx's arrive. Builders that are geographically closer to the relay, with lower latency, will tend to have slightly higher-value blocks because of it. If a relay and builder are running in the same data center, under the same account/project, on a high-speed private LAN, that will give them a competitive edge. This maybe doesn't quite qualify as an attack, but a neutrality concern at least.

I want to be clear that **I have no reason to believe existing relay-builders are malicious and carrying out these attacks**. But why accept the possibility that they may some day occur? Why connect to relays that require extra trust assumptions when there are alternatives?

Right now, Ultrasound and Agnostic are the only relays not operating their own builders. Aestus is temporarily running a builder, but it doesn't extract MEV, doesn't take any profit, and only operates until we get a reliable set of third-party builders connected (otherwise we might not have any blocks for connected proposers). I would encourage everyone to direct their validators and builders to those relays and to ask existing relay-builders to consider only running one or the other. I'm grateful to the early relay-builders for getting us off the ground, but now we can start to hold the space to a higher standard.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/superphiz has some predictions for the Shanghai upgrade</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/105hh6b/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2023/j3c2ahu/)

I'm going to make some guesses for what might happen on the beacon chain regarding withdrawals. I want to qualify these as "guesses", because reality rarely unfolds as we expect and it would overestimate my foresight to call them predictions. Also, since I'm not making predictions, I acknowledge that it's difficult to quantify the results of many of these guesses.

- Shanghai is likely to happen some time around Tuesday, March 28, 2023. This isn't based on any factual information and I'm VERY behind on core dev calls, but I do think that developers want to push this in March, and Tuesdays are a good day to do these. Guess confidence: 4%.
- Network usage will skyrocket immediately after the merge as people race to take advantage of whatever strategy they've developed to respond to withdrawals. Some folks will be racing to claim stolen beacon chain funds, while others will be racing to save their funds from an attacker. Other people will have novel strategies that I can't conceive. This will lead to high execution rewards for validators who propose those blocks. Guess confidence: 20%.
- MEV block rewards will be very high for several hours based on the previous point. Guess confidence: 15%
- There will be few "real" validator exits, but there will be validator shuffling that will appear as exits and spook some people. For example, providers who have merged or folded will want to re-secure their keys under new management and will exit to re-stake under improved security, but this won't be clear to observers who will only perceive it as "churn". Guess confidence: 30%.
- The price is likely to fluctuate 2% either way, but will quickly reach homeostasis because people are already committed to their positions. There will be sellers who have been eager to claim gains after having locked coins, and buyers who are comforted by the knowledge that withdrawals are real and sustainable. Guess confidence: 0%
- Over the next year, individual deposits to the beacon chain will climb steadily as observers who couldn't commit to an unknown timeline now accept that the beacon chain is stable. I'm expecting 20 million staked Ether aka 625,000 validators by the end of 2023. Guess confidence: 5%
- Large institutions will finally be comfortable depositing their treasuries into the beacon chain and taking staking rewards. This will occur over a 1-3 year period and result in significant locked coins. It remains to be seen whether they'll take a profit maximalist or chain maximalist approach to staking, but based on our educational efforts it's realistic to assume that many of these institutions will recognize the value of decentralization, trustlessness, and chain health when staking. Guess confidence: 10%
- We'll see a new wave of LSD products, with products who support chain health leading the charge, and products who who maximize greed seeing less usage. In simple terms: institutions know that parasitic engagement with the beacon chain will reduce the long term viability of their investment. Guess confidence: 20%
- Public goods like schools/universities, and local governments will slowly begin dipping their toes into staking, especially in cooperatives arranged around DVT solutions that help them dilute the risk of running validators. We ought to promote these cooperatives rather than encouraging centralized approaches. Guess confidence: 2%
- We'll discover that some people and entities have lost staking keys. In the true fashion of cryptocurrency, I expect these keys to miraculously turn up in someone's private possession after many years. Guess confidence: 5%

**BONUS**: What our community can do to support this transition:

- Educate everyone you can about the transition to Proof of Stake. Many people are still unaware that this has happened.
- Talk to people about the relationship between "good staking" on a healthy network and the price. People who think they're staking selfishly will harm themselves by reducing decentralization. Staking in decentralized ways will have a positive impact on the price.
- Help people recognize that withdrawals are a fruition of the promise by core developers to prioritize withdrawals after the merge. They deserve plenty of credit for being consistent and predictable.
- Don't let people get complacent. So many people promised to move to solo home staking, or even just a better staking solution when withdrawals were enabled, but there's a natural tendency to get lazy and complacent when the opportunity is real - don't let people be lazy!
- Keep learning and building. The price is a lagging indicator of what the developers and community bring to Ethereum. You don't improve the quality of your asset by simply watching the price.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/106bh8s/daily_general_discussion_january_8_2023/j3h7bg5)

There was a fairly-notable phishing post on r/CC yesterday where the user mistakenly sent tokens to an address that looked very similar to his actual address (same starting and ending characters). He originally thought he had clipboard malware that changed his address, but it turned out he actually copied to the wrong address.

If you look at his PolygonScan history days before the mistakenly transaction, you can see that he was targeted multiple times.

All these similar-looking address had interacted with his account in the past 2 weeks:

- 0xDD1B7Ce698d0d58Cd521A9c186e6a95CF043614C (his)

**This is known as [address poisoning](https://mirror.xyz/x-explore.eth/cL3d_CyNujXq8XY7ueP4omNXx_IY1EG5Dz0FD0vJ90M)**. Attackers send low-value token transactions and receive 0-value token transactions to-and-from your addresses, hoping that you accidentally pick their address in future transactions.

Blockchain explorers and and some wallets will show these transactions. The recommended way to avoid getting tricked is to use an address book of whitelisted addresses. Most wallets and exchanges have an address book feature.

**I've posted a comprehensive list of crypto scams here** along with best practices to avoid getting scammed: <https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/106lsai/comprehensive_list_of_common_crypto_scams_and/>

If you're active in DeFi, you'll probably come across many scams and random phishing airdrops on your accounts. Especially true on low-fee networks like Polygon PoS and BSC.

<summary>Random: u/MinimalGravitas discusses goats and staking?!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10827ir/daily_general_discussion_january_10_2023/j3qgc9r/)

GM EthFam,

So I've been thinking about whether LSDs represent almost a multipolar trap.

A multipolar trap is a situation where participants are incentivized to act in a way detrimental the good of the group, and to themselves in the long run. The most obvious example is the tradgedy of the commons. We each share a piece of land, it can support each of us grazing 10 goats. If I graze 11 goats the quality of the land might deteriorate, but so slowly it won't matter, whereas I get 10% more goat, it's an obvious choice. Unfortunately you all make the same obvious choice and so the field is overgrazed and after a few years becomes barren and most of everyone's goats starve. If you decide to be the better person and keep to the original limit of 10 goats, then all you're doing is disadvantaging yourself relative to the rest of us 11 goat havers. We can all afford more turnips than you due to goat inflation and so you end up out competed.

Getting back to ether staking... by using a centralized service rather than solo staking you get access to an LSD. This gives you advantages in terms of opportunity access, you can swap into something else if you want to or create leveraged positions or whatever.

Like with the shared field, the disadvantage is on a community level. The decentralization and 'legitimacy' of Ethereum the network, and by extention, ether the asset is compromized, meaning it is less likely to be as highly valued in the future. Sure, you could take the high ground and not use a centralized service, but then are you disadvantaging yourself with lost opportunity cost. And if you do, and most people chose a centralized service then you still lose out from the loss of perceived legitimacy anyway...

...

Except that entire scenario is not analogous to Ethereum staking today due to another option, that hopefully most of you have been hearing repeat in your heads the entire time you've been reading. Rocketpool solves the lose-lose coordination failure, by providing an option that gives people the ability to access an LSD without compromising the decentralization of the whole. With it the multipolar trap is easily disarmed, the field doesn't need to be depleated for individuals to gain the advantages.

RocketPool is the G.O.A.T.

<summary>Community: u/-lightfoot highlights the significance which staking withdrawals has on decentralisation and u/diego-d follows up with their zero to hero staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vgs6i/)

Don‚Äôt underestimate the decentralizing impact Shanghai will have. Lots of people fully aligned with Ethereum‚Äôs defining values like me have ETH staked with cexs where we would rather not, for various reasons, who will be empowered by withdrawals to revisit their position and consider going solo.

I‚Äôve run validators on testnet but don‚Äôt have the skills/confidence to do it with real money right now, but Shanghai marks a big psychological target for me to remedy that and it‚Äôs very easy to be inspired by people in this sub, describing how rocketpool, dappnode etc. are very easy to do. Plus ethstaker and all the guides. It‚Äôs taking on a huge financial responsibility but it‚Äôs about integrity and aligning one‚Äôs actions with one‚Äôs values and you see that across the Ethereum community and it is inspiring.

It might take 6 months but I‚Äôm really looking forward to watching the transition of ETH from centralized stakers to clean green homegrown (fanless, I recently learned here, so no noise and no fiddly dust hoovering!) validators.

I named my testnet validator raspberry pi ‚ÄòGoldfish‚Äô because I often couldn‚Äôt leave it alone more than a day without it dying. Even put a little goldfish sticker on it. I‚Äôm looking forward to carrying that bs over onto a nuc; name suggestions welcome.

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vp7io/>

This brings back memories. I was so systems illiterate that it took me about a week to set up my rig before even syncing the block chains. Almost every step in the guides I had to Google something or pester the kind people in the ethstaker discord. I‚Äôd never used Linux before. Had to actually Google where to find the command prompt in Ubuntu as if ‚ÄòTerminal‚Äô wasn‚Äôt obvious enough. Didn‚Äôt know what port forwarding was. Many such examples. Once I finally felt like I knew what I was doing, I wiped the entire system and started again from scratch. Then did that a couple more times. Each time getting quicker and more confident. I think by the 3rd try I had got it down to 30 minutes before syncing the blockchains. I ended up validating on testnet for only 1 day, then swapped over to mainnet. I specifically remember phiz telling me to practice on testnet longer but beacon chain launch was imminent. I hesitated due to no withdrawal mechanism but decided there was no way I was missing genesis lol. It‚Äôs been more than 2 years since then, my rig diligently staking 24/7 without any major problems. In a weird way it‚Äôs been one of the only constants in my life, as life‚Äôs events pass by.

Tldr; I agree Shanghai will likely increase decentralisation. if I can do it, literally anyone can, and will. A focus after Shanghai should be towards making the process easier to ensure it.

<summary>Community: u/RobertLobLaw2 discusses their journey from ETH holder to ETH staker</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zyspvz/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2022/j27v88q/)

I have a few Rocketpool validators that are currently pending. They should be active in 3 hours. After I write this comment, I'm going to bed. I'm not very active in this sub but I lurk like a mf. I'm feeling inspired to talk about my journey from an ETH Holder to an ETH Staker.

1. First I just want to say that it hasn't been much of a journey. Staking your ETH is not hard. I ran a 8 GPU mining rig for a couple years and the process to set up a validator through Rocketpool is a fraction of the difficulty of setting up a mining rig. Shoutout to the Rocketpool team for the easy to follow documentation.
1. Secondly, along the way, I realized that Rocketpool utilizes almost every novel financial tool that has gained traction in the world of Crypto. Through the process of setting up a Rocketpool node and validators I have interacted with Automatic Market Makers, Liquidity Pools, Flash Loans, and a DAO. I have used all of these novel financial tools to create a stream of passive income. The only thing missing was an NFT. Although I wouldn't really say that I was really missing it Bob.
1. I'll sleep well tonight knowing that when I wake up tomorrow I'll be a wealthier person.

That last statement will remain true until either Ethereum fails or I fail to uphold my responsibilities as a ETH Staker.

ICYMI: The target milestone for 2023 is to ship EIP-4844, aka Proto-Danksharding. If you want to make a difference in the Ethereum ecosystem and you're looking for a way to get involved, learn about EIP-4844 and educate others. While education feels low-value to many people, bringing more eyes to a project like this brings new developers and more momentum. Don't underestimate your own ability to make a difference on the network. I know that withdrawals in 2023 will get a lot of attention, and we know it's in the pipeline, but 4844 is the giant target.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2hswf0/)

My new year's resolution is to focus more on learning ethereum rather than focusing on price.

Lessons learnt in 2022:

1. I lost way too much Eth trying to trade during this bearmarket. Lesson: avoid short term trading. Not worth the time and mental stress.
1. I tried being a degen in 2022 by buying DOGE, trending NFTs, small cap coins and lost more money. Lesson: Be a reasonable investor and accumulate ETH and other high quality assets at undervalued prices.
1. My focus on prices has limited my learning. Lesson: Bear markets are for building and learning.

Goals:

1. Learn about Ethereum and its core upgrades
1. Learn programming - initially python +/- other web2 languages, which should all hopefully give me a good foundation for solidity / ethereum development

Accumulate more ETH

<summary>Analysis: u/RooftopPortaPotty continues their weekly investigation ofnew crypto CHROME extensions</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2jdzfl/)

This is the second installment of my series of posts regarding the privacy of various Chrome browser crypto wallet extensions.

First entry can be found here, where we analyzed Rabby.

My approach:

This analysis has shown that my previous approach of broadly categorizing findings under 'the ok, the bad, the ugly, and the weird' is insufficient, subjective, and does not properly represent what I wish to convey.

Using Kali Linux, I downloaded Google Chrome directly from google.com/chrome.

Analysis of encrypted traffic was completed using BurpSuite + the provided root cert, installed in chrome's local cert repo. Chrome is then launched with a proxy set to Burp's listening port.

I will not be doing any sort of transactions whatsoever. I will, however, connect the wallet to a dapp.

On this New Years Day we will be taking a look at Tally Ho!

The Tally Ho extension was downloaded from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tally-ho/eajafomhmkipbjmfmhebemolkcicgfmd>

I must start off by giving Tally Ho credit for something that Rabby did not implement. As I went through using the wallet to create a new address, I paid no attention to the seed phrase.

<https://imgur.com/bqsyl6E>

I was hit with a quiz that ensures that the user knows their seed phrase. I reinstalled Tally Ho, created a new address, and passed the quiz this time.

An excellent general security practice that every wallet should implement.

<https://imgur.com/zbJmXcs>

Upon installation, the first request Tally Ho generates is to api.coingecko.com in search of current token prices. Notice crab season in full effect.

<https://imgur.com/seC9btg>

Here we see a request for Arbitrum's token list.

This is a 'web3' wallet, and as such we see many requests destined for chains and defi services that us ethfinanciers wont (admit to, at least) be using much.

An example of such a request, one which is quite demonstrative of the rest, looks like https://imgur.com/AEjA8m1

I dont have a problem with this activity, but it would be great to have a more Ethereum-centric version of this wallet.

<https://imgur.com/VTx7WAJ>

api.blocknative.com is used to fetch Ethereum gas fees and block info.

<https://imgur.com/T3nHyI2>

Tally Ho reaches out to Compound Finance's Github repo 'token-list' for a list of, you guessed it, tokens.

For a benign example of why this is not such a great practice, check out this request to Trader Joe's 'token-list' repo.

<https://imgur.com/LXpv2j4>

The response is a 404. Not a huge problem, just a bit sloppy seeming. Could be bad news if an attacker is able to gain access to that repo, which is likely much less heavily protected than Trader Joe's other assets.

Here is where things get a bit more subjective.

<https://imgur.com/GAT5Bp8>

We see Ankr's API being used to get the ETH balance of my new Ethereum address, notice the value '0x0' in the response.

And for the Alchemy haters, Ive got some bad news:

<https://imgur.com/bsztI6Q>

Alchemy's API is used to fetch my address' balances of various tokens, which are specified by contract address in the POST request body.

You may notice requests to mainnet.infura.io in the above image. No need to worry, these requests were generated strictly by connecting to staking.synthetix.io.

One thing that left me a bit puzzled is this request to resolve.unstoppabledomains.com

<https://imgur.com/0C3NyGb>

My wallet address is sent as a GET parameter. Along with an 'Authorization:' HTTP header.

I have not had much time to look into this service, and would love to know more if anyone has any insight.

Refreshingly, no requests to telemetry services or advertisers were found.

I call upon the great /u/REALJohnBMacLemore. Would you please be willing to do the dirty deed, ser?

Happy New Year, yall!

<summary>Analysis: u/LogrisTheBard discusses the efficiency of yearn finances payroll system</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2osvx6/)

I continue to be amazed by the transparency of Defi sometimes. Just [look](https://llamapay.io/streams?chainId=1&address=ychad.eth) at the Yearn.finance employee expenses here. Continuously streamed, withdrawn whenever the payee wants. Compare this to your traditional corporate payroll system.

1. Why should I need a payroll advance service to draw money I'm already due for hours worked? An entire predatory industry should mostly not exist or at least should be replaced by something like Alchemix. I see no reason something like this couldn't be integrated into a time card system in an automated way for hourly employees too.
1. You know that whole labor board that people go to when their employer did something fucky with their wages? This makes it obvious instantly when the employer is behind on paying wages. The labor board could just monitor registered company addresses and automatically begin a process if a registered account is behind before the employees even notice to report something.
1. Why do you need a W2 when you have something like this? This is an IRS dream come true. Imagine all the management software like AGP you could save businesses.

But you know... people say crypto has no value.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/101zwim/daily_general_discussion_january_3_2023/j2tsika/)

Interesting message from Juno Finance:

> Dear User,
> 
> This is an important announcement.
> 
> Juno doesn't custody crypto assets and relies on crypto partners for providing these services. Due to uncertainty with our crypto partner who is responsible for crypto operations for Juno, we strongly recommend withdrawing your crypto assets into a self-custody wallet. You can also choose to sell these assets for cash and keep them secured in your Juno checking account which is FDIC insured up to $250,000 via Evolve Bank and Trust.
> 
> There are daily platform limits for sells and withdrawals and we‚Äôre working with our partner to increase them for a smoother transition. Due to current market uncertainty we have also disabled crypto buys on the platform and auto-converted some of the stablecoins (USDC, USDT and mUSDC) to USD. Any fees incurred will be reimbursed. We apologise for the inconvenience and will keep you posted.
> 
> All Banking and Card related services continue to operate as usual. We will also transition to a new crypto partner in the coming weeks.

Emphasis mine.

Maybe they're shifting around their crypto backend and they aren't sure how assets held by the crypto provider will be handled during the transition. It's cool that they advocate for self custody.

Heyyo! My Pride! I wanted to bring more attention to [this post by Maswasnos](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/101zwim/_/j2tsika) further down in the daily.

If you have crypto assets stored with Juno or Wyre, withdrawal them now!
The email in that post feels funny to me. The words seem exceptionally well chosen to provide the most warning with the least possible legal consequences. I suggest you heed their warning. If you custody with someone else, be sure they are not using Wyre to custody their assets. IMO, that is who Juno is attempting to warn you about.

Again, nothing confirmed, just my feeling.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/102vnu4/daily_general_discussion_january_4_2023/j2weoyq/)

Heya fam, I need some help collecting more scam examples that are different to those I already have. If anyone has examples, I'd appreciate a DM with it, a reply to this post with an imgur link or something or a discord DM at dreth#1988 if you have any good examples I haven't listed.

As of right now I have:

- Airdrop scams
- Fake exchange scams
- Excel malware
- Notification that you 'won a prize'
- An offer to use a referral code for 'mutual benefit'
- Someone offering to 10x your investment in 48 hours
- Notification of being whitelisted to participate on a presale
- Invitation to pump and dump discord groups
- Someone asking for help to exchange a token for another in a p2p exchange (despite the token being listen on uniswap with plenty of liquidity)
- A story of a scam crypto startup
- A fake USDC contract migration with instructions to basically get scammed signing some transactions
- The recent fake Chainlink scammer on reddit that DMd some users
- The NVO ICO scam and other ICO scams
- Fake token staking site scams
- Fake token listings on uniswap
- Twitter bots tagging me on fake airdrop claim sites
- Several email scams telling me money has been moved out of my wallet, that I've been hacked and all sorts of shit.

There's one notorious scam I know I'm missing and that's fake support people, so I'd appreciate at least one example of that, not more than one is needed.

If there's any meaningfully different or interesting scams you have examples of, please send them my way. I'd also apprecaite malware or anything that could be misleading to users or put them at risk. Do not post malicious links as a reply to this comment, just DM them to me.

I'm on the EVMavericks discord and moderate the StakeWise discord, verify my username well if you want to DM me on discord, don't get scammed.

A million thanks to everyone that have helped me out !

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/102vnu4/daily_general_discussion_january_4_2023/j2w5lte/)

have a great day my fellow "eth maxis".

bear markets are great for buidlers.

while looking for web3/blockchain related jobs, I began working on my own blockchain project :
I'm building (from scratch front-end/back-end, the whole 9 yards) an LSD niche focused DeX liquidity aggregator.

way down the road, I'm thinking about adding features like evolving the project into a platform that will make it easier for users to participate into liquidity pools, create and run rocketpool minipool, create finance-focused NFTs using oracles and open order books.

even if the project is a total failure and absolutely no one uses it, I'm still happy to be full hand on on it building everything from UI/frontend to the backend and integration APIs of Uniswap/0x and interacting with Rocketpool/uniswap and building smart contracts.

as a software engineer, it's an experience that is like a breeze of fresh air to do a fun side passion project that may or may not transform into a "real" product.

worst case scenario, no one uses it but it gives me legitemacy when talking about my experience in the web3 with recruiters.

best case scenario, users love it and it becomes my full time job.

"average" scenario, it has some kind of traction, and keep being a fun passion project I will maintain while working full time job somewhere else.

anyway, thank you for reading my post, have a great day and may the force be with you
