In 1732 the world's most populous city* was Ayutthaya in what is now Thailand, with a population estimated at 1 million. It was the seat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which reigned from 1351 to 1767. 

The city could support such a large population because of the prodigious rice production just up the Chao Phraya River. The kingdom was a maritime power that traded surplus grain for luxuries and finished goods, establishing itself as one of the three great powers of Asia alongside Vijayanagar and China.

By 1732, however, its political power was in a slow decline and the capital was destroyed after a 14-month seige by the Burmese. Today, Phra Nakhom Si Ayutthaya is home to 50,830 people and a UNESCO world heritage site in the old city.

* World urban macrodynamicist George Modelski estimated Ayutthaya's population at 1 million in 1700. It's not universally accepted or even knowable what would have been the most populous city in 1732.

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

Diva has launched two community votes that will have a great bearing on their future:

1. [Self-limiting Diva](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/proposal/44802814205789959072230810924382136907393872780309912200640771189684983862410) - Should DIVA self-limit to 22%? As a living network, most aligned parties recognize the value in maintaining a healthy balance of operators. This stewardship reduces the viability of attacks and increases the long term resilience of the network. Providers who adopt self-limiting signal their alignment with Ethereum.

2. [Adopt Diva Staking DAO Community Guidelines](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/proposal/83348890401949751744687944216855884103596472682649172974139622969919584955539) - These are general guidelines for how the DIVA DAO ought to work, these guidelines make great sense to me and I support them.

You may also be interested to know that DIVA is in the process of vampiring stake away from the largest LST as Danny Ryan suggested [in this very valuable talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ddkSa1ZuI) with /u/evanvanness. Because of my own desire for conflict avoidance, I won't say much about it, but you can find details [here](https://twitter.com/divastaking/status/1707060825855578425) and I believe that /u/nixorokish is eager to talk about it.

[u/18boro](https://reddit.com/u/18boro):

Diva, the ETH staking protocol,  initiated an interesting vault a few days ago, where you can deposit ETH, or even better, stETH, and accumulate diva as well as the underlying rewards that's included in stETH. When diva officially launches the stETH will be converted to divaETH ,or whatever they decide to call it, hopefully not dETH :). It's a sort of vampire attack on stETH, which we obv need more of. So if you sit on stETH, wash off your sins with this one simple trick.  The protocol hasn't officially launched yet and there is no UI which shows your farming rewards and such. The short story is, stakers are divided in tranches based on how early they are, and the earlier tranches receive more diva per ETH/stETH staked than the later. This is obviously risky, it is a novel protocol, but at least the staking is done through enzyme, which has existed several years already.   


Here is the staking UI: [https://diva.enzyme.finance/#vaults](https://diva.enzyme.finance/#vaults)

<summary>u/benido2030 and u/KuDeTa of Aestus relay discus MEV relays being public goods</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16u6ws6/daily_general_discussion_september_28_2023/k2kiylo/)

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

I just read [this post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16tbda8/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2023/k2gb47e/) thanks to the daily doots. I was expecting something like it, cause it was basically announced in the [Empire podcast episode](https://blockworks.co/podcast/empire/4ee75432-5c0b-11ee-9ac4-d31bf67ceb24) 2 days ago. 

I know there is a high chance relays at one point will be gone, cause they will be enshrined. But this will not happen any time soon. So we need relays for some more years, but they don't make any money. 

In my opinion relays = public goods. Public goods need funding. Who can we turn to to get some grants to make sure we can keep or even increase the number of relays? Which protocols have (retroactive) public goods funding? Which delegates do we have to pressure to get funds? What else can we do to improve the situation?

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) and I run the aestus relay. 

I agree - relays are probably here to stay in some form for years. While enshrined PBS would be great, it's worth reiterating Auston's point: making it unbypassable by design is a highly desirable goal. 

MEV is a latency game, and centralised MEV platforms like relays are likely to always have a latency advantage over an in-protocol gossip network. This delta in latency is a delta in profit, and so if ePBS can't ever compete with out of protocol PBS (relays, SUAVE, etc), excepting significant adoption by staking pools (etc) seems unrealistic. At that point it's utility in the protocol is somewhat compromised. 

My sense is that the EF and community are unlikely to move forward until we find a design that meets this unbypassability requirement. It may well be that the current line of research has truly reached a dead end and a fresh approach is required. Unfortunately, It also creates problems for related ambitions such as MEV-burn. 

Central public goods funding in the relay space is fraught with administrative and political complexity. Views over censorship are particularly tricky and fundraising is a bit of a nightmare. 

On one hand, Aestus is a relatively baby relay - on the other, we are regularly responsible for \~3% of Ethereum blocks. Who should pay to keep our lights on? It may be that relays need to form a market and charge a modest fee to validators. I'd be intrigued to know what ethfinance think about that.

<summary>u/SeaMonkey82 is going hard testing on Holesky, not all heroes wear capes</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2rxyvg/)

Daily Holesky:  
  
Manually configured remote keystores in nimbus v23.9.1 appear to be broken.  Log states that the validator is loaded, but it never begins attesting.  
  
`--network holesky` on ethereumjs now uses the correct genesis, but still seems to be failing to serve deposit logs.  
  
I ended up deleting and recreating the slashing protection database for web3signer in postgres.  Having already configured the same validators using web3signer on Holesky v1, none of my validators were able to start attesting when they became active.  
  
Spotted a bug on beaconcha.in.  In the `Attestation Assignments` mouseover for the validator, `Executed` includes the two `Scheduled` slots.  This was easy to spot when several of my Holesky validators have yet to attest.  


I will eventually need to upgrade my storage array for Holesky, but more pressingly, I probably need to upgrade my CPU.  With 30 client pairs, the 15 minute load average on my Threadripper 3960X is consitently well above the recommended one-per-thread of 48.  
  
A lot has happened in the last \~36 hours, and there are probably several notable things I'm forgetting right now.  I need a nap.

<summary>u/benido2030 is rallying the community around public goods funding!</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2p2x9p/)

I *really* believe in this community. It's my favorite place and I love the people writing and reading. But I feel we can do more, if we improved coordination. There is so much (financial, vocal, emotional) power that we are not really using yet. 

[u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) both announced that [Blocknative has shut down their MEV relay and explained why it's concerning](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16tbda8/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2023/k2gb47e/). Blocknative's Matt Cutler basically explained the reasons for this in this [Empire podcast episode](https://blockworks.co/podcast/empire/4ee75432-5c0b-11ee-9ac4-d31bf67ceb24). It comes down to "relays don't make money, but cost money" (and Blocknative is a company with investors that expect returns - and relays have negative returns). 

So what are relays and why are they important? Relays are important for PBS aka proposer builder separation, MEV capturing and specifically for MEV-boost. MEV is every everywhere. Users make transactions and generate MEV opportunities. These transactions are analyzed by searchers, who insert (e.g. add before or after the tx) their own transactions and forward them to builders. Builders collect all tx (from searchers, but also the public mempool) and build blocks with the highest value. Builders then basically forward the blocks to validators (via MEV-boost, a solution outside of the protocol) including the ETH denominated reward they are willing to pay if there block is chosen/ proposed. This is where relays come into play. They relay the blocks and make sure the validator gets paid and the network can't be attacked. As basically always in Ethereum, decentralization is key, so we need multiple relays. PBS doesn't work without relays, but there are no revenues, no revenue share, no nothing for relay devs/ operators. Searchers, builders and validators make money, relays are basically the only infra in the MEV supply chain that we expect to work without getting paid. 

There are some theories why a small fee wouldn't work (builders would only use free relays, hence relays with a rev-cut would be excluded most of the time etc.). So in my opinion (retroactive) public goods funding (PGF) is the best way to get it done. 

Here's where this sub comes in! I would like to

\- use this communities knowledge to identify potential sources for PGF

\- see if we as a community can influence how funding/ grants are distributed (e.g. if governance tokens we all own can vote for an application)

\- use our voices to spread the word about the importance of relays and why funding is essential 

&#x200B;

For example there is [Optimism's RPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf). If Ethereum doesn't work, OP as an ETH L2 doesn't work. In my opinion it's a nobrainer that [u/austonst](https://reddit.com/u/austonst) and [u/kudeta](https://reddit.com/u/kudeta) (who run the aestus relay) should receive OP funding, but we all know that's not how it works. But if our OP delegates ([u/liberosist](https://reddit.com/u/liberosist), [u/\_weboftrust](https://reddit.com/u/\_weboftrust), [u/minimalgravitas](https://reddit.com/u/minimalgravitas), [u/pseudotheos](https://reddit.com/u/pseudotheos) and more) coordinated, I am sure their voices can make a change. 

I have no idea how the EVM treasury is doing, but maybe we as EVMs can come together and think about ways to support relays in general and the aestus relay specifically. 

[u/kudeta](https://reddit.com/u/kudeta): You said yesterday that applying for all these grants and funding was complex and a lot of effort. If you want me to help, I am more than happy to e.g. sign-up in the name of the aestus relay for the OP RPGF round 3 and / or gitcoin grants. I have never done something like that, so it might not be perfect but of course I would coordinate with you to make sure the aestus relay is presented in the correct way (on every level). Obviously this would be completely free for you.

<summary>u/MinimalGravitas wants to see some more community pushback and comments on the Lido Arbitrum grant proposal</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16v2i2p/daily_general_discussion_september_29_2023/k2p3xc3/)

Paging [u/bob-rossi](https://reddit.com/u/bob-rossi), [u/dmihal](https://reddit.com/u/dmihal) and any other Arbitrum delegates.

I'm interested in seeing some commentary from EthFinance's representatives over on the Arbitrum governance forum with regards to the request from Lido for 5 million ARB tokens to, as hanniabu so perfectly puts it, *bankroll Lido’s attack on the network.*

Using the influence we have across different DAOs seems like a simple no-brainer way we can help protect Ethereum from capture. We held off their proposal on Optimism last year, I would love to see the same again this time.

[Insert stirring backing track, e.g. [*From Hell To Glory* by End of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcnJD7q1YZc)]

If you don't want your DAO to pay to incentivize the growth of Lido then now is the time to say so.

This is a moment when governance can really matter. When the social layer actually has a decent amount of power. When *you* can make a difference to the future of this ecosystem.

It takes some courage to put yourself in the firing line, to voice an opinion against one of the most powerful entities in Ethereum. It maybe feels like a foolhardy risk to stand in the way of a juggernaut worth billions of dollars, but the alternative is that everyone rolls over and lets the credible neutrality of our network be stolen away, and with it will go the possible future of Ethereum as the base layer for not just the financial system but for global coordination.

We must not let Moloch win.

The cold war with Lido will be long and hard, and this is just one of many battles, but it is the one we can impact now, and it is one we can win.

Ultimate victory depends on us not losing every battle. It depends on us not giving up anything without a fight. And we must be victorious, because in the long run, without victory there can be no survival for the dream of a future that Ethereum represents.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

It is even better, almost any address can be a burn address. You just have to proof that you know a short number whose hash is equal to the public address. This means there is no possibility for the sender to be sanctioned as there is no on chain proof that the address you sent ETH to is a burn address. The receiver side is a different story, there it is as far as I know obvious that the funds received used this scheme. The last all core devs call had a longer discussion about it and one person advocated to be more cautious and not to use these kind of zk circuits on L1 just yet as they are rather untested and previous iterations of similar schemes had bugs. In the longer run this scheme is definitely so amazing and I am a big believer that privacy needs to be part of the base layer.

For those confident we'll have another bullrun, what will drive the eth price up? Previously we had ICOs, then defi/yield farming and then NFTs. Is there anything left? Also fees will be lower due to L2s which may actually be negative for the eth price unless L2 activity goes 100x.
