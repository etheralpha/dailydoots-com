<summary>Ecosystem: u/Ethical-trade and u/etheraider share Coinbase's latest release and how it validates Ethereum's scaling strategy
</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/119q5kg/daily_general_discussion_february_23_2023/j9oq1yx/)

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

In the past, Binance launched its own L1 with the Binance Smart Chain.

FTX launched its own L1 with Solana.

But today [Coinbase commits to Ethereum by launching its own L2 on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809).

This means than Coinbase's interests are now fully aligned with Ethereum, with bridging of users and capital directly to the Ethereum ecosystem. 

This means that marketing made by Coinbase for its chain will now directly benefit Ethereum.

Eth is this L2's native token, with which gas will be paid.

This fully validates Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap.

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider):

While some may find the Coinbase "Base" news underwhelming or would have hoped for something different, the way I see it, this is a huge signal in the crypto space that the number one crypto company in the world is choosing to go all in on building on Ethereum. 

Up until now you could argue Coinbase was "impartial" in its offerings and did not show favoritism amongst coins, but now it seems they are willing to forego impartiality to build on the project they believe in most.

They couldve chosen to enhance lightning network/build an alternative, or build on solana, or the "new" smart contract enabled Cardano, but no they chose Ethereum.

That is something I would consider "significant."

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Maleficent_Plankton goes into detail on the Polygon outage</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ak2qc/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2023/j9sjnjy/)

**Yesterday's Polygon validator "outage" was wild**:

1. There was a [157-block reorg](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388)
1. The [block explorer](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/) went down for an hour
1. Many validators (at least 25) went out of sync and continued to have issues syncing for 12-24 hours.

It was big enough that:

1. Polygon rushed out a **new governance proposal**, [PIP-9](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-9-performance-benchmark-adjustment/11387/4), and passed it within 12 hours. This proposal reduced validator SLA requirements from 98% back to 95% in order to [save 18-23 validators](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators) from getting offboarded due to missing their checkpoints SLA.
1. The co-founder of Polygon stated that they are exploring **[replacing their entire Bor/Heimdall blockchain consensus protocol](https://twitter.com/mihailobjelic/status/1628926312076423170)** with a single-blockchain solution.

**Background**: What happened is that several Polygon validators experienced sync issues, which then lead to giant cascade of outages for most validators. The reason for the reorg is supposedly [a bug between their Bor and Heimdall layers](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388), though the team has yet to give details on the bug.

**Checkpoint SLAs**: Back in Aug 2022, there was a governance proposal, [PIP-4](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956), to move towards permissionless validation.

> "In its current state, the PoS validator network is not entirely permissionless in that the previously-selected set of validators has largely persisted since testnet."

The proposal added an SLA requirement that 95% of median average of last 700 checkpoints are signed by the validator. If the validator fails to meet the SLA, they are placed in a Grace Period have another 700 checkpoints to meet it. Otherwise, they get offboarded from staking. After 2 months, the SLA increased from 95% to 98%.

**What happened yesterday concerning the checkpoint SLA**:

Due to this rule and validators missing checkpoints yesterday, 25 out of 100 validators were at risk of getting kicked off staking.

The emergency PIP-9 vote to reduce the SLA was passed, saving most of the validators. Only 2 validators got offboarded and 5 more are in the Grace Period.

It's good they're finally taking the reorg issue more seriously, but I think they should've addressed this a long time ago.

<summary>Random: u/austonst is doing the ETHDenver daily recaps</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11bdlrh/daily_general_discussion_february_25_2023/j9xiefc/)

**ETHDenver Day 1**

Last year, I attended ETHDenver and [made a post each day in which I primarily summarized the best talks I heard that day](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sxm6cx/daily_general_discussion_february_21_2022/hxswh7b/), and also commented a little about my general experiences at the conference. ETHDenver 2023 has now begun, and I intend to do the same this year. As with last year, the first few days are slow: only one stage with talks starting late and ending early. So not too much to cover.

It seems that, also like last year, [all talks are recorded to Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver), one stream per stage. But for a given talk, figuring out which stage and what timestamp is not trivial. It's not *too* hard either, and for today I figured I'd try tracking down timestamps but I'm really skeptical that I'll want to spend the time on that as the days get longer. If there's one you really want to see, let me know and I can probably find it pretty quick given that I know what the different stages are and can probably recognize the style of a given talk's slides at a glance. But in general I'll link to the schedule page for each talk, which should be enough to point you in the right direction for learning more.

* [Rick Lamanna, Founder of OpenQ](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/d4ef6cc0-2bea-4408-bc63-72d41993415d/8d679f4b-a4d9-4450-9996-571b694850a2) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h14m2s)) talked about crypto hackathons. Gave some general advice on how to best participate and pursue bounties, and then mentioned some trends such as the prevalence of bounties meaning that hackathon teams are starting to say "if you don't pay a bounty for us to use your tool, we're not going to use it".
* [u/DoubtStarsAreFire and u/htimsk of Luau DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/c4b2f0e5-058d-4dba-9452-0d4033ef98fb/585f5cdd-dc90-4620-b6ab-12ce4f5bb13f) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h36m16s)) talked about Hodlercon, which needs no introduction here. It was a fun talk about a fun event, good vibes all around. I personally would have been interested in some more of the behind-the-scenes about what it takes to form a Wyoming DAO (and why to do so) and organize a group vacation while maintaining participant pseudonymity, but the conference organizers surprised them last minute with this day-1 timeslot so I know there were some serious time constraints.
* [Brian Wilkes](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/fbd6c346-8883-4ed6-9220-68bc17f4770e/c32b46bc-57e5-4fe0-b3df-500718789823) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h2m43s)) gave a nice overview of zero knowledge proofs as applied to Ethereum scaling. Nothing particularly new to me, but I think it could be a nice overview or refresher for many.
* [Josh Forman of ShapeShift DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/a1236544-05ff-43a9-868e-294cc40eca14/e0b04682-d3a7-4757-87a4-4595a63decd7) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h26m50s)) covered ShapeShift's experience operating as a DAO, and in particular how they fared during a period of serious bear market financial woes. There are some good general insights into DAO structure and operation that I found myself able to relate to the EVMavericks DAO. Some of his main lessons: be clear about your governance process, don't try to figure out too much ahead of time, keep open and transparent communication, leadership and hierarchy can exist but should be delegated (and can be revoked) by the community.

On a personal note, it's kind of amazing how much I expect my experience at ETHDenver will be different this year. Last year I knew nobody personally and was generally content to fill my days with nothing but listening to talks and occasionally chatting with strangers. But this year? I didn't go half an hour before I started bumping into folks I know. I have [a project](https://www.aestus.live/) that I can explain to people who ask what I've been working on (and they seem to find it very interesting (!), but I need to stop assuming that everyone knows how staking and MEV work). I tentatively have a hackathon team (with folks from this community) for a project I think will be bite-sized but still quite valuable. And I need to juggle driving back home occasionally for some classes I'm taking, so I've accepted I'm going to have limited free time this next week. But it'll just be packed so full of fun things!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I also have the EVMavericks t-shirts for those who signed up on Discord. I won't be lugging around the huge box everywhere I go, but I'll try to set aside multiple timeslots when I can set up shop in one spot, let everyone know, and hand them out. Got 100 EVMavs stickers to hand out too.

[u/stablecoin](https://reddit.com/u/stablecoin):

Can't believe there's this many upvotes. Off the top of my head I can think about:

* Finalizing the Merge Event end of March kicking off a major staking reshuffling for probably the first and last time in the networks history. Every single LSD that has a shot need to make their move in the next 2-6 months or possibly never gain share again. Keeping an eye on RPL, BTRFLY, FXS, SWISE for possible shorter term catalysts.
* Upcoming Arbitrum token event, huge amount of new protocols launching on Arbitrum daily lately.
* Launch of final Scroll Network Open Testnet on Goerli announced just today: <https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1630258973856395264>
* Polygon ZKEVM launching March 27: <https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1629736205720977408>
* Optimism TVL continuing to grow, Synthetix and Velodrome updates in the works.
* Base (Coinbase) announcement, dapps and onboarding sooon
* Starkware should continue to drip out news/updates as all these other L2 catalysts take shape, still waiting on their main net launch
* New Rocketpool LSD built on top of RPL to scale Rocket Pool and decentralized staking <https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1630310094981468161>
* ZK Sync onboarding dapps getting ready for their main net launch (soon tm)
* Blur passing Open Sea in volume for many days now, currently lots of active farming possibilities for useless JPGS
* Yuga Labs announcing new NFT project with Bitcoin Ordinals
* Sensible EU stablecoin and defi adoption
* SEC fights against everyone claiming it's a security

This bear market is honestly so much harder to keep track of developments than the last one. All you could do last bear was take a Maker CDP loan and wait for Michael Saylor to buy Bitcoin. Maybe price action stinks but you can never say crypto is boring.

[Edit] Also just remembered Spotify NFTs, Starbucks Polygon NFT rollout in progress, and some of my Reddit WSB NFT's getting a nice premium lately.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

Money should be boring. The fact that we had exciting money for a few years (bootstrapping/awareness phase of Bitcoin, then of Ethereum) is a marvel in the history of money.

If you think about it, new types of money don't pop up very often. In the history of money, we've only really had three major types, invented in 6000 BC, 600 BC, and 2008 CE.

* Physical barterable commodities as monies (backed by physical utility, 6000 BC)
* Trust-based monies (backed by their utility in abstracting away the trade of these cumbersome physical commodities by instead trading surrogate notes representing promises made by a trusted authority, 600 BC)
* Self-sovereign monies (monies that exist nowhere and everywhere as information that polices itself as it floats around, backed by their utility in eliminating the need for surrogacy or trust in creating abstract monies, 2008 CE).

You could argue that the jump from gold-backed notes to fiat notes was another fundamental evolution of money, but in any case we have been very lucky to live through this incredibly special decade.

So now begins the long, boring process of executing on the existing roadmap, and integrating Ethereum with the old, boring economy. We've had our big bang moment for this three thousand year period - perhaps in another three thousand years civilization will come up with yet another fundamentally new type of money and we'll see another big bang (thousands of years from now, quantum physics may allow us to have conversations with the laws of physics and directly ask those laws of physics to enforce certain constraints on our reality, a.k.a. "magic").

In three thousand years though, if the word "I" still makes sense to describe me, if I am even aware at that point of the events taking place on planet Earth in the material plane, and humans do invent a fourth type of money, at that point I probably won't care.

<summary>OPSEC: u/Tricky_Troll has some spiel about spammers and the report button</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11d4bra/daily_general_discussion_february_27_2023/ja9t6dn/)

Thanks for those of you vigilantly reporting the spam post on the front page. A quick dive into the user posting it and the other user commenting in support of the scam found a history of similar posts with the same free reddit awards. Don't trust any supposed uncollateralised DeFi protocols. They're almost certainly a scam unless basically everyone is talking about such a breakthrough.

Reminder of things to look out for in identifying spam and scams on Reddit:

**Spam posts: (if yes it's probably a scam)**

- Did they gain a lot of upvotes in the first 20 mins and then stop gaining traction?
- Does the user history have lost of similar posts or low effort comments about the same product posted by different users?
- Does the post have lots of low tier Reddit awards with relatively few upvotes?
- Does the user have low karma or karma farming indications like having a history of posting in random or low effort subs?
- Does the user and other users commenting in support of the post have a generic usernames with a shared pattern such as "AmazingReindeer123" or "GlowingPancake4679"?

Aside from this, there are some basic rules such as:

- If someone you don't know DM'd you it's probably a scam. Even if you want to be polite and respond to an unexpected DM, don't reveal any info or click any links until you're sure they are legit.
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
- If something raises even just one of the above flags, do some googling and delve into who else is talking about it. If you're seeing no organic looking chat about it then it's probably a scam.

Please remember to use the report button! In a sub with active mods multiple reports always signals to the mods that something needs investigating.

For those of you who are interested, this is the user who posted it and take a look and see if you can see the patterns of a scammer in their posts and post history. <https://reddit.com/user/SpicateHammer451>

Stay safe out there, folks!

<summary>Random: u/Sal_T_Nuts discusses discussing staking</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2023/jah8knp/)

My brother: So how's it going with that secret little thing you are doing with Ethereum, that miner sitting on your desk? You must be very smart how do you manage it? Must be a lot of work.

Me thinking: Oh that's right I'm running a validator I almost forgot.

That thing is still running perfectly turning dust into ETH without looking at it for months. Yes, staking is very hard and mind consuming. All I do is wait for my phone to prompt an update and then I run the ethstaker wizard after a few weeks. I am very sramt!

This week I managed to get my coworker into solo staking without telling him I am one myself, but I think he knows. Dude is already heavily invested in getting the best performance out of his machine. What a nerd (He's actually a very nice guy that just loves computers). Tells me he has a lot of unused parts freshly bought just because they were off price. He was flabbergasted about the low specs needed and was kind of disappointed. I guess he was expecting to run some sort of data center in his home?

Maybe I'll tell him to run a Solana node instead, if he really wants to drown in debt and get no profit at all (even run at a loss). Good thing is that he understands. He immediately linked the correlation about decentralization needing easy hardware to work the most efficient. Can't expect normal people to run data centers right? They have the money, but not the technical knowledge. They do not want a beefy machine taking their electricity and bandwidth away. These were his exact words, and I was astounded by his quick thinking.

I wanted to direct him to the right sources to run a validator but he was already talking about running Geth and Lighthouse and was talking about all sorts of Linux command stuff. He was already smarter then me about validating in one day. I guess he's going to be just fine.

Coworker, if you manage to cross this post and recognize me. Doxx me and I will tell your mother!!
