<summary>u/haurog shares an analysis from Ethpandaops on how higher blob counts affects attestations and timing games</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qdbmtv/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2026/nzp7ztw/)

Ethpandaops did a great analysis of high blob counts and attestation rates to the blocks by validators. The max blob count increased to 21 per block with the BPO2 fork on January 7th. Ethpandaops looked at how high blob counts influence the correct head attestation of validators. The head attestation is the vote by a validator which states what the newest block is of the chain that the validator sees. If a block takes longer to propagate through the network, then it might not reach the validator in time to make a correct head vote. 

Ethpandaops found a clear decrease of correct head votes the more blobs there are per block. That does not sound good, but they then analyzed it further and looked at the block proposers. Some of them play timing games, which means they delay the publication of a block to increase the MEV capture. These timing games leave less time for the published block (and blobs) to propagate through the network. They grouped the block proposers into 3 groups (conservative, neutral and suspect) which reflects their timing game severity. Conservative ones do adhere to the standard protocol and publish blocks when expected, whereas the suspect ones delay to block proposal as much as possible. They found that blocks proposed by conservative proposers did not have any decrease in head votes even at very high blob counts, whereas suspect proposers saw a large reduction of head votes (5-7%). This means the network can handle large blob counts reliably, but node operators which are playing timing games will have to rethink how they do it, as missing head votes on their proposed blocks also reduces their revenue. No idea if the missing revenue from lower head votes is substantial enough to change their timing games though. It also means that planning for further blob count increases will have to account for these suspect actors as they are part of the network and the network resilience degrades faster due to their timing games. 

I guess the much lower MEV rewards block proposers get nowadays helps that the problem of timing games is not more widespread. And further reduction of MEV might help to make this problem less relevant. Overall, I think the the extreme timing games player need to be publicly shamed, so here is a list of them according to the timing game score by ethpandaops: P2P.org, gateway.fm, everstake, stakingfacilities_lido, bitstamp, blockscape_lido, Kraken, blockdaemon_lido, and figment.

[u/Ok_Budget9461](https://reddit.com/u/Ok_Budget9461) and I [had a solid conversation on stablecoins](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qbj1jg/we_need_better_decentralized_stablecoins/nzb5fpv/) over on one of Vitaliks top level posts. I think more people would enjoy it than got to see it so I'm crossposting it over here for the curious.

We talked about development priorities, how government control is affected by blockchains, human psychology in selecting instruments, building legitimacy over time, and a meandering of other topics along the way.

[u/Ok_Budget9461](https://reddit.com/u/Ok_Budget9461):

I get the vision, but I think we sometimes over-theorize this.
The USD “rules” globally not because it’s perfect, but because it’s liquid, understood, and widely accepted. That makes it a very practical reference.

Any alternative index has the same problem. Gold? Its price is also influenced and financialized. A basket of goods? Who defines and updates it. Energy? Same issue.

So the problem isn’t that USD is flawed (it is), it’s that there is no neutral, manipulation-free unit of account. At least USD is tangible in everyday economic reality.

Maybe the real goal isn’t escaping USD entirely, but building systems that can survive its devaluation, rather than pretending we can anchor value to something “pure”.

These are open questions, not answers — but ignoring the practicality side feels just as risky as ignoring decentralization.

> Maybe the real goal isn’t escaping USD entirely, but building systems that can survive its devaluation, rather than pretending we can anchor value to something “pure”.

Nailed it. With full tokenization of RWAs Ethereum will give people the freedom to hold whatever they choose. We can choose to reference price things in whatever is the most liquid and integrated asset at the time but Ethereum can reduce the friction of changing that choice.

So rather than try to create a pure reference instead make technology that can peg to any reference, systems to facilitate exchange, and systems to facilitate coordinated migration of liquidity if something bad happens with that reference. Then let everyone choose for themselves.

That all said, even if we choose USD as a reference what can we do to increase the market share of stablecoins that aren't just T-Bill reserve backed and feeding Tether billions of dollars of profit annually at the expense of the web3 ecosystem. Ethena is a good start but it's heavily dependent on liquidity on centralized exchanges. DAI was promising once, I'm not as excited about USDS. Everything more decentralized than frxUSD has basically negligible adoption. So if Secretary Bessent is right and we're heading to $3T of stablecoins what can we do to ensure [that Tether isn't siphoning $90B a year from our ecosystem?](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/treasury-yield/)

[u/Ok_Budget9461](https://reddit.com/u/Ok_Budget9461):

I think this is where theory and human behavior quietly diverge.

On paper, flexible references, RWAs, and the ability to migrate liquidity between anchors make total sense. From a systems perspective, that’s probably the “correct” long-term direction.

But in practice, most people are deeply distrustful — and for good reason. They don’t want abstractions, optionality, or future guarantees. They want something tangible, legible, and boring. Something they already understand.

USD isn’t dominant because people believe in it philosophically. It’s dominant because you can touch its effects in everyday life: prices, salaries, rent, debt. That familiarity matters more than purity.

To reach the level you’re describing — where users comfortably switch references, trust migration mechanisms, and accept layered risks — we’re talking about a lot of cultural and experiential runway, not just better contracts. That kind of trust is earned slowly, usually after systems survive multiple stress events without breaking.

So maybe the path isn’t to replace USD as a reference, or even compete with it directly, but to prove reliability first: survive drawdowns, handle chaos cleanly, don’t surprise users. Over time, that’s what turns abstraction into something people feel is “real”.

Until then, most users will choose the thing that feels concrete over the thing that is theoretically superior. Not because they’re wrong — but because money is about confidence before it’s about design.

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

I don't disagree that the instrument we would switch to will trend towards being a battle tested one but whether we peg to gold, a basket of fiats, a cost of living calculation, or ETH is less important than that we enable personal choice and are prepared for an eventual dollar collapse. I say this not just because we're witnessing historic currency mismanagement that I speculate this makes a global reserve currency shift likely in my lifetime but also because Ethereum was created to set people free and focusing on enabling personal choice seems most in line with that ethos and my own.

[u/Ok_Budget9461](https://reddit.com/u/Ok_Budget9461):

There’s also a layer we haven’t really touched yet: governments.

Even if we solve the technical side — flexible references, migration of liquidity, robust oracles — there’s still the question of how much financial autonomy states are actually willing to tolerate once these systems move beyond the niche.

Financial freedom sounds great in theory, but from a government’s perspective it directly conflicts with:
- monetary policy,
- capital controls,
- taxation,
- and, ultimately, political power.

So the question isn’t just can we build systems that give people choice, but how far that choice is allowed to scale before it gets constrained. History suggests that once something becomes systemically relevant, it stops being ignored.

That’s another reason why I think “boring and practical” matters so much. Systems that look like tools tend to survive longer than systems that look like threats. Gradual adoption, clear use cases, and integration with existing economic reality buy time and legitimacy.

In that sense, resilience might not just mean surviving market stress or oracle failures — it also means surviving regulation, pressure, and attempts at control without breaking or forcing users into all-or-nothing decisions.

Financial freedom probably won’t arrive as a clean break. More likely it’ll come as a slow negotiation between technology, users, and states — with a lot of compromise along the way.

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

I don't think most governments actively restrict your legal right to invest in companies at least domestically. Sure, many people in less developed nations don't have access to financial services to make such investments but it's rarely actively outlawed. The only thing blockchains change about that is they reduce friction. They provide a more efficient [economic engine](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/economic-engine/). For example if you were legally able to buy Microsoft stock before through a brokerage now you can buy an RWA that will have similar legal controls as the stock did but through the RWA issuer. Doing this with blockchains reduces settlement times and has a smattering of other [blockchain advantages](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/blockchain-superpowers) associated with it but it only removes something like KYC requirements if the issuer does not add such controls into the smart contract. If North Korea managed to steal like 1% of the MSFT cap table I highly doubt anyone is going to respect the legitimacy of their claim regardless of chain state. I expect a new RWA token would be issued with a corrected allocation approved by a judge and everyone would either be airdropped their updated allocation or would have to claim it through a court approved process. Network tokens like BTC present more unique challenges in this regard than anything like USDC.

Regarding government power, if someone resides in your jurisdiction you can still make any behavior illegal and enforce those laws just by jailing that person regardless of what the chain state is. So if you want to disallow someone from holding US dollars, you just prove that citizen paid someone with a stablecoin, and then fine/jail them if they are breaking that law. Taxation is very similar, you just say how much they owe you and if they don't pay that and you can't directly take it from their account because it's on chain then your remaining option is to jail them. Blockchains reduce the enforcement mechanisms of a government but it doesn't restrict their ability to police behavior on anyone within their jurisdiction. This is a similar state of affairs as how a government already has to contend with enforcement on citizens with foreign bank accounts. It's not legally new and is already a problem at scale.

That leaves us with behaviors the government would like to discourage but isn't willing to criminalize as jailable offenses. A good example is something like jury nullification. The US is unwilling to make jurors legally accountable for a ruling and so jury nullification exists regardless of whether the government likes it. So if there are things the government doesn't like, we need to show benefits of the technology that offset those so the government gridlocks rather than lashing out. As you say:

> Gradual adoption, clear use cases, and integration with existing economic reality buy time and legitimacy.

As we get more powerful US entities such as corporations using blockchains as a sequencing and settlement layer and as we get more international holders of stablecoins driving demand for US treasuries the US is going to be increasingly unlikely to be willing to ban this ecosystem. If they are unwilling to ban this ecosystem this necessarily creates a crack in the door akin to jury nullification because you can't allow this technology and prevent access to ETH. As you say though this is going to be a long negotiation under which I believe we have the eventually winning hand.

TLDR: I think the legal precedence already exists for every problem Ethereum may amplify and the benefits are there to tame government overreaction.

[u/Ok_Budget9461](https://reddit.com/u/Ok_Budget9461):

I largely agree with your framing, especially the idea that blockchain doesn’t remove state power, it mostly changes how that power is exercised. Law enforcement has always targeted people, not ledgers, and that doesn’t disappear just because something is on-chain.

Where I still see friction is at the human layer and the timing, and context matters a lot here.

From a European perspective, many users do feel an increasingly supervisory and revenue-focused approach, especially with frameworks like MiCA, DAC8, and similar regulations. I’m not saying this in an alarmist way — it’s not an outright ban or a direct attack — but it does create a sense of constant oversight that affects behavior.

Legally, as you point out, much of the precedent already exists. In practice, though, the average citizen doesn’t experience “jurisdiction” as an abstract legal concept, but as uncertainty: what’s allowed today, what will change tomorrow, what might be interpreted retroactively. That feeling shapes behavior long before anything is explicitly illegal.

Because of that, even if governments don’t need to ban systems directly, the perception of control and fiscal scrutiny alone is often enough to push people toward familiar, state-backed instruments. Not because they’re better, but because they feel more predictable.

I agree that legitimacy is earned through gradual adoption, clear use cases, and integration with existing economic reality. But that legitimacy also has to be earned with users who don’t want to feel like the “test case” inside a regulatory framework that is still evolving.

So I don’t see this purely as a question of whether states will tolerate financial autonomy, but rather how that autonomy is balanced with regulatory environments that, at least in Europe, are increasingly perceived as restrictive.

Long term, I think your view makes sense. Short term, it’s understandable that most people will continue to choose what feels familiar, tangible, and stable — even if it’s technically inferior.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll talks privacy, sharing a reply to Vitalik's most recent post</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qe818u/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2026/o00lllu/)

Below is my response to Vitalik's latest post in this sub about privacy. ["2026: The year we take back lost ground."](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qer9cy/2026_the_year_that_we_take_back_lost_ground/)

I think there's a general lack of understanding for a lot of people who aren't deep in the privacy space about just how many levels of protection one needs down the tech stack from on-chain to web 2 to the OS level software and then even hardware itself. Depending on your threat model, if you don't have one of these secured, then your privacy is very likely compromised in some way.

I think a lot of people upon realising that, just take on a defeatist attitude since it takes more than just Tornado Cash smart contracts or a privacy focused L2 like Aztec to maintain one's full privacy. But despite being a long road, it's absolutely possible and I think the EF and your own re-focusing on privacy, VB, is a much needed call to action to tackle it once and for all. The tech is here, we just have to build it, make it (relatively) intuitive and make sure users know it is there — if they ever need it.

I think the most important thing about privacy is not necessarily making sure it is used by all by default (would be nice), but making sure it is accessible to all *if they need it*. After all, most people under authoritarian governments don't have something to hide, so much as they wake up one day and they find the government suddenly says something normally benign about them now makes them an enemy of the state. Therefore it's important that they have secure, private alternative technologies to fall back on to keep their lives going until they can get to safety.

Personally, I think the hardware and OS level software side of things is most at risk from snooping authoritarian governments in the long run. Things like Chat Control in the EU and democratic backsliding in the US leaves us with very few places left where companies will be able to create open hardware and software which doesn't have backdoors.

My outlook for the Ethereum side of privacy is good, but I think we're quickly losing the battle for hardware and OS level software. Just look at the way Android is going with their sideloading restrictions. If we lose open source Android or devices with unlocked bootloaders to run custom ROMs on, then mobile is lost (Linux phones just don't have the app support). Living a normal life without a mobile OS is almost impossible these days, so we must defend this critical infrastructure. We are fast running out of time but I appreciate your renewed efforts on the Ethereum side of things.

To anyone reading this, the most you can probably do is to reach out to your representatives any time there is dystopian legislation [like Chat Control](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/) or privacy invasive age restrictions trying to be made into law. That and of course supporting privacy tools on Gitcoin or donating to privacy advocating orgs (like the EFF!) or projects directly.

<summary>u/coregamer90 gives us a rundown of the upcoming RocketPool Saturn 1 upgrade</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qf5ctg/daily_general_discussion_january_17_2026/o03156j/)

I want to give you a heads up for the next Rocketpool upgrade, called Saturn 1, launching on Feb 9th.

It will introduce:

* Megapools: For more gas efficiency, one megapool can store many LEB4's
* LEB4: You only need 4 ETH for one validator, that means better staking APR
* RPL Fee Switch: RPL is optional, but you can stake RPL and get rewarded in ETH

For more info about Saturn 1 take a look here: [https://rp-saturn.webflow.io/](https://rp-saturn.webflow.io/)

There is also a calculator for the RPL Fee-Switsch where you can play around with the parameters: [https://rpl-fee-switch.streamlit.app/](https://rpl-fee-switch.streamlit.app/)

There was also a change in the protocol to prioritize filling up the withdrawal buffer for better liquidity to burn rETH at protocol rate.

<summary>u/Numerous_Ruin_4947 starts an interesting discussion about how hypothetical hyper inflation might affect stablecoins</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qg0myc/daily_general_discussion_january_18_2026/o0d8659/)

**Do stablecoins have a real use case if the USD ever hyperinflates?**

Genuine question. If the unlikely but not impossible scenario of USD hyperinflation happened, would stablecoins still serve a purpose? Most are obviously dollar-pegged, so they’d inherit the same problem.

Could we realistically see stablecoins backed by hard assets instead - like gold, silver, or a basket of commodities - and still function as a medium of exchange? Or does hyperinflation basically force people into non-fiat assets entirely?

Curious how people think this would actually play out in practice.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qht34y/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2026/o0qyi7z/)

Bankless back at pushing narratives that favor their bags.

A year ago they claimed execution was for Solana, DA was for Celestia, consensus and moneyness was for Bitcoin... And that Ethereum was fighting a 3 front war and had to choose.

Ethereum then increases 100% their gas limit, scaled blobs, massively increased its TVL, got a massive bid by DATs... 

Their new narrative tells us they have opened again a position on Solana (maybe through their Bankless Ventures arm?). How can we tell? Well, they are now claiming Solana and Ethereum have a duopoly. 

You heard this right, the cards are dealt guys!  Solana will be the End User/Retail chain, and Ethereum will be the RWA and DeFi chain!  To each his own, don't step out of your lane!!

...

How convenient, right? Specially considering Solana will not ever host RWAs, or DeFi meaningfully. Ethereum is on its way to take the whole thing, but thats obviosuly bad for their bags, so lets pretend they are both equal!

Want more proof? They are now shilling Robinhood's TradFi Bank proposition. Bankless they are called!

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1qht34y/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2026/o0p11c5/)

Do we though? The US-EU alliance is being pissed on by the current admin. Not sure what “worked out” will even mean bc the status quo of trust is gone imo. 

A stepping back from the ledge and a temporary cooling of this tension is possible and maybe even likely- bc both sides *should* be striving for it- but the EU has been foolish to even allow themselves to be in this predicament (cucked at the whim of the US) and I’d imagine they’ll be making every effort going forward to prevent this happening again. 

The World is changing. A lot of people have many opinions on what it’s likely to look like in the future but the changing itself seems to be inevitable. 

NATO was formed in 1949. A POTUS is publicly considering tearing down that geopolitical order that most people haven’t been alive in a world without. That affects war and peace obviously, but also trade, markets, society. 

You’re saying it like it’s obvious that the US and its NATO allies will work this out- *because it’s been previously unthinkable that they wouldn’t.* but it’s also been *previously unthinkable* that the United States would publicly be considering using military force on *Denmark*. The fact that it’s even being discussed. That it has been uttered in public represents a change in the possible outcomes that I honestly haven’t considered before he said it. 

If it happens it isn’t a romp in South America toppling despots. It’s not a “Special Military Operation”, or just another year in the Middle East sandbox. (No offense to people who were personally effected by the events I’m referencing)

It’ll be a turning of the wheel. I don’t usually get political here so I apologize. I’ll put it in ETH terms: 

A market-wide black swan. The worse since at least 2008. You and I can’t even sit here and predict the second and third order effects to economies and markets if this happens.
