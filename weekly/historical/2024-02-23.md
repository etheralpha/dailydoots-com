How do you do fellow digital asset securities investors? I would like to enquire about which registered broker-dealer you use to trade your digital asset securities such as Ethereum and others. I just don't trust these "crypto exchanges" like Coinbase, nor do I trust open source code as you never know when it might fail! Could one of you please recommend me an SEC compliant platform which I can trust to be properly regulated? I only feel comfortable holding crypto under such regulations as anything else makes me worry about a 2007-style collapse.

<summary>u/Distant-Shores celebrates their 1,000th day on-chain!</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1asuvrp/daily_general_discussion_february_17_2024/kqtscvy/)

This week I turn the page on being a 1000 days on chain. I like to share this with you, as I have a lot to thank this community for. 

Getting from CEX to on chain is daunting and feels like stepping into the dark with dangers left and right. 

By lurking on Ethfinance I learned some best practises for basic security and common on chain sense. This made me confident in exploring the early L2's and dApps and qualifiing for, among others, ARB and OP. I got gifted an EVM lion and went on to stake on Gnosis and test for Diva. I rode the 2021 bull hype, and survived the 2022/2023 bear depths and despair.

From time to time I try to contribute here and help others out. 

Thank you Ethfinanciers for having me! May you live long and prosper.

Now onwards to the next 1000 days!

NFT news: Yuga Labs [bought](https://x.com/yugalabs/status/1758583237964947796) the Moonbirds project. They already "own" Bored Apes (which they created), and CryptoPunks (which they bought from Larva Labs).

[u/nothingnotnever](https://reddit.com/u/nothingnotnever):

Moonbirds is CC0 so no one has the copyright to individual NFTs, but Yuga now owns the name and the team. It was an “all stock deal”, no money. The plan is to integrate them into their Otherside metaverse platform. Many apes are pissed as they see it as diluting the ape brand, but Yuga leadership is saying it’s good for all holders in their ecosystem, which includes apes, mutants, cryptopunks, meebits, 10KTF, Kodas, Otherdeeds, HV-MTL, Mara, and doggos. Maybe I missed one.

GM Everyone!  EY Blockchain Summit is back (again).  You can't keep us down :)

Registration is here and we'll do our usual collaboration with EthFinance on Q&A.

This year we're VERY FOCUSED on finance because of the global regulatory convergence going on.  We'll be doing the summit from London with a big focus on Europe's increasing regulatory maturity.

Speakers include the Lord Mayor of London and we've got folks from Fnality, Coinbase and more.  We'll also be showing our newest state-of-the-art privacy tech as well.

[Registration & Agenda (Continuously Updated)](https://web.cvent.com/event/e0ad2c12-3e65-41a9-bafb-a436754cf4ae/websitePage:34e89f81-7647-4dff-b5f8-cd05d75a1ea7)

<summary>u/benido2030 updates the community driven ETH bull case</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr4fcer/)

Some months ago I started to ask for input for a community driven ETH bull case. Today I would like to update it, cause I think the bull market and developments of the past 5 months have changed some of the points we collected back then! 

**Ethereum the network**

* No competition for decentralized programmable blockspace: No alt-L1 is even trying to attack Ethereum by being more decentralized, all L1s are emphasizing speed/ throughput.
* Only credible neutral blockchain/ network: Ethereum's credible neutrality makes Ethereum the only truly trustless ecosystem.
* Ethereum is green since Proof of Stake: Ethereum's energy consumption is down by 99% which is a huge advantage with limited supply and the criticism e.g. Bitcoin faces.
* Ethereum still number 1 for developers: Ethereum is home to developers and hence innovation. New narratives like restaking are still developed by/ for Ethereum.
* The EVM is lindy: By now the Ethereum Virtual Machine is lindy
* Ethereum is the only blockchain/ with multiple clients: Ethereum is the only blockchain which is secured by multiple clients to guarantee liveness.
* Ethereum is finally scaling via Layer 2s: Layer 2s provide sufficient blockspace and result in lower fees for the ecosystem.
* EIP 4844 and protodanksharding: With the Dencun fork and the introduction of blobspace fees will be cut for Layers2 by an order of magnitude allowing for very low transactions cost.
* ETH continues to attract big companies: Companies like PayPal and Visa are developing payment solutions and even nation states are launching CBDC pilots based on the EVM

**Ether the asset**

* ETH as a triple point asset: ETH is covering all major asset classes:
   * ETH is a capital asset: Staked ETH allows you to collect a share of Ethereum's fees and produces cash flow.
   * ETH as Store of Value and Money: ETH is a great collateral and money e.g. in the NFT market.
   * ETH is needed for transactions: Since ETH is used to pay for gas fees, it is a consumable - and from previous cycles we know that people are willing to pay a lot for ETH's blockspace.
* ETH leaves CEXes and price discovery still happens on CEXes. Leaving ETH means that sell pressure goes down.
* Demand more ETH keeps going up, projects like Eigenlayer (but also Blast etc.) are like a black hole that takes ETH out of the liquid supply and locks it in smart contracts. LRTs can't make up for that.
* Restaking exports ETHs security and makes it a central asset beyond the Ethereum network and ecosystem
* ETH as a deflationary asset: Since the merge about 0.25% of the circulating ETH supply has been burned and ETH is deflationary. During a bull run the amount of ETH burned is likely even higher, leading to a supply shock and a ETH prices skyrocketing.
* ETH has yield: Since withdrawals were introduced, staking is as close to risk free as it gets and so is the yield. This narrative is unique, both in crypto, but also in traditional finance and will lead to increased demand from all kinds of institutions.
* The ETH ETF is coming. The BTC ETF seems to have surprised to the upside, net flows are way higher than people expected. The ETH ETF could come as soon as May and will be the only other ETF for this cycle.

I have deleted one bullet (that talks about nation state demand) and have exchanged it basically with the ETF , cause at this point this seems like a plausible narrative and all institutions could buy ETH that way. On top I have added new demand drivers like Eigenlayer and the effects it already had and will have.

I am sure there is more, so keep it coming if you think there should be more added!

<summary>u/hanniabu is back to building cool things, this time for Farcaster users</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr61w60/)

After creating my farcaster account, I realized there wasn't a way to easily share your handle in a frontend-agnostic way so i created [https://mycaster.xyz](https://mycaster.xyz).

With Mycaster you can easily create a share link which will redirect to whichever frontend the person opening the link uses.

**How does it work?**

The person that wants to share their account enters their farcaster handle and selects Generate Link. This will automatically copy the link to clipboard so you can share it.

For the people that click your link, they can select their preferred frontend to be redirected to. Their selection will be remembered and automatically forward them the next time they use a MyCaster share link.

Try it out! [https://mycaster.xyz/?p=hanniabu](https://mycaster.xyz/?p=hanniabu)

<summary>u/benido2030 introduces EthFinance's 3 $STRK delegates</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr41wnr/)

The day has (almost) finally arrived, Starknet has announced the $STRK token will be launched and airdropped tomorrow. If you are part of the airdrop: Congratz! 

Now some of you will probably dump it and that's okay. But for those that will keep it, you probably know that you will have to make a decision soon, because $STRK is a governance token and so you will have to pick a delegate. In the past couple of weeks and months we have found three delegates that would like to represent the community within the starknet ecosystem:

- u/atleft: You can find their [starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/515ad8e2-8b42-440c-b0ea-0f09a46557a6)
- u/\_weboftrust: You can find their [starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/50b1e132-b38c-4c44-8c40-021f950e276b)
- u/panthoreon: You can find their [starknet delegate profile here](https://governance.starknet.io/delegates/profile/13178099-69db-4c6c-87d7-5d2861ee6615)

While atleft and \_weboftrust are delegates already (governance was kicked off even before the token was airdropped, they both got $STRK delegated by the starknet foundation), panthoreon is a new delegate. You can find a little more info about that [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1971kkf/comment/khy6tvo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Panthoreon shared some thoughts, insights and motivation [here](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1amhanj/comment/kpmn520/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

So when you claim and delegate, keep these three names / delegates in mind. The goal is that all three delegates are open to listening to your feedback and vote based on comments and discussions happening on reddit. So instead of delegating to some maybe famous name from CT, that will probably not take your opinion and arguments into account, I think it would be beautiful if some of us delegated to "our delegates".

<summary>u/benido2030 explains StarkNet for anyone out of the loop</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1avafsm/daily_general_discussion_february_20_2024/kr9vuft/)

Starknet is one of the very few non-EVM layer2s. The other very famous ones (OP, ARB, zksync, etc.) are (zk)EVMs. So it is unique in that sense, users need a different wallet and hence the UX is different than what we "usually" see. This is also true for developers, since they need to develop in Cairo, the programming language for Starknet. Because of that (almost?) all apps you can use on starknet are starknet-only since it's not easy to bring e.g. Uniswap or AAVE to Starknet. 

I believe there are only smart contract wallets. Account abstraction is natively built into Starknet. Also STRK can be used to pay gas in the future.

<summary>u/baerbelleksa reminds those receiving an airdrop to take a moment to think about helping others</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1aug4kx/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2024/kr807ln/)

now that ETH's nearing $3K, consider sharing some wealth to help folks in need 💗

Seeds: Crypto Mutual Aid is on Juicebox:

[https://juicebox.money/v2/p/624](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/624)

If unfamiliar, Seeds has helped folks in need in 29 countries & counting.  Because DeFi, the ecosystem can successfully offer aid where tradfi and traditional aid fail.

\*\*

One example:

Kana Piath, a schoolchild in South Sudan, couldn't afford to continue elementary school, so her grandmother redeemed a SEED to ask for help.

The Seeds community got them the funds they needed so she could continue school.

They sent a thank you note that said Kana was so excited she ran to school at 6 am the first day back to catch up with her friends. :)
