Historic transfer of wealth from early ETH whales to treasury companies. Or vice versa, depending on how you define wealth.

Either way, this must be good for bitcoin.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains to us how Ethereum is a revolutionary new engine</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mw1tq5/daily_general_discussion_august_21_2025/n9z1582/)

An engine in a traditional sense is a device that converts potential energy of any form to mechanical energy. A more modern definition of an engine might be anything that converts something into a more usable form. For example graphics engines turn the data about a scene into a pretty picture for you. I want to discuss the application of blockchains as capital engines.

Money, in its least corrupt implementation, is essentially a claim upon the effort of others. We tend to think of credit cards as our debt but even cash in your pocket represents a debt from society to you that you can settle by claiming various services from others. Money in that sense is like potential energy and the conversion of money to mechanical action is the action of an engine.

As with energy, money can take many forms. We denominate our net worth in many things. There's the balance of our bank account, the value of our brokerage account, the value of our land, our house, etc. Some of these forms of capital are more liquid than others but all of them store value in the same way heat or an electric field can both store energy.

Also as with energy, every time you touch it you tend to lose some due engine inefficiencies. Every bit of noise and heat radiating from your combustion engine is energy loss. Of course, some engines are more efficient than others and are suitable for different purposes.

Blockchains and specifically the Dexs running on them are a capital engine. They convert capital from one form to another. Where this is differentiated from previous capital engines is the conversion process is both faster and more efficient than previous engines. Sending fiat overseas on Tradfi rails can take weeks and take fees of several percent. Sending a stablecoin on a blockchain can be sub-second and take negligible fees. This difference can be incredibly transformative for how people store and interact with money.

What this new financial engine enables is for everyone to store their wealth in both more productive and more liquid forms. Because the settlement times are so low you can store value in any capital form you want without risking overdraft fees, declined credit cards, and missed payment penalties. You can store your value in a more productive form such as a local bond or a dividend stock rather than USD. This should of course scare the shit out of banks. All the capital you have to over-allocate to your checking account at sub-market rates is the source of what they can lend out and the source of their multi-billion profits per year.

A combination of yield bearing tokens and dexs enables everyone to store capital in whatever they want while accessing it as needed and transmitting it to a receiver in whatever form *they* want. Bitcoin maxi's want to believe Bitcoin is going to be the new reserve currency of the world. What I find more likely is that smart contracts are going to enable everyone to make an independent decision on what their personal reserve currency is. They could of course use tokenized treasury bills as their store of value but if they want to use MSFT shares as their reserve currency they'll be able to once tokenized stocks are launched. If they want to use tokenized mortgages they can do that too. This new capital engine ultimately enables personal choice and freedom in an unprecedented way.

At this point adoption is as inevitable as any revolutionary engine would be. There's no denying the physics here, regardless of the will of the banks. We're now in a state of the financial institutions racing to adopt this faster than their competitors rather than just hoping to suppress it. The news of this is everywhere: in the words of the Federal Reserve, in the speeches from the SEC, in the legislation being passed, in the investor notes for every financial institution, in every slide deck I've reviewed from Tradfi this year. We hear news echoes of this day by day and the price doesn't seem respond to it so it's natural to downplay it. But this basically the hottest thing being talked about in finance technology right now and no one is talking about it on a basis of whether it is going to happen but instead how to position themselves for the inevitability of this. I do hope you have your seat already. Believe in SomETHing.

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth discusses what the EU might do regarding stablecoins vs a CBDC</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mwxjkf/daily_general_discussion_august_22_2025/na1gn9j/)

According to FT/Financial Times:

"EU officials are increasingly worried that the U.S. law will enhance the dominance of dollar-denominated tokens, necessitating a digital euro to maintain the euro’s position in the global market"

The officials won't clarify what would be the technical approach to this. Remember, this is enough for most of the crypto related news shites to tell you this will be built on Ethereum or some other chain.

Don't fall for it. For now Europe has been way more keen on the CBDC approach in which trust lies solely on the European Central Bank.

Having Europe trusting Ethereum would be bullish as hell, but it's all too far away from European values. Remember their European Parliament is the same one trying to create encryption backdoors for all chat apps in all European countries.

<summary>u/epic_trader thinks about the chances of a certain blockchain being the most valuable in the long run</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mwxjkf/daily_general_discussion_august_22_2025/na17jmx/)

Every day I wake up I think to myself "what are the chances that the world's first proof of concept blockchain, which can facilitate 7 transactions per seconds, has 10 minute block times and requires 3 block confirmations, which is vulnerable to quantum computers, pollutes as much as a small country, which can't be upgraded because the community opposes it and isn't actually used for much. What are the chances that this blockchain is going to be the most valuable blockchain forever?" and I always find there's exactly a 0% chance that is going to be the case. It's hard to believe until it happens, but it is going to happen, Ethereum will flip Bitcoin and it will dwarf it and it will make sense to everyone when it happens.

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth explains the nature of the DAO hack fix and what constitutes network downtime</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mymstj/daily_general_discussion_august_24_2025/nahke35/)

Can't tell if you are baiting.

The DAO hack resulted in no downtime and no rollback. A smart contract state was modified as part of the fix which, at best, constitutes the same as a hard fork. All other transactions continued.

From said hard fork two versions of the chain moved on because it was a contended decision, now known as ETC and ETH. 

The rest of the hard forks of the chain, the latest being Pectra, also resulted in no downtime.

Or in simpler terms: there was no point in time in which the Ethereum chain stopped being able to process transactions. That is: no downtime.

Other chains have examples of downtime: 
- Bitcoin had its last downtime in 2013 (Chain Split Bug) and 2010 (Value Overflow bug). Downtime was on the minutes
- Ethereum: No event, no length recorded. 
- Solana: February 2024, length unknown. Before that October 2022 (6 hours), May 31st 2022 (4.5h) and many more (May 1st, 2022; September 2021...)

Bitcoin has had a great run, but no lack of incidents. And did not go through a migration from PoW to PoS.

<summary>u/aaqy explains how Solana's transactions actually take longer than Ethereum's despite its shorter block time</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mzhmpp/daily_general_discussion_august_25_2025/naldyj5/)

So I was looking at Solana stats on this [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/scarn_eth/solana-tx-fail-rate), and apparently about 25% of transactions fail. So even though Solana blocks are produced very fast (\~0.4s per block), a transaction is usually only considered confirmed after \~2s, once enough validators have signed it. Combine that with 12s for a human using a hardware wallet to send it, and the average transaction ends up taking longer than Ethereum’s \~24s (12s human/hardware + 12s expected wait for inclusion in a block).

Here’s roughly how it works. Let's say a normal successful transaction takes 12s for a human using a hardware wallet to send and 2s to be confirmed, so 14s total. If the first try fails, you spend 14s, notice it about 4s later, resend, and wait 2s for confirmation, giving 32s for that transaction.

Now, to compute the average transaction time, including possible retries, we can use the geometric series with a 25% failure rate:

    Attempt n | Prob P_n      | Time T_n (s)
    -----------------------------------------
    1         | 0.75          | 14
    2         | 0.1875        | 46
    3         | 0.046875      | 78
    4         | 0.01171875    | 110
    5+        | <0.01         | >142
    
The expected time is:

    E[T] = Σ (P_n * T_n) 
         ≈ 0.75*14 + 0.1875*46 + 0.046875*78 + 0.01171875*110 + ... 
         ≈ 24.65 s

So on average, Solana transactions in this case would take about 24.65s, slightly longer than Ethereum’s \~24s.

Next, for the variance / standard deviation, we compute the contributions of each attempt:

    Attempt n | Prob P_n      | Time T_n (s) | (T_n - E[T])^2 * P_n
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    1         | 0.75          | 14            | 0.75*(14 - 24.65)^2 ≈ 85.067
    2         | 0.1875        | 46            | 0.1875*(46 - 24.65)^2 ≈ 85.467
    3         | 0.046875      | 78            | 0.046875*(78 - 24.65)^2 ≈ 133.417
    4         | 0.01171875    | 110           | 0.01171875*(110 - 24.65)^2 ≈ 85.350
    5+        | <0.01         | >142          | negligible

Sum ≈ 389.3; including all terms gives Var\[T\] ≈ 455.11, so the standard deviation is σ ≈ 21.33s. For comparison, Ethereum’s standard deviation is around 6s, so Solana is way more unpredictable.

And again, these are just averages. During congestion, Solana can reject **up to 75% of transactions**, making the user experience terrible exactly when the network is most needed.

All this shows that the “faster blocks = better UI” idea is totally misleading. Fast blocks don’t matter if a quarter or more of transactions fail, and even more during congestion. 

Ethereum may have slower blocks, but it’s way more predictable and reliable for humans using hardware wallets.

<summary>After 4 years, u/superphiz finally gets around to finishing preparations for the $5K POAP</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mzhmpp/daily_general_discussion_august_25_2025/nanxb3x/)

I'm really proud that we fended off $5k again, it really shows the strength of our community when we can focus on fundamentals without getting obsessed with some arbitrary number. 

I want to clarify a few things about the distribution of the $5k POAP: my intention is that we will wait until 24 hours AFTER $5k and then harvest a list of addresses for anyone who donated an equivalent of $10 to any historical ethstaker.eth address, on mainnet or a layer 2.

At that point, we'll collect addresses THEN give a 24 hour dispute period (possibly longer) where you can file a dispute as a github issue if you believe you were accidentally omitted, you'll need to include a txid in that issue if you think you found a problem. IF you made a mistake, it's on you, and I'm sorry - we don't plan on sending POAPs where users sent an erroneous transaction, this is really just to limit the customer service load. If in doubt, check your donation before the dispute period.

AFTER we feel confident that the list is correct, we'll forward that list to POAP for an airdrop. I've asked that they send POAPs directly to wallets without a claim process since the requirement was only "send $10 to EthStaker".

I never made a big show of this, but I parted with EthStaker a few years ago, but I continue to support any actors who seek to decentralize Ethereum. That's just a way of saying that this doesn't benefit me AT ALL, I'm just here to support [and troll] the community.

[Here](https://github.com/EvilJordan/POAP5k) is where you'll find the list of recipients when it's complete. DO NOT harass Jordan if your name isn't on the list yet, it's currently just a proof of concept. If you have desperate concerns about the list now, please reach out directly to /u/superjiz.

[This is the OP](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qkxqge/daily_general_discussion_november_2_2021/hj1082t/) that describes what's going on. Notice that this is from four years ago, when I initially proposed the $5k POAP,  and it has been a fun part of our community since then.

<summary>u/InsideTheSimulation gives us the lore behind EVMavs NFTs getting verified on OpenSea</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n0d0o1/daily_general_discussion_august_26_2025/naqwigb/)

In case anyone missed it, EVMs finally got verified on OpenSea. All it took was IcoBeast getting tattooed on some guy’s ass. 

Years of effort trying to submit in a way they’d approve. Multiple DAO votes, multisig transfers, trust placed in single members to complete the submission process and transfer back — only to get stonewalled by OpenSea at the end. 

And they go and do it because of an ass tattoo. 

Unmatched lore. 😂

[u/epic_trader](https://reddit.com/u/epic_trader):

As far as I know there's talk about pushing the gas limit towards 150 million gas per block after the Fusaka hardfork late this year, where today the max is 45 million with a target of 22,5 million. This is going to happen incrementally so it's not like an instant increase, but probably will happen over several months.

Blobs which carry L2 data will also be increased to as many as 48, where today the max is 9 and the target is 6, so very substantial increase both for L1 and especially L2.

<summary>u/haurog has an update for Gnosis card holders which he helped to create</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n185o4/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2025/naxc3wk/)

If you are a validator on gnosis chain and use a gnosis pay card, you can now automatically refill your card directly with your staking rewards from the official gnosis consolidate website. Go to consolidate.gnosischain.com, connect your withdrawal address, click on the hamburger menu in the top right (the three lines) and configure the autoclaim registry. As far as I remember you have to sign 3 messages (register your gnosis pay address, approve the GNO and the autoclaim schedule). And from then on it claims your staking rewards, swaps them for EURe and transfers them to your gnosis pay card account. I think the transaction happens around midnight CEST (UTC+2).

A large part of this is actually my code. I wrote this feature a bit more than 1.5 years ago mostly for fun (<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1agwsik/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2024/kokasno/>). The gnosis people liked it very much and asked me about it at Devcon last year. In January they audited my code and found some places which needed improvement if they want to roll it out for all their users. The most critical part was my implementation of a 'poor mans sandwich protection'. I wrote about it in my description as well (<https://hackmd.io/@haurog/Sk9Mzj2vp>). The official implementation now uses chainlink oracles to prevent sandwiching and added a few proxy layers to make it easier to handle many users. Nice to see that my code has been deployed on chain by gnosis.

<summary>u/InsuranceGuyQuestion explains Ethereum's monetary policy</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n185o4/daily_general_discussion_august_27_2025/nax06xh/)

What makes ETH so unique is it adjusts its net inflation depending on usage. Burn when busy, inflate when quiet. So ETH isn’t aiming for a fixed 1-2%; instead, it floats around equilibrium based on network usage.

---

Why ETH won’t go hyper-inflationary:

Post-Merge issuance is tiny: only \~0.5% new ETH per year (to validators).

Even if the network went completely inactive (no burn at all), the most inflation you’d see is \~0.5-0.7% annually, nowhere close to “hyper.”


Why ETH won’t go hyper-deflationary:

For ETH to burn a massive share of supply, gas fees would have to stay extremely high for a very long time.

At peak mania (NFT/DeFi boom), burn exceeded issuance by a lot, but that only made ETH mildly deflationary (like -0.5% to -1% annually).

Structural demand caps (block size limits, fee markets) prevent ETH from burning so much that supply spirals down quickly.

---

ETH’s monetary policy is designed to hover in a narrow band around 0% net issuance, depending on how much people use the network. 

That’s very different from:

Bitcoin = fixed supply, eventually strictly deflationary in issuance.

Fiat = flexible supply, but subject to political decisions (can inflate a lot).

So yes, like you said, it’s fair to assume ETH will stay close to 0-1%. This is one of the reasons why the technology is so incredible, and why some people even argue that ETH is money because it functions as one of the best forms of money we’ve seen.

<summary>u/whisperedstate sparks discussion over skepticism of Googles L1</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n23eta/comment/nb4jx8b/)

How is Google going to launch their own L1? Don't they need to launch their own token if they want a credibly neutral, permisionless chain? If they are going the permisionned route, with "trusted" validators, then why would anyone use this thing with any significant value? 

I don't understand the grift here. Why would you build out your own validation network with significant overhead, when you can get the exact same result (permissioned defi chain, custom execution) with an L2 without any of the overhead?
