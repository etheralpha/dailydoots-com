[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kfxejq/daily_general_discussion_may_06_2025/mqvi7ow/)

I know exactly why ETH price is dropping. Apparently there was a serious bug in its only execution client that would have allowed unlimited token mints. Fucking disaster. It was secretly patched by core devs and coordinated in discord channel with the handful of validators that control the network…..………oh….wait

<summary>u/ReptilePotato starts a discussion about tokenisation with no mention of Ethereum despite Ethereum's involvement</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kctwdl/daily_general_discussion_may_02_2025/mq5m306/)

Man it is so annoying to still see so many news articles and social media posts hype up tokenization and stablecoins but then they mention 'crypto' or even say #BTC lmao...

And then on social media there will be a rare comment saying the word 'ethereum' or 'built on Ethereum' and have like no upvotes or is burried down where no one will see it. 

I bet this would bring in some positive narrative if they would actually start naming ethereum. Or if some influential people would comment that it's built on Ethereum on all these posts. 

I tried commenting but sadly i am a nobody and i don't get upvotes or views. (not sharing my twitter here)

Hiya! 

Would love a favour from the community here, I've been indexing all the .eth sites with content at [foreversearch.io](https://foreversearch.io)

I've done the latest 500k blocks and now going further back.

I introduced a upvote style system where you can effectively sign a message to upvote a site (no fees, no gas), and a wallet can only upvote a site once and must meet some.health metrics (more than 10 days old, more than 0.02 ETH - to prevent spam).

Would love you guys to check it out and throw some votes on any sites you find interesting! 

Like the original internet, lots of random fun stuff haha - [foreversearch.io](https://foreversearch.io) (or foreversearch.eth)

<summary>u/Stobie covers the critical vulnerability in Solana which they tried to sweep under the rug</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kecwko/daily_general_discussion_may_04_2025/mqig524/)

There was a critical vulnerability on solana and a supermajority of validators colluded to patch it, they did it twice and no one knew anything about it. [https://solana.com/news/post-mortem-may-2-2025](https://solana.com/news/post-mortem-may-2-2025) . It's totally misleading to even call it a blockchain, if they can do that there's effectively a masternode and a government/group can force other changes the same way.

r/cc front page be like:

**Post:** ETH price is down  
**Top comment:** Price down for years now, so it’ll keep going down. ETH is dying.

**Post:** Current ETH/BTC ratio is historically bullish  
**Top comment:** Past performance isn’t an indicator of future results.

This shit is botted for sure. Stay safe out there everyone.

[u/Numerous_Ruin_4947](https://reddit.com/u/Numerous_Ruin_4947):

You can unbot it with your own postive posts. Always turn the topic around to how great Ethereum is. Saylor claimed last year that ETH would never get a Spot ETF and that it would be declared a security by the SEC by summertime. He was wrong, and when confronted, he claimed it was a great thing for Bitcoin. He did not hesitate to make it all about Bitcoin again.

I posted this reply about 47 minutes ago in CC  - see the BTC maxi's comment in quotes:

> But BTC price has gone up by 38,000% so miners rewards are more than enough.

ETH is up 152,000% since 2015. And it will go up a lot more. Like BTC, it is a great store-of-value but also offers staking yield as an elegant solution to secure the chain and its transactions. This gives Ethereum greater economic security than Bitcoin. Ethereum has certainty of security, and BTC does not.

Bunch of recent regen/ReFi news

- Silvi Protocol launched [Treekipidia](https://x.com/SilviProtocol/status/1915172686621258198) - *"There’s tons of tree data out there—scientific papers, databases like GBIF and iNaturalist, and even digital encyclopedias like Wikipedia—but it’s not easily machine-readable, queryable and programmable. Using AI and blockchain, Treekipedia changes that. It makes tree data and knoweldge programmable, helping automate reforestation strategies, project tree impact, and unify protocols with shared data."*

- Kokonut Network is officially moving on [Kokonut Adelphi](https://x.com/KokonutNetwork/status/1914757318673048056), a Nounish Syntropic Farm. Protocol Guild [recently tweeted](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild/status/1917586010390814885) about the 10 ETH they got from the same Public Nouns 2 years ago. P-Nouns have [funded a lot of public goods](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote) and more people should really be aware of it.

* Regen Network, an OG Cosmos ecocredit validator/chain, is partnering with Celo - [Twitter space](https://x.com/regen_network/status/1915450705340711078) and can see what credits are actually on the market on [RegenAtlas](https://www.regenatlas.xyz/)

<summary>u/accidental_green updated their open source validator updater</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kf4j0p/daily_general_discussion_may_05_2025/mqpfx5m/)

I updated my open source validator updater to make it the easiest and fastest way to update all Ethereum clients (including MEV).

Github: [https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-updater)

Simply run a single command and the application will open to show you the currently installed versions and the latest available. Just click "Update Validator" and the program will install the latest versions.

I believe this is the easiest and most user friendly way to update for home stakers, and works will all standard setups using /usr/local/bin (Somer Esat, Coincashew, etc).

CLI version is still available for those who do not have a GUI or prefer a simpler program

Feel free to check out my other tools like [validator-install](https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install) and [client-switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher). Any testing or feedback is always appreciated!

Don't forget you only have 2 days left to update!

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard points out the fundamentals of Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kfxejq/daily_general_discussion_may_06_2025/mqwuy49/)

Have you by chance been following [the adoption news](https://ethereumadoption.com/)? Are you following the signs of institutional adoption such as BUIDL growing 187% in the past 30 days? How about Blackrock's plan to bring another $150B on chain? Or maybe news of the Texas stock exchange or plans by Robinhood to tokenize private equity investments you can't buy on the NYSE? How about RWA growth? RWA TVL is up 175% YTD. Stablecoin growth? EURC is up over 200% YTD.

Maybe you'd be a fan of all [the chain metric growth](https://www.growthepie.xyz/)? We're up about 300% transaction volume YTD. We have Pectra coming tomorrow which will increase capacity even further to support onboarding even more applications and institutions.

So if you invested in the impact of the chain, adoption by Tradfi and revolution of the finance system, stablecoin adoption to bring financial services to billions of underserved people, anti-tyranny technology to help people escape their local mismanaged currencies, then it has been a fantastic investment.

If you are investing trying to frontrun the whims of retail, then you're welcome to invest in Fartcoin. You would have done better. But I'll at least ask you this, if you had invested in Fartcoin and then were down as much as your ETH holdings right now how would you feel compared to investing in something showing amazing growth and impact and being down the same amount?

<summary>u/spupul6 highlights the 10 most bullish things happening in Ethereum right now</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kfxejq/daily_general_discussion_may_06_2025/mqvwpvy/)

OK guys, I have to say it, I'm really fucking bullish. There is so many things happening in the background its hard to collect them.

**1) ETH is still the best asset.** The ultra sound meme was misguided, it should have never been about eth being deflationary, the main focus should have been that it is **sustainable**. ETH is the only asset which is balancing the tug of war between validator payments and asset inflation, and the result is a perfect combo, where even in low activity times validators get paid, while keeping the net inflation around zero (since merge). In the end only those assets can be SoV's which can stand the test of time, and here we have a timeless mashine + a massive economy behind it.

**2) The istitutional adoption is just crazy.** L2's spun up every other week, RWA, Stablecoins going parabolic and most of it is on ethereum. Props to Hanniabu for the [https://ethereumadoption.com/](https://ethereumadoption.com/) website.

**3) Pectra is awesome, and we are getting it tomorrow.** 2X blobcount, UX improvements, validator improvements, all very useful. Also [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) allows for a \~2X gaslimit increase on L1 not too soon after Pectra.

**4) Devs are in warmode.** A lot of people are compaining that they are shipping slowly, but personally I don't see this. If we look in the past we got pretty complex hardforks \~every year and there were so many things built in parralel, that I think we are staring to see the fruit of it. For example they target a 6 month cadence for future upgrades, and Fusaka with peerdas can come as soon as October.

**5) Open intents framework is coming with improved L2 interop.** I don't think this needs to much explanation, L2 interopability is very much needed,and the reality is that we don't have to wait too much for that.

**6)Blob pricing will get solved in Fusaka.** [EIP-7918](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7918-blob-base-fee-bounded-by-execution-cost/23271) or [eip-7762](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7762) in Fusaka we finally will get a better pricing for blobs, no more free meals.

**7) L1 scaling is coming.** Due to the recent and future upgrades we will have some headspace to increase blocksize, devs targeting 150m for Fusaka, 300m for glamsterdam. Increasing capacity, reducing the gaslimit for the burn.

**8) UX improvements with smart wallets.** Guys, this will be huge. Pectra with EIP-7702 will bring a new era of user experience. The transaction batches are just the beginning, can't wait to set different wallet recovery methods, automate DCA or payments. I guess addon's which can calculate the exact tax amount you have to pay according to your accomodation and automatically send it to a different wallet are not too far away either. [This looks like an interesting wallet I found today](https://x.com/otimlabs/status/1899508344299389307) or [https://otim.com/](https://otim.com/) ready for pectra!

**9) ZK teams are on fire. Sub-12s proving times are coming in 2-3 months.** The sheer amount of teams working on zk is astonishing. In the recent ethproofs call most of these teams set a 2-6 month timeline to reach real time proving. This on itself doesn't solve but it enables L2 composability.  [Ethproofs twitter](https://x.com/eth_proofs/status/1916040446419128775?s=12)

**10) We still have decent activity despite bear market prices.**  L1+L2 activity still on the rise, while we have not seen serious wealth generation event on ethereum this cycle so far unlike on solana. When prices start trending again and money is to be made the degens and activity will come back to an improved UX and increased capacity.

Improvements come in waves, there are times where it looks like nothing is happening and then suddenly everything changes at once. I believe we are right before an explosion in usability and interest.

<summary>u/barthib covers Pectra boosting Ethereum ahead of Solana</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kgq8a7/daily_general_discussion_may_07_2025/mr1ofmm/)

So from now on the Ethereum ecosystem can process about 700 TPS, right?

That's 2× Solana's real TPS. Not even talking about greater Ethereum's security through a decentralisation designed more seriously than Solana's, lower ETH's inflation through a supply emission designed more neutrally than Solana's, perfect Ethereum's network stability through a queuing mechanism and hardware requirements that match the real world better than Solana's fantasies. Ah and also now even cheaper than the cheaper we were already for months...

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kgq8a7/daily_general_discussion_may_07_2025/mr23ebk/)

Just copy/pasting the whole text from [GregtheGreek](https://x.com/gregthegreek/status/1920068405094121498?t=MpmB0Tauoqk8QCJkC2sMGA&s=19) on X, because this is very important/useful..

Pectra PSA 🚨

Now that Pectra is live as a user of large funds, in the earliest of days we need to navigate things carefully.

Instead of fear mongering, I want to provide some very concrete guidelines on how to stay safe :)

**Risk Profiles**
- Users of hardware wallets
- Custom KMS solutions 
- New or non-industry-leading wallets

**The Risk**

With 7702 (type 4 txs) you can very easily be drained by a malicious website. 

**The How**

A type 4 tx can upgrade your wallet to have smart account functionality, but the code that gets used can be arbitrary.

If I were a malicious website, I would have users sign an upgrade, letting me sign away everything. If I were really malicious, I would wait to see if you move a large amount of funds into the wallet at a later time! 

The alternative is also having you sign away assets the same way you could sweep an account with a Gnosis Safe or any other normal 4337 account! Be careful verify transactions!

**Protecting Yourself**

*Extension Users*

Use a reputable extension provider, such as MetaMask, Rabby, Rainbow, etc... The main reason is that they will outright block type 4 transactions being signed unless its done directly via their UI. They want to protect you, depending on who you pick you will most likely get some form of proprietary 4337 compatible solution.

*Hardware wallet users*

Proxy through a reputable wallet team, such as the list I provided above. Never connect directly to an app via the "ledger/trezor" direct connection. A website could bypass security guarantees that the wallet teams implement natively. If you let an app sign away a type 4, you better be quick to try and reverse it ASAP. Simply put, always proxy through a reputable wallet/extension that they want to help. 

*Simulate, Simulate, Simulate*

Thankfully simulation tools like tenderly are available, and even most wallet teams deploy simulations natively in the transaction review phase. Make sure you're using the app you know, make sure you look at the amount of funds being transferred, and finally make sure it's only moving what you expect to move.

**Final Note**

7702 will fundamentally improve our lives; it's just in these earliest days that we have the highest risk profile.
