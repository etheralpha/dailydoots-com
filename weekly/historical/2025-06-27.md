[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ljwzdx/comment/mzqg2z9/)

Ethereum's violent pumps are fueled by the tears of r/ethereum users.

The tear tank is filling up, but not fast enough to hard boil The Crab. We need April/May levels of drama, hysteria, and desperation for it to take off.

So based on my state-of-the-art sensors we'll reach those levels of pain by mid-July to consolidate a rally to 5k by mid-August.

It is known. It is written. Giveth.

<summary>u/SeaMonkey82 shares a cool validator consolidation tool and shares his process for securely upgrading withdrawal credentials</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lgoi1m/daily_general_discussion_june_21_2025/mz2ew8u/)

A couple of days ago, I posted a link to the [pectra-cli tool](https://github.com/Luganodes/pectra-cli) for airgapped validator withdrawal credential management and consolidation.  I thought I'd share some notes from my experience with it.  This is not intended as a replacement for carefully reading all documentation.
  
My airgapped environment is [Tails](https://tails.net/), so the only things that persist are the files stored in persistent storage.  With this configuration, here is the workflow:  

[Manually upgrade your Tails to the current version.](https://tails.net/upgrade/tails/index.en.html)  pectra-cli requires a modern libc version.
  
**On your online node,** 

    git clone https://github.com/Luganodes/pectra-cli.git
    cd pectra-cli
    go build -o pectra-cli ./cmd/main.go
    cp internal/config/abi.json .

All of the above is covered in the documentation.  However, in order to utilize `sign.go` for offline signing, there are some dependencies that need to be present prior to copying everything to your airgapped environment.  I followed the documentation [here](https://gist.github.com/gmolveau/f09c1038ca622620e54d0579ba06ea96#file-golang_offline-md) to do this.  
  
    mkdir vendor
    cd vendor
    go mod init test

Use your preferred editor to create `offline_modules.go` within the vendor folder, and paste the following:  
  
    package offline_modules
    
    import (
      "encoding/hex"
      "encoding/json"
      "fmt"
      "log"
      "os"
    
      "github.com/Luganodes/Pectra-CLI/internal/config"
      "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/types"
      "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp"
    )
    
    func main() {}
  
Then run  

    cd ..
    go mod vendor
    cp sample_config.json config.json

Edit config.json with your preferred editor.  Keep in mind that if your goal is to consolidate many validators into one, only the target validator needs to be switched to `0x02` type.  All `0x01` type can be consolidated into `0x02`.
  
At this point, you can generate your unsigned transactions for `switch` and `consolidate`.  Take care to rename the `unsigned_tx.json` if you generate both so you can discern between `switch` and `consolidate` transactions.  Also, note that somewhat confusingly, the `--airgapped` (`-a`) flag is used to generate the unsigned transactions on your *online* node.  

    ./pectra-cli switch -c config.json -a
    mv unsigned_tx.json unsigned_switch.json
    ./pectra-cli consolidate -c config.json -a
    mv unsigned_tx.json unsigned_consolidate.json

Copy the pectra-cli folder along with the [latest version of go](https://go.dev/doc/install) to your freshly formatted flash drive.  
  
**On your airgapped machine,**  

Boot into Tails and enable the administrator password option prior to startup.  
  
Install Go.  
`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz`  
  
Edit `/home/amnesia/.profile` and append the following to the end:  
`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`  
  
Re-load the profile.  
`source /home/amnesia/.profile`  
  
Navigate to the pectra-cli folder and sign your transactions.  

    go run scripts/sign.go unsigned_switch.json  
    mv signed_tx.json signed_switch.json  
    go run scripts/sign.go unsigned_consolidate.json
    mv signed_tx.json signed_consolidate.json  
  
Copy the signed transactions to your flash drive.  
  
**On your online node,**  
  
Broadcast the switch transaction.  
`./pectra-cli broadcast -f signed_switch.json -c config.json`
  
WAIT UNTIL YOUR TARGET VALIDATOR WITHDRAWAL CREDENTIALS ARE CONFIRMED TO BE `0X02` ON CHAIN!  You can check the status easily on [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in).  
  
Broadcast the consolidate transaction.  
`./pectra-cli broadcast -f signed_consolidate.json -c config.json`  
  
Please feel free to respond with errors, omissions, or any difficulties you might have.  Of course, I take no responsibility for loss of funds if you mess things up.

<summary>u/-lightfoot delivers a RAI dollar update</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lfvltk/daily_general_discussion_june_20_2025/myrrz31/)

[Just the treasury secretary going on about stablecoins and RAI-dollar hyping it up. Normal stuff.](https://xcancel.com/rai_dollar/status/1935711093646647394#m)

As an update, RAI dollar aims to launch in 6-8 months. Shortly after it does, 7% of its total token supply will be auctioned off in another â€˜altarâ€™, to competing bids of FLX. The winning bidsâ€™ FLX will be burned. 

So HAI and RAI dollar will _both_ be having auctions that create significant FLX buy pressure while reducing total supply ðŸš€ 

Itâ€™s also now looking extremely likely that FLX will become stakeable for a share of RAIv2 protocol revenue, while v2 also enables some LSDs to be used as collateral, and thereâ€™s a proposed FLX buyback with some of the recently recovered $1.5m being discussed.

Honestly so excited about RAI and the RAI/HAI/RAI-dollar ecosystem â€˜Money God Leagueâ€™. FLX is going to become so much more investable and price will reflect that, and that will be great for RAI.

<summary>u/Bigwiseguy55 helps us hold our conviction</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lhfuva/daily_general_discussion_june_22_2025/mz439h0/)

I don't believe I have commented since the r/ethfinance days, I have lurked, but let me share some personal conviction. ETH to 10k? EZPZ. Eth to 100K? a matter of time. Eth to 1 Mil? Maybe, but if we have the [Trillion Dollar Security Initiative](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/05/14/trillion-dollar-security), I am not concerned. War/Bombing is not great, and my heart goes out to those who are suffering as a result, however I don't think that takes true value away from what Ethereum provides by being the most secure and decentralized asset in the crypto space. I hope this brings some comfort amongst the "looming war falling knife" for lack of a better term. It is easy to feel queasy short term, but don't lose sight of what Ethereum is capable of that nothing else can provide.

<summary>u/haurog gives us a warning on why you need to be using an adblocker</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1li83bo/daily_general_discussion_june_23_2025/mzai5pu/)

If you do not have an adblocker in your browser, here is one more reason to install one. 

In the last few hours the cointelegraph website got 'hacked' and apparently if you went to the site a pop-up appeared which lead to a Cointelegraph ICO airdrop (obviously fake) which then wanted to drain your wallet.

As far as I understand, the website did not really get hacked, but an ad banner added malicious code to the website which allowed the pop-up to appear. It is well known that that ad banners can be a source to compromise your PC as the ad delivery networks do not (cannot?) really check what they are delivering. This is called Malvertising.

Obviously, users with wallets are a great target for these type of attacks. 

I personally use uBlock origin and privacy badger on my main browser. uBlock origin has worked flawlessly for many years for me now (\~10 years) and before that I used adblock plus for many years. My router also has a simple adblocking feature which protects devices/apps which do not support adblocking.

As always, downloading a browser extension is something which needs to be well thought through. In essence they are pieces of code which alter the behaviour of your browser. If they are malicious they can also be a source to get compromised. In the case of adblockers, the choice is very clear, at least to me.

You can also use a browser which already comes with a feature to block ads. Brave would be such a browser. Vivaldi and I think Opera also come with ad blocking included.

Gish gallop, make a number of factually wrong statements without evidence or proof. Unfortunately it's more time consuming to engage in disproving stuff with facts and data that is to post this bullshit every few days. This is how disinformation looks like nowadays, it exploits this asymmetry.

> Almost all usage metrics are down only.

False in all accounts.

L1 Gas used is at max levels historically and basically capped at the maximum set by the network @ 36M limit/16M target.

![](https://imgur.com/6pvHWS4)

L1 tps are also flirting with maximum levels, which is consistent with the above figure for gas.

![](https://imgur.com/Nh6eaWA)

Blobs were capped for a long time at 3, months after releasing them. Now that the target was raised to 6 we see them increase again.

![](https://imgur.com/nPHBp42)

L1 + L2 transactions are literally at historic record and raising

Monthly Revenues of L2s

> I'd say if ETH is gonna make a new ATH then the L2 tokens will be the canary in the coalmine and show a sign of life long before. Till then, there is no chance of any new ATH for ETH

Do not confuse L2s with their tokens. L2 tokens are nowadays just a governance token, their tokenomics suck. It's just a voting right, it's unclear to me why the should be worth anything at all. That may change in the future but not today.
L2s on the other hand are thriving and growing as the charts above show.

> Many L2s are shutting down

<https://l2beat.com/>

I mean there is over 100 L2s at the moment and the number keeps growing. For sure the space will have to end up consolidating, that's what happens in a free market. But for the moment this number has been up only.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll raises a concern about the US economy in the short to medium term</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lj2gie/daily_general_discussion_june_24_2025/mzgqcpw/)

So it seems pretty established that the US economy doing well is a pre-requisite for crypto and ETH doing well. So I have a question. I will try to avoid the obvious politics which we all know about and have our own opinions on, but there seems to be a lot of evidence of a growing issue arising from the ICE raids and "deportations" (side node, this is a very misleading term since people are often being sent to places which aren't where they're from [as was just approved by the supreme court](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-allows-trump-to-restart-swift-deportation-of-migrants-to-locations-that-are-not-their-home-countries).

Anyway... the fact of the matter is that a lot of tax paying hard workers (some legally working there, many not) in the USA are suddenly disappearing and there are many reports of businesses, particularly in [agriculture](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-mass-deportation-farms-breaking-point-2064190) and [construction industries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2025/06/16/trumps-immigration-raids-worsen-constructions-108-billion-labor-shortage/) being unable to find workers with huge shortfalls in labour. In agriculture alone, this has projected to cost the US literal hundreds of billions of dollars since as many as [40% of agricultural workers are undocumented immigrants.](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-mass-deportation-farms-breaking-point-2064190) Even if ICE doesn't remove every immigrant, many of them won't want to show up at work or places they spend their money for the fear of being kidnapped by federal agents or organised people posing as such.

Not only will this directly decrease GDP, but a large amount of US produced agricultural products and of course construction work is locally consumed. So a reduction in supply will increase costs and with a shortfall in production, the US will have to import more (don't forget the tariffs which are still in limbo).

So what are our takes on this with regards to the economy and how it impacts ETH price?

Strictly speaking economically, I find this very concerning. It will reduce GDP and it will be highly inflationary. So long as Jerome Powell is the fed chair, that inflation is not going to be left to run hot with lower interest rates. Typically, these structural inflationary things like this take 3-12 months to start to show up in the economy and this has been going on for a month or two now...

I don't know about you guys, but it's making me want to take some profits before the end of the year, regardless of what price is doing. I worry that a big storm is brewing and I think having some more stable assets on hand would be wise for weathering the storm.

Reminder to please keep this on topic to the economic impacts and relating back to ETH and crypto.

<summary>u/haurog introduces Airbender, ZKSync's huge leap forward in ZK provers</summary>
[View on Reddit â†’](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lj2gie/daily_general_discussion_june_24_2025/mzkoidn/)

ZKsync just released airbender, an open source, general purpose ZK prover.  It runs on a single, very high end, professional GPU (an H100). Airbender is about a factor of 5 faster than the closest contender. It takes them 35s to prove an Ethereum block. We can compare this to the SP1 release by succinct lab a month ago. They were able to prove Ethereum blocks in under 12 seconds, but needed 160 high end consumer GPUs (RTX 4090). 

One of the criticisms of having to have provers in a future iteration of the Ethereum network was that they are a centralization vector. To be able to generate a full proof on a single GPU makes proving of Ethereum blocks so much more affordable for many more actors. Sure, an H100 is very expensive (\~30k $) but the SP1 setup cost around 300k-400k$. That is more than order of magnitude cheaper. ZKsync airbender has not yet reached the goal of real time proving, but it is a pretty massive step in the right direction. I have no idea how far people in the zk research space will be able to push the limits, but the speed in the last year has been crazy.

This will not only help a snarkified mainnet in the future, but all zksync based rollups (elastic network) will be 10 times cheaper to prove. They say it still is in beta, so no idea when it will be used in production.

Here in the EU, you might find resistance even selling crypto and using the proceeds to apply for a mortgage because they are "tainted". I have read many having those issues in my country, even if all they did was hold on Coinbase. People recommend going through Revolut or similar.
