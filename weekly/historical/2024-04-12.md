Give me one good reason why I shouldn't 80x leverage my entire stack then 80x that 80x then deposit all of that into a 980 day lockup of yxBgkLklyupyupYupfgCc-xETH to get frank points that can be exchanged for 200 yarn credits (at a rate of 649 Galaxy cones to 400 ant points I should have an apy of 49080%)?

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard does a deep dive on freedom</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bveuv9/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2024/ky32izo/)

Let's take a moment to talk about *freedom*. Here in the US there's this point of national pride they try to imprint on you that the US was founded on principals of freedom and somehow spreads the torch of freedom around the world. There's the bill of rights they trot out, right to free speech etc. A pedantic point I sometime raise with people is that if something is discretionally permitted by the government, it is not a true freedom. Right to free speech? Not if you yell fire in a crowded room, start a riot, libel, slander, etc. If a judge *can* issue a gag order, speech itself is not a freedom; it is *permitted*. Driving is not a right; it is permitted. Owning a firearm is not a right, it is permitted, despite what all the 2A folks want to believe.

In terms of true freedoms, you have very few true ones and even amongst your permitted rights they are often being deprecated by technology. For example you had the right to privacy, the government couldn't open your USPS mail without a warrant. This is still technically true, but the vast majority of mail has instead become email and the US doesn't need a warrant to scry that. You had the freedom to transact with cash, but increasingly every payment is digital and those rights don't carry over. We hear frequently stories of people that go to deposit to a bank and have the deposit frozen. You have to report transactions over $10k, which practically means less and less expensive things in purchasing power each year due to inflation. Legislative inaction and judicial activism, in the face of technological progress, are eroding what few permitted freedoms we still have.

The notion that everything every citizen does should be permitted is attractive to those who wield power. They want you to have to ask their permission so they can say no and only permit actions that preserve or expand their position of power and at a time and place most convenient for them. The days tick by and the vice constraining what you are allowed to do silently tightens each day. The people who need freedoms the most are those with the most controversial ideas, the ones most likely to destabilize the status quo; for good or ill.

People like Warren fundamentally disagree with me on the freedom to transact. They want the freedom to transact to fully transition to a permitted freedom. They make arguments like "equal playing field" with the banks that are already wound in the straight jacket for them. They argue that the only people who need these freedoms are those with malicious intent. They reductively argue that blockchains are financing North Korea and child porn. Of course, they are only here to protect us. It's very much analogous to the "nothing to hide" arguments you get from the surveillance state encroaching on your right to privacy and it's every bit as ethically wrong. They couldn't be further from the founding principals of this nation if they tried.

Your transactions are an expression of your values. You invest in things you believe in, you buy things that add value to your life, you donate to causes you hold dear. Limiting your transactions is fundamentally an attack on your ability to express your values and shape the world to align with them. The moral compass of crypto is a controversial one, precisely because it bucks the trend and creates true freedom; for good or ill. So yes, there are scammers abound, memecoins with deliberately hateful content, and rugs every day but there are also people escaping the oppressive inflation of their nation state, financing art and innovation, and eroding the role parasitic middlemen plaguing our society.

So, asking for permission simply won’t do. I'd rather just be free.

<summary>u/Stobie explains token approvals</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bveuv9/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2024/kxzp0pn/)

approve() is part of the most common standard token interface, erc20. It has nothing to do with ethereum and is unrelated ethereum upgrades. Tokens can be any contract which implement any interface, or if you want they can all be from the same factory and you can check if they're in that factories mapping of built tokens if you want to be sure what they are.

There have always been tokens which do it differently but erc20 isn't going anywhere, you'll stop noticing it when account abstraction becomes standard. For example on starknet ethereum rollup where account abstraction is default the approve and function call all take place within a single tx. Same can be true with dapps which use dsproxy.

ERC 4337 is going to win and become account abstraction standard. I hate it but it'll be fine. Would rather hard fork and do it properly.

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi has an $ARB delegate update and a $HOP delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bw9oqm/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2024/ky698gc/)

ARB DAO updates:

* I voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247/35) funding a team to work on a more user-friendly tool to bypass the sequencer when it is down. While admittedly the tech side is probably beyond my scope of knowledge, the broad concept I think is important enough to explore for decentralization purposes. 
* I tentatively voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368/145) the initial temp check of a $200M gaming fund to target gaming on Arbitrum. It seemed to have a lot of community support, although I indicated some changes I'd like to see if it went to a Tally vote. I'm torn... as I want to fund all types of projects to help Arbitrum grow, however I'm not super sold on blockchain gaming personally and I'd like to see more detail for a proposal of this size. We will see what the changes look like, but I'm probably leaning 'against' if unchanged and went to Tally today. 
* I voted ["For"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387/34) Tally support to improve their governance page. All on-chain voting goes through Tally, so I look forward to their ideas and research into improving that process for both delegates but also people looking to delegate. The ideas presented should make it far easier to view delegate information, as well as increase transparency for those who vote. And I look forward to this one a lot!
* I voted ["Against"](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/51) a proposal to continue temporary funding of any project that passed and showed success in the initial STIP phase. This would occur alongside the 3 month LTIP window. This was contentious, with a 61% approval, 31% against vote. My main concern, echo'd by others, was that there was no real data to conclude what qualified as a successful grant round or not. As such, this moves the grantspace backwards as it doesn't incorporate things we learned from the STIP / LTIP rounds. Additionally, I felt that the funds would be better used for a comprehensive and all-inclusive grant round after the 12 week LTIP has been completed. As at some point continually doing temporary, short grant rounds isn't a sustainable option. 

I'll also update everyone here that the March delegate incentive program data is out - [here](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-march-2024/23043). This is a trail program looking at ways to incentive delegates to participate more meaningfully in governance, rewarding active voting and discussion. I actually ended up being rank #1 out of all those who participated! Hopefully those who delegate to me here feel adequately represented :) and know that I try my best to make sure your voting power isn't wasted.

Quick HOP governance update. 

I've spent the last few months working on applying to the ARB Long-Term grant program on behalf of Hop, heading up a team with a few other HOP delegates. Council voting results have been [released](https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/ltipp-council-screening-period-results/23029) (list of all passing projects here) and HOP has passed the first round! So now it goes to the ARB delegates for vote this week for final approval. 

The grant is asking for 500k ARB tokens with the goal of making bridging to the ARB networks cheaper for users. This will be done through fee rebates and liquidity incentives (to reduce slippage), and if it goes live should hopefully help users switch between L2 networks to take advantage of the growing space. 

I'll also add, I worked as well to apply for a similar grant through [Optimism](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/hop-protocol-05609313574623109). Hopefully with similar results.

<summary>u/interweaver looks into the different mentalities of people buying crypto</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bx39o4/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2024/kyenvwr/)

Like most of the rest of you, I sometimes ponder why Ethereum in recent years tends to perform so... differently... from many other cryptoassets out there.

I keep coming back to this one reason:

**Most people today buy crypto to gamble, not to invest.**

The market, broadly speaking, is not interested in fundamentals. It sees crypto as a giant casino, where if you're ~~lucky~~ better and faster at reading the trends and moods and narratives, you can become rich overnight, and escape the increasingly dystopian financial state of society. Fundamentals are not the bedrock of deciding what is and isn't a good deal, in this mentality - they are a ball and chain that keeps an asset tethered to reality, when what you actually want is one that is free to ascend into outer space with no pesky P/E ratios or highly technical upgrades to slow understanding and buzz. The more innocent an asset is of any practical use, the less beholden it therefore is to actually needing to support that use, to actually addressing that market, to actually *working*. If you're not *supposed* to do anything, you can't fail, and the market can't fail to understand what you do!

By contrast, most of us here would consider ourselves investors. We *do* care about utility, and we *do* care about real yields, and we *do* watch each upgrade with bated breath, and we *do* follow the discourse on roadmaps and adoption. We care about those pesky fundamentals, because we understand that having a fundamentals-driven thesis is the difference between investing and gambling, and we **are not here to gamble.** Ethereum, which by this point is deeply embedded in the crypto and web3 ecosystems, and which has, by most metrics, already won the adoption war - that's something we can sink our teeth into, and the fundamentals look *pristine*. Ethereum is bae for us because in buying it, we can feel secure that we are *investing* in something that has real underlying value beyond memes and narratives and the attention economy.

Consider the chasm between those two mentalities, and consider that we are in the *incredibly distinct* minority right now. We're rocking up to a casino with spreadsheets and reams of research. And we're shocked when the degenerates around us take one look at our stodgy "internet of value", our "global settlement layer", our "world computer", and pass it by, because *it has won a battle that memecoins are not even trying to fight.* 

Times are changing, of course. The gamblers that still make up the large majority of the market are soon going to be dwarfed by the massive capital that institutional investment can bring to bear, and make no mistake, those investors of size *do* do their homework, they *do* care about fundamentals. They know, like we do, that selling shovels during this gold rush is the best way to profit, and that Ethereum is that shovel, and moreover, that it will grow into the digital equivalent of Manhattan real estate in the fullness of time. How soon these more competent investors will arrive en masse is hard to say, of course - we've been crying out, "the institutions are coming, the institutions are coming" like some kind of latter-day Bilbo Baggins for years now. But I think most would agree that the ETF approvals, whenever they may come, will in many ways herald that advent. The time of fundamentals is not here yet, but it is coming.

So while we all sit here gnashing our teeth and pulling our hair while the markets happily ignore our precious Ethereum, keep in mind that while we're a tiny component of those markets today, what we really are is *forerunners*. 

We're not the last of our kind in a world devoid of reason, raging against the dying of the light.

We're the first.

<summary>u/reuptaken thinks something is missing in DeFi</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bx39o4/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2024/kyc6az2/)

I have this idea for quite some time now and I'd like to share it with you.

I think that DeFi lacks it's own high level script language. All major systems have SDKs (for advanced developers) and – on the other hand – UI, but nothing in between.

Take Uniswap as an example: you have low level SDK, where you have to deal directly with all the components (and bignumbers, various notations and so on) or pretty clumsy UI (try to move your position to a different range, even if it doesn't require swapping tokens – it takes lot of clicking, waiting and it's almost guaranteed that price will move while you're doing all of this.

The solution would be high level language or set of scripts which would allow to execute all the most important functions of given Defi system by using simple commands. It should eg. understand token symbols, decimal numbers.

So instead of 100+ lines of code or using browser etc you could do:

\`movePosition 29133 2000 3000\` and after confirmation (which could be disabled) it's done for you.

or, in interactive mode, you could do

\`movePosition\` and you'd be asked to select from list or type which position, then set range.

Those commands could be executed as scripts. There could be also an event watcher (eg. watching price on some pool) to which you could bind scripts, executed when some conditions are met. Eg. when APY on AAVE is lower than on sDAI, withdraw USDC, convert to DAI using Curve and stake on Spark. Even if not automated it's much easier, faster to execute and probably cheaper.

What do you think about it?

**EDIT:** If there are some devs who'd like to do such project, please pm me.

<summary>u/alexiskef tells us about one of the original cypherpunks</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bxw498/daily_general_discussion_april_7_2024/kyg795p/)

Yesterday, u/syzygy00778 posted a [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/s/9aD5v63vIo) to a comment discussing the identity of Satoshi. Buried in the comments is another link, to an [EXCELLENT article](https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10) titled "Len Sassaman and Satoshi: a Cypherpunk History".

I'll paste the first two paragraphs, and let you read the rest..

"We’ve lost too many hackers to suicide. What if Satoshi was one of them?

Embedded on every single node of the Bitcoin network is an obituary. Hacked into the transaction data, it’s a memorial to Len Sassaman, a man essentially immortalized in the blockchain itself. A fitting tribute in more ways than one.

Len was a true Cypherpunk— equal parts brilliant, irreverent, and idealistic. He devoted his life to defending personal freedoms through cryptography, working as a developer on PGP encryption and open-source privacy technology, as well as an academic cryptographer researching P2P networks under blockchain inventor David Chaum."

<summary>u/nixorokish is looking for feedback from all solo/home stakers!</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bypiin/daily_general_discussion_april_8_2024/kynxvls/)

Any node operators / solo stakers!

EthStaker & Obol are putting out a survey to get to know the landscape of home stakers and solo stakers. The goal is to create publicly available data that accurately represents what home/solo stakers care about, what kind of software and services we mostly use, what we need, etc. The info can be used to advocate for stakers in ongoing research based on their own words. Some questions were contributed by EF researchers themselves

It shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes, most questions are optional, and no data collected can be tied back personally to people (the survey software is FOSS!). We aim to repeat the survey every 6-12 months to get an idea of how the landscape is changing. It's available in English, Mandarin, Spanish & Italian. We'll leave it open for 2-3 weeks depending on volume

**The survey is primarily aimed at those running personal validators** (anywhere! Cloud services, bare metal services, at home, with a staking-as-a-service provider), **minipools, or DVT clusters**. If folks have any feedback or suggestions for the next iteration of the survey, would love to hear them! Feel free to direct them to me or to the EthStaker team email (team at ethstaker dot cc)

<summary>u/KuDeTa brings us an Aestus update and u/superphiz endorses it</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bzjwc2/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2024/kyumb50/)

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

The Aestus Relay team (that's me, and /u/austonst) have decided to run an experiment in the EigenLayer AVS Operator space. I want to test whether our service and reputation in the MEV-Boost ecosystem as a credibly neutral and solo-staker focussed infrastructure provider, might be of benefit in other domains. I honestly don't know how this is going to work out, but it's an interesting sideline to pursue.

So, as EigenDA hits mainnet today, i'm announcing our intent, and hoping that you might support this by delegating your Native or Liquid Restaking Tokens to us [here](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x30eafe8869a1528660a97b7a7e8e2d0037dcb922). Once we hit the required threshold of 320 ETH, we'll begin operations. I expect this to take a few days. 

I'll write out a longer post that sets out our motivations and intent, soon. But in brief: it seems clear that the restaking and AVS ecosystem is in danger of rapid domination by staking pools. We hope to make a small difference by leveraging our existing infrastructure in pursuit of decentralisation. 

The technology doesn't appear to support it yet, but once it's possible - we'll figure out how to make sure native solo re-stakers don't pay any fees to use our AVS services.

 I don't encourage anyone to participate in Eigenlayer restaking because of their stated intention to onboard all validators (that's a form of network capture), but if you DO use Eigenlayer and need to delegate your LSD tokens to a node operator, I'd really encourage you to choose Aestus.

Aestus is made up of two long time members of /r/ethfinance, /u/austonst and /u/KuDeTa. In all of my interactions with them I've found them to be working in the right directions.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard explains how big of a deal fully homomorphic encryption is</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1bzjwc2/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2024/kyu8nn2/)

So on the EVM call last Friday [I went on a rant](https://www.youtube.com/live/xYQWGTENc5o?t=4624) for a few minutes after JT read my doot. It's so good I'm literally just cleaning it up and transcribing it here:

FHE is complementary to zk-proofs. Zk-proofs say that I did the calculation honestly. We can prove something like I calculated 4+5 honestly and you don't have to go and rerun it yourself to get the answer to that. FHE can be used for many things outside of AI but it's especially valuable for things like DePin.

For example Biometric Authorization. When you want to take your thumbprint or eyeprint and use that as an authorization mechanism. You don't want to give someone your decrypted eyeprint. Today, without FHE, we encrypt your data in transit so the people in the middle can't get it, then we decrypt it on the receiving side, and then the person on the receiving side now has your decrypted eyeprint and can basically just impersonate you. There is fundamentally trust with whomever is the processor of your data.

With FHE, we can give you an encrypted eyeprint, they can check that your eyeprint is actually you, without knowing it's you. They don't have something that can be reused. So they can do authorization without you leaking your public data.

The same thing would be true if I was in healthcare and wanted to make health predictions about you. If I know it's you and you give me all your health data what am I going to do? As a centralized provider I'm going to take that data, I'm going to jot it down, and then I'm going to sell it on the data market to some health insurance companies so they can jack up your rates.

As a user, I want the output of the LLM that tells me what might be wrong with me without the processor of the data being able to jot it down and sell it maliciously against me and add that extra monetization. The same thing would be true in a lot of places. It should be true throughout all of web2. This should explode and become mandatory in certain environments where privacy should be sacrosanct. But in DePin especially, because of permissionless compute, I can't even just say I trust Amazon. I have no idea who the processor of the data is and due to market forces it is going to devolve into the most malicious operator who is able to extract the most monetization out of the data they steal.

So for DePin to be applicable to any area where there is the remotest sense of secrecy or privacy we need to be able to do calculation on an untrusted operator and both prove that they did the calculation honestly (zk-proof) and that they didn't have access to the underlying data (FHE). So you put these two technologies together and you get something that can eat into the margins of centralized compute providers like AWS in a significant way.

To put their margins in perspective, a P5 instance on AWS right now is $92 an hour. I can buy that machine for about $350k. At $92 an hour that's over $800k a year, Amazon is making over 200% APR on the investment of the machine. There is an extraordinarily huge margin there and the effect of that is that the highest grade of compute we have isn't democratized and therefore the apps that require that grade of compute are increasingly being centralized into a few tech oligarchs.

Due to the compute requirements, this basically translates to AI. So we're seeing brick wall around AI being built every time we add another parameter to the LLM. Chat GPT was 1.5B parameters; it takes about 13 gigs of video ram to hold and use the model. Chat GPT 4 is bigger. We're going to go to a trillion parameters. We're going to get to a point where you need to have hundreds of gigs of video ram just to serve on the model and that's not going to be accessible to the average person. The average person isn't going to buy a half million dollar machine from NVidia. We need to be able to provide that high end compute to them at a lower margin than AWS is charging.

That is both an opportunity and a moral imperative of Defi and Depin. We need to make the compute required to access the technologies we are pioneering more democratically accessible before they become permanently locked behind brick wall and only accessible to a few tech oligarchs and used in their most extractive possible way against humanity.

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra discusses the pros and cons of an ETH issuance change</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c0dgy2/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2024/kyzga3i/)

Today's Bankless discussion came at the perfect time. I had just finished reading u/AElowsson 's [analysis](https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171) and I think I understand more clearly what's really at stake (heh) here. I have to admit my initial reaction when I read the proposal was pretty negative, so in order to help others make up their mind and also keep track of all the arguments that I see, I've made a list of the pros and cons as I've understood them, and explained them as simply as possible. If there are any more that you can think of and ELI5, I'll be happy to add them to the list.

**Pros of issuance change:**

- The network stability benefits from an optimal number of validators, as it's more difficult for a huge number of validators to effectively attest blocks fast enough.

- The ETH that remains in circulation is not superseded by LSTs, which apart from having smart contract, centralization and rugpull risks, make the LST a proxy for ETH. As a result, ETH does not lose its "moneyness" in the eyes of its users.

- Non-stakers benefit immensely from an issuance reduction. Currently, non-stakers benefit from the burn by having an effective \~0.5% APY, and at the same time, stakers get >3%. However, as more ETH is staked, non-stakers end up not benefiting at all as more and more rewards go to stakers, who at a minimum will be getting 2% at 100% ETH staked.

- The more ETH is staked, the harder it will be to implement this change. This is due to several reasons, most important of which is that big staking providers have a huge incentive to block it. Lido has already come out in favour of *ALL ETH* being staked and wanting as much of it to be stETH. What would happen in a post-staked ETH ETF world, when BlackRock lobbies against implementing a change to issuance?

**Unclear if issuance change will be a pro or a con:**

- It is not clear how this change will affect the dynamics between solo/hobby stakers and huge staking services. On one hand, there's definitely a limit where solo stakers would exit, and if the staking pools manage to profit though other means, the APY could be very negative and drive all solo stakers out. On the other hand, a market optimized APY leaves less space for staking pools to get a cut of the profits, and if solo stakers eventually have all the ways to profit through other means as big pools, they might be more resistant to low APY.  Personally, I would keep a validator up even at half a percent APY, but would not keep my validator up at, say, -5% APY.

-  Fewer ETH staked means less economic security for a network that aims to secure trillions of dollars of assets. However, those fewer ETH can end up having more economic value in the long term due to a more robust and valuable network, so the end result is not immediately clear.

**Cons of issuance change:**

- Changing the issuance *again* will lead to huge amounts of FUD, and ETH losing some of its "moneyness" due to the belief that the EF can unilaterally change the monetary supply.

- It's definitely not good optics at a time when the SEC is investigating and will be pretty bad for our hopes for an ETF.

- The issuance can and probably will need to be changed again. The main reason is that there are economics we simply do not understand, like the effect restaking will have on the amount of ETH staked. Also, the amount of validators might go down *significantly* with EIP-7251 (max-ETH per validator), leading the network to require more validators to be sufficiently decentralized. Finally, there are ideas for future updates that, if implemented, will significanly alter the economics of ETH. MEV-burn is one frequently discussed here, but the [Anti-correlation Penalties for validator attestations](https://ethresear.ch/t/analysis-on-correlated-attestation-penalties/19244), which in my understanding disincentivizes big staking providers by implementing heavier penalties when lots of validators lose an attestation at the same time, will most probably also affect the number of validators and the staking pool-solo staker dynamics.

---Personal opinion below---

So here is my view now: I am still mostly on the fence regarding the *immediate* (see:Pectra) issuance curve change, but at the same time **I want to come out in support of an eventual change of the issuance curve**  towards one where staking much more than 50% of the supply is heavily disincentivized by negative issuance.

The main reason for this is that most of the disadvantages of changing the issuance are short-term troubles, and won't have any effect on the long-term longevity of Ethereum. I'd rather see the project succeed and change the world, than make a bit more money for a year or five. "I'm in it for the tech" might be a meme, but it's also the best way to analyze long-term investments, and it would be much easier for me to leave a project that has ossified before being finished, than it would be to leave because the price dumped. Changing Ethereum's issuance will not only make it a more robust network, but also better money, especially for smaller holders that cannot stake. 

ETH needs to keep changing for the better, so don't sacrifice the future to the present. That's what Bitcoin did, and apart from the fact that it will have huge issues eventually, it ended up being only a shadow of what it could be.
