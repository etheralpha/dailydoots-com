As the best looking member of this sub, I'm thinking about starting an OF where I sexily talk about Ethereum.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard helps to educate us about scams</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1neugb4/daily_general_discussion_september_12_2025/ndurv6k/)

So I just had a partner of mine get scammed trying to send me money. Really sad to see. They just copied the address of the last payment to me from the gnosis safe transaction history and sent it. Unfortunately that last payment was using a spoofed USDC contract and wasn't initiated by them but by another caller and the transaction history on gnosis safe is really really dumb. Some basic wisdom that I told them.

1. Take the address from my invoice obviously. They were just trying to save literally one second of switching between windows because they already were copy pasting the amount due from the invoice.
2. Use ENS when available. A typo there will most likely just fail to resolve; it's unlikely to cause harm.
3. Use a standalone Gnosis safe app, not the web app. This wouldn't have solved this particular problem but if you're using a frontend you have no control over the dependencies.
4. This is a problem with ERC-20 sends in general. As I write on [my explorers guide](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#send-a-test-transaction-first) "There are attackers who generate wallets with similar addresses to ones you own. They’ll even “dust attack” you with some tiny amount of funds to your address so their address will appear in a short list when you fill out the send form. You can simply miskey something and replace a character somewhere. An OS virus can replace the target address in your clipboard. A malicious wallet software can replace the target address in the transaction before forwarding it to your hardware wallet. There’s just a lot of things that can go wrong with this model."

This entire attack vector would be better avoided if we had a decent invoicing system on chain. In addition to sending them the legal invoice form I could have sent them an invoice on chain so I would **pull** the funds from them. If someone somehow hijacks the address on my pull then an invoice goes to a scammer address and no harm is done.

Does anyone here have any experience using a decent on-chain invoicing system? I know request network was supposed to do that back in the day but they don't seem to support sign in with ethereum or even wallet logins on their site and I'm not buying some shitty REQ token to interact with a basic invoicing system.

<summary>u/TheRatj asks about blind signing</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1neugb4/daily_general_discussion_september_12_2025/ndvrwwu/)

I was swapping some rETH to ETH using CowSwap. On a Ledger Nano S, using Metamask.

This requires Blind Signing. To my untrained eye, there was nothing I could validate on the ledger screen to confirm it was the correct transaction. This is definitely a bit of a problem. I just went with it and luckily the trade worked as intended. 

Is there something I should be looking for to check to ensure it's the right transaction?

Is there a different wallet (eg. Rabby) that would fix this issue?

Is there a different hardware wallet that would fix this issue?

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth raises a valid concern about the centralization rick of all major treasury companies being located in one jurisdiction</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nfotal/daily_general_discussion_september_13_2025/ndyq3nl/)

Thought exercise: 

*What are the risks to Ethereum when it comes to DATs all being US based and with a combined target of roughly 20% of all ETH currently in existence?*

I find myself thinking that having a variety of DATs is meaningless if they are all US based. 

*What's the likelihood of a seizure of assets or a flat out prohibition in the future?*

Ethereum is pushing for scale but also for *privacy features*. I fear the latest policy shift is just mirage and that the end game is too damaging for the power accumulation of any government, so it's likely going to be slammed into the ground. Not even by political opposition... It's even more likely to happen at the hands of the same administration currently encouraging it.

How likely is it that Ethereum *actually* gets embedded into the current traditional financial system so that de-attaching it becomes more problematic than the alternative of letting it run?

<summary>u/tomsmac reports on incredibly bullish onchain signals and u/LogrisTheBard elaborates on these bullish signals</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nhczkt/daily_general_discussion_september_15_2025/neeupl9/)

[u/tomsmac](https://reddit.com/u/tomsmac):

Just remarkable bullish signals.

Between 55K and 400K daily ETH leaving the exchanges and into self custody on a DAILY basis followed by Whale’s wallets selling BTC and then buying ETH is perhaps the most bullish signals that I’ve ever seen since the $1.5-1.7 bottom and I’ve been doing this for a very long time.

Financial institutions, both American and foreign are stacking at incredible speed.

You’re not going to want to miss this.

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

[Accumulation signals](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n4m3vn/daily_general_discussion_august_31_2025/nbr23q8/) have been flashing everywhere for months. Retail wallet share has been falling; whale wallet share has been accumulating at a massive rate. Exchange reserves are plummeting and DATs have been grabbing all they can before their mNAV runs out of fuel.

I do expect we'll see some debt offerings soon where they can feed the corporate bond payments using ETH yields. If it works for MSTR where BTC has 0 yield I see little reason it shouldn't work for ETH with an inherent 2.5%+ yield. If the DXY wants to take another leg down and Powell lowers rates that will make this even more favorable for whichever DAT wants to try it.

<summary>u/Fiberpunk2077 keeps us in the loop on agentic payment standards and u/rhythm_of_eth thinks that Google's Agents Payments Protocol is a big deal</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ni8i0e/daily_general_discussion_september_16_2025/nej0pg5/)

[u/Fiberpunk2077](https://reddit.com/u/Fiberpunk2077):

A month ago the Ethereum Foundation X account posted a thread on agentic payments using crypto via the x402 Payment Required standard, developed as an open standard by Coinbase.

Today Google released the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) open standard for broader agentic payments, but it includes x402 as an extension for crypto payments.

Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation were collaborators for the new standard.

[u/rhythm_of_eth](https://reddit.com/u/rhythm_of_eth):

I low-key think that Google spearheading the AP2 (Agents Payment Protocol) with contributions of the EF and Coinbase is a big deal.

There's a decent chance that Google might convince financial institutions to leverage their GCUL L1 chain instead of Ethereum with the promise of better liquidity and performance down the line.

I'm wondering how many will fall for the counter-party risk trap and the compatibility issues with other Blockchains (GCUL is not EVM). 

Google is making it difficult to anticipate these problems by pushing public standards like AP2 promising Blockchain interoperability with businesses at the app layer.

The EF is a contributor to said standards and I'm left wondering what will happen in this particular front.

It does feel like Ethereum has challenges arising in many fronts with...

- Corporate L1s competing for TradFi attention
- Fractious L2s competing for retail user attention

It's very funny seeing Solana peeps flip flop constantly on narratives.

First fees are too high, then Solana is better because it generated more fees.

Now I've seen someone post Solana has more staked market cap with eth, then toly post

Like bro your entire community spent years saying economic security is a meme and eth has wasted capital. Enjoy a 63% stake rate at 8% inflation lmao

Apparently nothing. It's risk free staking.

<summary>u/haurog gives us a full run down on the upcoming Fusaka hard fork</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1njzewo/daily_general_discussion_september_18_2025/newfx4o/)

In todays ACD (all core devs) call the Fusaka upgrade timeline was discussed and some definitve dates have been laid down:

On Monday there will be code freeze for clients. Next Thursday (25th) client versions will be released with testnet upgrade times in the code.

The testnet upgrade times are the following:

- Holesky: October 1st 
- Sepolia: October 14th
- Hoodi: October 28th

Any of the upgrades will be on pause if an issue is encountered in one of the previous testnet upgrades.

The upgrade itself will not increase the number of blobs. These are now special upgrades BPO forks (blob parameter only forks) which automatically come 1 week (BPO1) and 2 weeks (BPO2) after each network has upgraded to Fusaka. Currently there is a target of 6 blobs and a maximum of 9 blobs per block. BPO1 will increase to 10/15 (target/max) and BPO2 to 14/21 (target max). Further increases are not yet scheduled and will be done once the network and clients have settled down and optimized for the now different workload and bandwidth. Theoretically Fusaka should allow for a target of 48 blobs per block. Plenty of room for rollups to grow. 

The mainnet upgrade has not been explicitly discussed, but according to their own agreed on upgrade timing mainnet should come end of November / beginning of December.

In short: We most probably get the Fusaka upgrade this year and this will bring a 2.3 times increase in blob space within a few weeks after the upgrade as well as a minimum price paid for these blobs.

UPDATE: There is now a more detailed document with the proposed upgrade epochs and times. The document also has a tentative mainnet upgrade date, but this has not been agreed upon yet and should only be taken as a suggestion for discussion after the last testnet upgrades: <https://notes.ethereum.org/@bbusa/fusaka-bpo-timeline>
