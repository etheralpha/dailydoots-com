<summary>u/haurog recommends the ZK Podcast's miniseries on lean Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1r9nfzz/daily_general_discussion_february_20_2026/o6eoi8n/)

The zk podcast started a miniseries on Lean Ethereum. The 6 part miniseries consists of an introduction, post quantum signature aggregation, post quantum cryptography security, LeanVM, devnets and then formal verification. Two days ago they announced it and released the first episode, the introduction to lean ethereum. It features Justin Drake and gives a brief overview over lean ethereum and they dive quite deep into LeanVM. LeanVM is, as far as I understand, a very basic virtual machine which can do all the cryptographic calculations necessary to use it in all the different places where it will be needed in Ethereum, be it the consensus layer, execution layer or blob verification.

If you are looking to get more into how Ethereum changes in the coming years from a technical side. It is probably worth a listen. I do expect it to get pretty in depth, so I do not expect me getting all the details, but I am looking forward to it. 

Here is the link to the podcast:

> NEW: Per sources in the room, today’s stablecoin meeting was smaller than last week and included reps from @coinbase, @Ripple, @a16z, plus trade groups @BlockchainAssn and @crypto_council. No individual bank reps attended — bank voices were represented via trade associations @ABABankers, @bankpolicy and @ICBA. 
> 
> Public statements from attendees are once again being described as “productive” and “constructive.” But what does that actually mean? 
> 
> Sources say there was a notable difference today: the White House took the lead in driving the discussion, rather than letting crypto firms and bank trades steer the discussion, as in prior meetings.
> 
> White House Crypto Council Executive Director @patrickjwitt brought draft text that served as the central focus of the conversation. The language acknowledged concerns banks raised in last week’s “Yield and Interest Prohibitions Principles” document, while making clear that any future restrictions on rewards would be narrow in scope. Earning yield on idle balances, a key crypto industry goal, is effectively off the table. The debate has narrowed to whether firms can offer rewards linked to certain activities.
> 
> One crypto-side attendee told me bank concerns appear to stem more from competitive pressures than from deposit flight, which had been framed as the original worry. A bank-side source told me they’re still pushing to include a deposit outflow study in the draft — one that would examine the growth of payment stablecoins and their potential impact on bank deposits.
> 
> The same source said they were encouraged by proposed anti-evasion language that would give the SEC, Treasury, and the CFTC authority to enforce a ban on paying yield on idle balances, with civil monetary penalties of $500,000 per violation, per day.
> 
> So what’s next? Bank trade groups will brief their members on today’s discussions and gauge whether there’s room to compromise on allowing crypto firms to offer stablecoin rewards. One source said an end-of-month deadline doesn’t seem unrealistic, with talks set to continue in the coming days.
> <https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/2024644096569332040>

I think maybe we do get a deal but it looks unlikely yield will be included on idle deposits. I would take that any day of the week. As long as defi is not killed.

<summary>u/gorewndis and u/Heringsalat100 compares the real tokenisation to glorified database numbers</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1rajeg9/daily_general_discussion_february_21_2026/o6kjynb/)

[u/Heringsalat100](https://reddit.com/u/Heringsalat100):

You can see how real-world asset tokenization is going on [this website](https://app.rwa.xyz/). If you are clicking on "Distributed" Ethereum is on top with $14.7 billion followed by BNB Chain with just $2.3 billion and Solana with only $1.7 billion.

"Distributed" is what we would call an actual decentralized blockchain based tokenization attempt. However, there is the option "Represented" where the description includes

> \[...\] using the blockchain as a recordkeeping layer \[...\] without enabling onchain investor transfer or distribution.

In this category Canton wins with $341 billion.

But seriously ... What is the point of that? Without onchain transfers and distributions this whole concept doesn't make sense (?) Which smart contracts are I supposed to use if onchain transfers and distributions aren't allowed? This sounds like a bad joke ...

[u/gorewndis](https://reddit.com/u/gorewndis):

That rwa.xyz data is really telling. The gap between "Distributed" ($14.7B on Ethereum) and "Represented" ($341B on Canton) is basically the gap between actual DeFi and just using a blockchain as a glorified spreadsheet.

The Canton numbers are misleading because they count every asset that's been "logged" on a permissioned chain, even if you can't actually do anything with it onchain. No composability, no permissionless access, no smart contract interaction. At that point you've just reinvented a database with extra steps.

Ethereum's number is smaller but it's *real* — those are actual tokenized assets you can use in DeFi, lend against, trade permissionlessly. Quality vs quantity.

<summary>u/haurog covers the latest developments with the much debated execution layer upgrade for the Hegota hard fork</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1rd88ab/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2026/o741pcq/)

There are some interesting developments for the Hegota upgrade regarding encrypted mempools. Hegota comes after the Glamsterdam upgrade, which probably comes this summer. That means Hegota might come by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. At the moment the core devs are deciding for the headliners for Hegota. Last week it was decided that Focil is the headliner on the consensus side. Focil is a great way to strengthen the censorship resistance of the Ethereum mainnet and one of the upgrades I have been looking forward to since the tornado cash sanctions in 2022. 

On the execution layer side there were 4 proposals for headliners:

- EIP-7807 SSZ execution blocks: Unifies the exchange format between concensus and execution layer, which should improve block transmission speeds.
- EIP-8144 Frame transactions: Lays the groundwork for allowing different kind of signature schemes to be used by accounts. Useful when migrating towards post quantum secure signature schemes (in 10 years...), but can also be used for other wallet features.
- EIP-8105 Universal enshrined Encrypted Mempool
- LUCID encrypted mempool

The last two are the interesting ones to me. The basic premise is that until now, the public mempool has been public and everyone could see what was happening in it. This opened everything up for toxic MEV to extract value from it. That is one of the reason all the private mempools started appearing. If you transmit a transaction through your wallet this transaction nowadays mostly goes to a private entity. This entity then gives access to this transaction to a select few MEV searchers, which looks at your transaction and finds ways to extract value from it. Most of the time the searchers are not allowed to sandwich you, but they can still extract MEV from you, just the most toxic versions are prohibited. This is kind of a win-win for the user and the searcher. The problem is though that it entrenches certain actors in the Ethereum space and they can decide who has access to this order flow data. Private mempools also means that the Focil upgrade does not help these transaction. They can be censored in private mempools if the the entity handling them does not like them. You also might not want to transmit directly on the public mempool as you might get front run there. Not a good situation. The two encrypted mempool proposals improve the situation, as they allow transactions in the public mempool to be encrypted. No one knows what they are doing, if they do not get included fast enough, then the Focil mechanism can force include them. When they are included in a block the the transaction then gets decrypted. Each of the two encrypted mempool proposals handles the decryption a bit differently. When they are decrypted the transactions have to be included at the beginning of a block (I think) in a specific order and cannot be sandwiched anymore. Pretty neat. The EIP-8105 proposal has been live on gnosis chain for a long time now and seems to work. The LUCID proposal is a rather new one with some simplifications. The interesting development yesterday was that the proposers of EIP-8105 publicly stated that they withdraw their EIP-8105 proposal and now fully support the LUCID proposal. Pretty impressive move. 

For me it looks like the encrypted mempool proposals are the ones with the most public backing and now that everyone rallies behind just one proposal it might go through. This means the Hegota upgrade could become a strong statement for censorship resistance. The decision for which execution side headliner get selected is happening this Thursday in the all core devs call (ACDE #231)

I will add the sources in a comment to this one.

UPDATE: For those interested a bit more, tomorrows Ready for Merge podcast by Christine Kim host two encrypted mempool devs. Not sure when exactly she will stream it but I guess the stream will appear on her youtube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@Ready4Merge/streams>

<summary>u/whisperedstate hasn't used Ethereum mainnet in years and starts a good discussion about real use cases and u/Inevitablechained and u/evm_lion wish there were new interesting projects</summary>

[u/whisperedstate](https://reddit.com/u/whisperedstate):

Time for a confession. I haven't used Ethereum mainnet in years, and I'm someone that downloaded the Mist wallet in 2016 just to play around and deploy contracts.

If I haven't had any reasons to use Ethereum, then the average person certaintly does not.

Everyone is hyperfixated on price, but price isn't going anywhere without real, compelling, use cases. The only mainstream application right now is Polymarket, and that's not even on Ethereum smh. Without use cases, the price might as well be the highest it'll ever be right now.

[u/Inevitablechained](https://reddit.com/u/Inevitablechained):

We have to remind ourselves that people went to jail for writing smart contracts. Compelling use cases are for sure here.

What I really wish we could end is the dumb hype cycle speculation. NFTs, ICOs, Meme coins, you name it. However it will be really heard to wipe that off until we have more examples like Polymarket.

A few things I would like to see for example.   
  
- Register news on-chain, so you can confirm who published it and when. 
- A very user-friendly app in your phone connected to stablecoins. So that you can pay anywhere or send people money wallet to wallet internationally. 
- ZK proof health records or VISA details while travelling
- "Sign in with Ethereum", I don't need to create another password...please

[u/evm_lion](https://reddit.com/u/evm_lion):

If I stay on this trajectory, it’ll soon be a year for me! I also downloaded Mist and synced Geth locally when I discovered the tech. 

I think that for me, I’ve become a bit of a “old hater” type over time, sceptic/pessimistic by default around any new project that pops up in my feed that I haven’t heard about before. In contrast to optimistic and engaged in the beginning, eager to try out anything and learn more.

I know that for me it was observing the flood of grifts gaining “all” the attention, while the original spirit, values and vision that I loved drowned a bit in all the greed. I don’t know how much of this is just my subjective impression though. I’m sure there were plenty of grifts when I entered as well, but that I was blinded by the cool tech so I didn’t notice. And there’s probably a lot of cool and genuine tech being built in the ecosystem right now, I just don’t see it (because I’m not searching).

(I still really love the idea, vision and core values behind Ethereum that brought me here, in case people read this as a capitulation.)

<summary>u/gadflyghoulie starts a discussion about the impact of MEV Boost on centralisation and u/edmundedgar delivers a clear and concise answer</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1rd88ab/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2026/o73kwpq/)

[u/gadflyghoulie](https://reddit.com/u/gadflyghoulie):

Is mevboost still considered to be a significant centralizing force in Ethereum? 

I know it's very normalized now, but I've never seen anyone say it has a non-negative effect. Back when it was discussed more it was about block builders being very centralized.

[u/edmundedgar](https://reddit.com/u/edmundedgar):

No, it's the opposite. The mevboost setup minimizes the centralizing effect of the existence of MEV. Mevboost gives us an open market where anyone can search for MEV and any staker can get the benefit. If we didn't have this open market then sophisticated stakers with expertise in capturing MEV would significantly outperform solo stakers who didn't have that expertise, and solo stakers would gradually migrate to large, sophisticated centralized pools.

<summary>u/superphiz shares his thesis on ETH as an investment and reflects on what has held true over the years</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1rf2aoa/daily_general_discussion_february_26_2026/o7i08r4/)

For years I imagined that Eth would become a safe haven currency. (I have a similar belief for btc, but it's far less transactional.) 

That hasn't materialized (yet), so my second guess was that it would thrive as a tech investment, and if so, it would make sense that the emergence of ai would propel us - it makes sense that autonomous agents WILL adopt crypto for inter-bot transactions ([see EIP 8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)). But still, AI is emerging and we're still not booming.

So my third thesis holds: that crypto is STILL just a speculative vehicle. It tanks when risk is high and thrives when there's a surplus of money. 

So, it's fine. We're still a speculative vehicle. This brings me to two potential conclusions:

1. This really sucks. It has been 10+ years and the technology STILL hasn't connected deeply with a use case, and it's just a game of markets shuffling coins that don't yet have an established purpose.

2. This ISN'T terrible. We see the future. We see a time where the world truly is digital, where autonomous agents outnumber people 100:1 and they need a transactional currency that is a first class citizen in their domain, and Eth has been building toward becoming this ideal transactional currency for ten years. We are ready.

Throughout my time in crypto I've imagined a million ways that we might find product-market-fit, and I sincerely believe we're really close. I think we're a blink of an eye away from mass adoption, but not the way we expected - by autonomous agents, not by people. And we'll still win.
