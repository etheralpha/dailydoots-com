Woah, did someone just exploit a vulnerability in the ERC-20 standard itself???!!! I am seeing a cascade of the largest ERC-20s like USDT and LINK getting all funds sent to 0x36c9aFAkE324b…. On etherscan.

Meanwhile other ERC-20s like DAI and USDC have frozen transfers in response. I’m impressed with their reaction times to be honest.

What sort of impact could this have on other EVM based blockchains like BNB? It seems like it will be a scramble for ethical exploiters to take funds before actual hackers do.

Anyway, no doubt April is wasting no time in showing how chaotic things can get on the 1st!

<summary>u/0xdefiant introduces himself to the sub and shares his project idea!</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jefgnli/)

gm r/ethfinance, I had the chance to talk with u/jtnichol yesterday, pretty outstanding guy. He told me to intro myself here and share an idea I have.

My name is Anthony Garrett— I’m a college student at Gonzaga and I started [Bankless Advisor](https://www.banklessadvisor.com/) in the Bankless DAO, a platform to connect financial advisors and clients, but we're in need of a pivot-- the idea I have is an app.My vision for a BA app is to create a web3 directory for users to send trade proposals to each other. Each account is a web3 wallet for users to trade and comment on other trades. Our market fit would start with the Bankless community and college students ([SPAWN](https://www.spawn.global/)).However, my long-term vision for the BA app: We allow users to import their data from other social media networks to their web3 wallet and build smart contracts that pool users data to connect ad buyers to users.

***I believe that this project has the potential to do good for the world, and the way we value our data, but I need a passionate dev team to bring this thing to life. So here I am looking for any advice, any groups that you think align with this vision, or anyone who is looking to help. (or if this idea sounds psychotic, I'm open to anything).***

I'm just a young self taught front end dev (that get's a lot of help from chat-gpt), but I have experience building trade proposal tech for financial advisors at [Defi Steward](https://www.defisteward.com/). Also, I have written further about this decentralized data model in the BA substack (not an advertisement, but here is a [link](https://open.substack.com/pub/banklessadvisor/p/internet-society-and-the-philosophy)).

If you have read this far and have ANY comments or suggestions as a start this journey I am all ears.

\- Thanks, AG

<summary>u/Ender985 has the latest from the NFT world</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jedxqmn/)

Meanwhile, in the NFT-verse..

Found this interesting development: a real estate agency sold off 20% of a house being rented in Texas, [using NTFs as ownership shares](https://blockworks.co/news/real-estate-investors-buy-nft-home). 

The property was valued at $235k, NFTs represented $100 of ownership (minimum buy was 5 NFTs, would have been easier to just make $500 NFTs..). In total, $45,600 was raised by the sale to 38 investors, who will then get their fractional part of the rent.

Estimating $1500 rent per month (not in TX so I have no idea of what prices look like over there), that would mean each $100 NFT share accrues $0.65 per month, so a median of $7.8 to each of the 38 investors.

Given these small numbers, the company decided to run this experiment on Solana, citing gas fees in ETH as a deterrent, and [bridging difficulties in L2s like Polygon](https://twitter.com/HomebaseDAO/status/1608604222433492992). Let's hope for these investors that when rent is due, the Solana network is still up :)

People were discussing u/Set1Less's post from yesterday in r/CC about the Arbitrum DAO drama but we can't directly link to r/CC because the mods there ban you for it. Surprisingly nobody copied a transcript so it's probably gone a bit under the radar in this sub. So here I am, shamelessly transcribing u/Set1Less's post.

> So Arbitrum distributed tokens last week and as per their tokenomics, it seemed that the team and VC allocation is locked for a year.
> 
> Well, they just made a proposal to grant themselves another 750 Million ARB tokens, worth almost $1 Billion from the DAO. They claim its for an "Administrative Budget Wallet". In reality, it looks like a blatant cash grab. Its the first governance proposal and they aren't even trying to be subtle about siphoning funds out.
> 
> Administrative Budget Wallet proposal
> 
> Under the disguise of operational and administrative efficiency, they are seeking to transfer 750 million tokens from the DAO to their own pockets, from which they will make "special grants" and what nots.

> In crypto, these things almost entirely mean cashing out for real world riches. We have seen thousands of examples of teams cashing out treasury funds. In Arbitrum's case, since the team and VC token allocations are locked, they are creating this new channel of funding which they can splurge on while their actual allocations remain locked.

> Some groups have already raised alarm against this blatant cash grab.

> These 750M tokens were supposed to be part of the treasury but now seemingly lay under the centralized control of 3 individuals.

> I hate to say it, but these kind of shady activities actually make people like Gensler right - by using shady structures from Cayman Islands, under the disguise of "DAO", they are staging a standard insider dumping scam where the team dumps token without any transparency while pretending their original allocations are locked.
> 
> Update:
> Apparently it seems that even before this vote has passed, Arbitrum team has already moved 40m ARB tokens to a new wallet, and then started distributing them to child wallets, and it appears from the transactions that millions have been already sent to Binance .

Due to the drama, most delegates are now voting against the proposal. You can follow the vote results here: <https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3be7368a662d1cf12fa4da768d626edbc013be0dc7b994fef2e24d9a54e4033a>

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi shares their thoughts as an ARB delegate</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/129amhp/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2023/jeppfhd/)

I guess a smidge late considering the threads yesterday and today, but obviously I want to post on it since I'm an ARB delegate for a decent chunk of people here.

First, I want to speak to AIP-1 as it stands on it's own as I think it's important for those delegating to get a feel for what I stand for. So for a second, let's ignore the now known issue at hand and presume the Arbitrum Foundation had not moved tokens yet / or I had voted before this was know. Maybe a pointless excercise at this point, but I find it important.

I would have still voted "against" in this case, with request for the AIP to be broken into smaller pieces.

I agree strongly with the first set of a DAO's AIPs being about setting ground rules for the DAO moving forward, especially with one as large as this. Not having a formal process in place can lead to disaster (ominous!), so this is important. However, I'm against trying to lump in too much at once. The obvious one is the 750M ARB to the Foundation Admin Budget, however frankly things like squeezing in a very loosely defined "Special Grants" process aren't a great idea either. Those are things that need fleshed out in their own debates / AIPs. It feels like those are things the foundation would assume would be controversial, but hoped to squeeze through due to the need for the overall framework taking priority. This AIP should have been broken into about 3 or 4 separate things.

Now, with that said and as it stands now, I'm obviously still continuing with my 'Against' vote. The issue I had before has only been exacerbated by moving funds before the vote. In reading comments on this daily thread and it seems that the community is largely asking for an "Against" vote as well, so I have an obligation to honor that within my duties as a delegate. Although honestely it does feel moot at this point given recent events... Others have surely said it better, but the fundamental issue is we can't accept funds being moved without DAO approval or else what is the point of this process? It should be interesting to see what happens now that we have a scenario where funds have been moved without approval from the DAO. Something I doubt will be resolved cleanly, as even before this was found out I was seeing forum pushback on the amount. I question if it will ever pass even upon a presumed rework / revote.

A final note, those who are delegating to me I don't blame you if this has soured the process... this has been sort of a smack in the face to me as well.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/)

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

There was a fascinating MEV "exploit" this morning to the tune of about $20mil dollars as a result in flaw in how mev-boost relays communicate with validators. There is some discussion below in the daily, and here is a good summary: <https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1642848556590723075>


The relay fix to prevent this happening again is here ([https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330)). This does has some significant side effects, the biggest of which is that \~10 sets of relay beacon nodes are now responsible for propagating all new blocks. Our ([u/austonst(https://reddit.com/u/austonst)) relay (<https://aestus.live>) was taken offline for builders as soon as we became aware of the threat and will update before we come online again. Never a dull day in ethereum.

[u/\_etherium](https://reddit.com/u/\_etherium):

It's been patched, just waiting for a release to be cut.

[https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306](https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306)

From reading this, the issue has been mitigated and was caused by a bad relay that was gamed. From my undestanding -

Before:

1. Relay sends validator the header (withholds block so not to get frontrun) for signature, but the block is invalid.
2. Validator signs header
3. Relay sends validator the block
4. Relay attempts to publish the block but cannot because it is invalid.
5. Validator selects the top half of each sandwich from inside the block and MEVs them by putting their own tx in a different proposed block
6. No race between the two blocks because the relay block is invalid.
7. Validator gets slashed for 1ETH afterwards, walks away with $20M.

After:

Step 4 and step 3 are reversed. And Relay does not send the block if it cannot publish it first.

Edit: fixed slashing comment, slashed later.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12b9hj4/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2023/jey1oe3/)

How do you think this would resonate to someone outside of our space?

The internet and information age fundamentally changed how humans interact. Before the internet, blogs were called newspapers, politics & entertainment came through cable TV, and social media was the local bar or a town hall.

Today, there is a quieter, second revolution of the information age taking place. Once again, we are reimagining how humans interact. Just as with the rise of the computers and the internet this new frontier is ripe with opportunity.

The ideas that have captured the minds of these participants may sound as unlikely to you as the internet systems we take for granted today would have in 1990. Eventually this revolution is likely to affect everything money can touch just as the internet did for information. These tools will democratize access to opportunities previously withheld from you and control over these systems will flow to a new generation of tech enthusiasts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Billionaires are already being born of this.

Keep reading and I will introduce you to the new digital scarcity and human coordination tools powering this revolution. I will carve out a landscape of opportunity for you to explore further and help keep you safe while doing so.

Money shapes the world. We are programming our values into our money. By doing so we are reshaping the world.

<summary>u/austonst covers the post-mortem on the MEV exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12c90ok/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2023/jf0ppeq/)

A [post-mortem has been published](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540) about the mev-boost-relay incident a few days ago. The [attack has been](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/) covered [here before](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jesz8la/). But the post-mortem has more details, particularly about the different forms the attack can take, and the mitigations applied.

In general relays are now addressing a whole category of attacks that had been previously overlooked, in which the proposer is able to get access to the transactions in a block to be proposed before they're supposed to. Generally this results in the proposer getting slashed but the MEV can more than make up for it. Attacks include:

* The original form of the attack, in which the proposer signs and submits an invalid block, which the relay accepts, returning the tx contents and giving the proposer a chance to modify bundles as they see fit. Patched (but with some potential side-effects).
* A follow-up to the first form. After the patch, the relay won't return the tx's directly, but a savvy attacker could try to peer a beacon client as close as possible to the relay's nodes, and watch for the block as it begins to propagate around the network. If they can very quickly grab it, modify bundles, create a new block, and use a fast block distribution network to propagate it faster than the original, they might be able to pull off a similar attack. Not entirely solved, still an open question about how to make sure relays will always win the race.
* A form of multi-block attack; /u/t0bii just about [figured this one out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12b9hj4/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2023/jewlml6/). If a validator has two slots in a row, then in slot 1 they deliberately call getPayload late, knowing that they're going to miss the slot. But the relay still reveals the tx's, and since slot 1 is going to be missed, the proposer can modify the bundles and instead include them in slot 2, stealing all the value. Patched, but it's not a perfect fix and may have some serious side effects.

I assume that now that the post-mortem is out, the people more involved in the fixes (Flashbots, ultra sound, EF) are fairly confident that the main attack vectors are decently well patched up. So hopefully things will start to settle down a bit: it's been a busy couple of days at Aestus.

Finally, I want to emphasize a few parts of the post-mortem:

> It is critical that Ethereum has an MEV marketplace that is democratic and efficient. Vulnerabilities like those detailed in this post undermine the integrity of the MEV marketplace and the experience of its users. We call on the security, research, and open source communities to join us in hardening mev-boost and future enshrined PBS designs.

and

> First, we’d like to note mev-boost and the mev-boost-relay both have bug bounty programs. A potentially expanded bug bounty program is being coordinated.
> 
> Second, we encourage searchers to think carefully about how much MEV their strategies expose, willingly or inadvertently, given the extremely adversarial nature of the MEV market and to take actions to mitigate potential attacks. In light of recent events, we ask searchers to reevaluate all risks in the marketplace: code risks, networking risks, reorg risks, smart contract risks, etc. and manage their risks appropriately.
> 
> Third, we call on the research and security community to carefully study vulnerabilities like these in the context of enshrined PBS, where variants may be applicable.
> 
> Finally, this is a call for your contributions, as a community, to ensure a healthy and robust PBS market today and into the future
