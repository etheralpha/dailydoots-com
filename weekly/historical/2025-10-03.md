<summary>u/TheMoondanceKid covers Vanguard cozying up crypto while u/cryptOwOcurrency sheds light on how they got there</summary>

[u/TheMoondanceKid](https://reddit.com/u/TheMoondanceKid):

Vanguard- the world's second largest asset manager with $10T(*edited, h/t labrav*) AUM- is capitulating and will be offering their clients access to crypto ETF's due to client demand. Probably nothing tho.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

> **Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji**, a 10-year BlackRock veteran, oversaw the launch of BlackRock’s wildly successful Bitcoin ETF IBIT [...] **Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year**, many wonder if he will take a page from his former boss Larry Fink’s playbook.

Vanguard just changed leadership from an anti-crypto CEO to a pro-crypto CEO. So of course this means they stop what the old CEO wanted and start what the new CEO wants. No capitulation here.

That being said, the decision to restrict self-directed accounts from purchasing crypto ETFs was idiotic in the first place. No shit there's "strong client demand".

It's actually insane that Vanguard, famous for being the #1 most financially stable and ideologically consistent brokerage in the world, is flip-flopping their stance on crypto one year after the next. The only force powerful enough to get Vanguard to 180 on a key policy like this (which they've never done in the history of the company) is a wall street establishment that (1) fudded crypto and made it hard to buy, (2) loaded up their bags, and (3) are ready to pump it now, after shaking retail out.

*The Race To Rewire Wall Street: Is Ethereum The Safest Bet?*

Good piece on Forbes, based on an interview with Danny Ryan. He seems to be an effective evangelizer.

<summary>u/DepartedQuantity explains the many ways in which Solana is barely decentralised and u/Numerous_Ruin_4947 delivers more centralisation numbers</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nrmmqe/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2025/nggi1cp/)

[u/DepartedQuantity](https://reddit.com/u/DepartedQuantity):

Not just 400TB. More centralization risks:

Around 65% of the Solana supply is owned by the foundation and VCs. 

Solana validators need to be located in a datacenter in order to meet its performance requirements. More specifically the 10Gbps dedicated symmetrical link.

All current validators are part of the Solana Delegation Program where each validator has a portion of their staked supply is owned by the Foundation.

It's estimated that for a validator to be break even, it costs about $14M.

Solana is planning on relying heavily on Starlink to achieve its 150ms finalization target, as current worldwide ping is closer to 250ms.

[u/Numerous_Ruin_4947](https://reddit.com/u/Numerous_Ruin_4947):

Solana’s current account model, where all state is stored on-chain and indefinitely replicated across validators, has delivered simplicity, security, and composability. However, by mid-2025, this model has produced significant challenges: a 500 GB live state, a **400+ TB unpruned ledger**, high validator hardware costs, and unsustainable rent fees for developers. Without intervention, state growth will threaten network decentralization, reduce developer accessibility, and degrade Solana’s competitive edge as a high-performance blockchain.

[https://medium.com/@fireblast963/solanas-path-to-sustainable-scalability-archival-state-mechanisms-with-on-chain-proofs-4d642ee5c5d8](https://medium.com/@fireblast963/solanas-path-to-sustainable-scalability-archival-state-mechanisms-with-on-chain-proofs-4d642ee5c5d8)

Look at the validator specs!

Running a Solana validator requires:

* **≥384 GB RAM**.
* **High-speed NVMe storage (2×3.84 TB enterprise drives)**.
* Monthly costs of **$500–$1,000**, excluding redundancy.

The effect: a validator landscape skewed toward **data centers and professionals**, limiting decentralization.

<summary>u/haurog keeps us in the loop with ethOS and the dGEN1 phone</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nu4e48/daily_general_discussion_september_30_2025/nh1urzr/)

For those interested in what ethOS (the Ethereum phone) people are doing. They just released the first video of a dGEN1 in action: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iZjyIhlBIc>

The video goes through how their wallet works, how they integrate with other dapps and their own dappstore. They wallet is an account abstraction wallet where the private keys never leave the device, but they have the option to recover a wallet using an NFC card which can recover a wallet on a different phone. They also allow to set a backup address which can recover the wallet, but it is not recommended at the moment. 

To me it looks like they wrote quite some custom code for this device. The second narrow screen at the bottom has additional information for the transactions and the dot matrix changes depending on the state of the transaction. They also have a gas account which you can load up and then transact on any chain, even though you do not have any ETH on that chain. Personally, I am not sure how good the user experience will be using the wallet, but in the video it looks much smoother than I expected. 

In general dGEN1 runs GrapheneOS which is a security focused fork of Android with all the google tracking taken out by default. Might be that freedomfactory, the company behind the dGEN1, tweaked the base GrapheneOS a bit to run on their devices, but I have no information if and how much they did that. 

The first dGEN1 devices have been sent out a few weeks ago, but only to a select few KOLs. As far as I understand they are not allowed to talk about the device publicly. No idea why, but I guess that is the reason why almost only still images of people using the device are around and no reviews yet. Maybe they want to maximize the publicity by having a fixed date for first reviews so that more people start ordering the device. 

Yesterday, the broader public received their first shipping confirmations. Many people who burned their dGEN1 NFT in June have received one. I guess in the next few weeks we will see the first devices in the hand of users. I am actually curious how usable the interface is. When I got my NFT last December I honestly did not believe to receive a device and fully expected the project to fail, just because building smartphones can be very hard, especially with all the additional features they have (2nd narrow screen and dot matrix) and then building an additional wallet on top does not make it easier. So, I am pretty happy with the state of the project and looking forward getting mine soonish and playing with it.

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth shares the EF's Project Mirror 2025</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nu4e48/daily_general_discussion_september_30_2025/nh2li5a/)

Has anyone here already shared Project Mirror 2025?

It's an EF commissioned sentiment analysis report started in March and finished in June. The EF is releasing it now.

It's a pretty brutal self-criticism play to share these so publicly, especially when ETH is now performing better and Ethereum is on a good streak.

60+ people were interviewed from many crypto and non crypto backgrounds, including regulators. There's one literally about Vitalik being too nerdy to be the face of Ethereum, and I'm softening the wording here, to be honest.

<summary>u/FlamesRiseHigher took some profits and starts a discussion about how it's often the right thing to do</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nuzfke/daily_general_discussion_october_01_2025/nh67qk5/)

Well after holding since early 2017, I finally sold some of my ETH during this most recent dip to put some money down on a house. I'd like to think any gains from here on out are because of this decision. Feel free to thank me for my sacrifice anytime. It was wholly unselfish, I did it for all of you.

The crab must be vanquished.

<summary>u/haurog gives us a debrief on how the Fusaka upgrade went on testnet</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nuzfke/daily_general_discussion_october_01_2025/nh5l8op/)

The Holesky testnet just got its Fusaka upgrade a few minuts ago. Everything looks ok, at least from my perspective. I lost a few peers (as expected), but seem to be on the same chain as others. According to the dora beaconchain explorer there are more than 75% of all validators on the same chain, so we might finalize in the next 10 minutes or so. 

If the testnet keeps stable over the next few hours that is a very good first indication of that the Fusaka upgrade is potentially ready for mainnet.

UPDATE: Paritosh from the ethpandaops team said that the upgrade looks good on first glance. There are some smaller issues (mostly operators not updating in time), but nothing worrisome. They are also looking at some orphaned blocks to try and see what the cause might be. Holesky also just finalized, which is great. The ethpandaops team do their EIPs testing on holesky now and we will hear from them again in a few hours  to see if everything works as expected.
