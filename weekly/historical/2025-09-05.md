Bitcoin Rug Pull continuETH.

same whale that moved a couple of $billion from btc to eth a few days ago is doing some more now. i can't be bothered to go back thru the history of it but seems he had $6B btc and is less than half way thru.

<summary>u/rhythm_of_eth starts an interesting discussion about BETH</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n2yioz/daily_general_discussion_august_29_2025/nbdw7sj/)

Jumping here with my 5 minutes of stable internet connection to say my piece on BETH, recently announced ETH burn experiment. A cousin of the wrapped ETH/WETH experiment. <https://github.com/ETHCF/beth>

In summary, BETH is an ERC-20 issued when you intentionally and irreversibly burn ETH, and it's got me thinking.

BETH, and all the DeFi sub-ecosystem it can create, can be a very interesting experiment...

- Apps, DAOs and L2s could start requiring proof of burn as a Sybil resistant stake (i.e. governance tied to irreversible ETH burn)
- Extending on that, BETH can become a speculative secondary market for governance rights, membership, reputation, and cultural status akin to many famous NFT collections...
- Its meme potential could help start a coordination primitive of virtue signaling for L2s alignment with L1 while simultaneously contributing to ETH scarcity. A cultural norm that can go beyond just "holding" forever is virtually showing you've burned it forever/irreversibly.

On the other hand though, I can see BETH being virtually inaccessible at scale, and only meaningful for big players, enhancing the ETH hoarding dynamics of DATs and thus reinforcing a plutocracy in Ethereum.

The fact that it's a ERC-20 with transfer functionality makes me think this will end up pegged to ETH or even run at premium or below depending on Ethereum network sentiment as a whole. It's a very interesting experiment honestly. 

Many L2s could accept both BETH and ETH as a gas fee token even.  And with account abstraction, could there be a world where some operations could be paid with BETH (paymasters in ERC-4337)?

What are your thoughts?

<summary>u/growthepie_eth puts into context the extreme growth of stablecoins on Ethereum mainnet into context</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n3t3ie/daily_general_discussion_august_30_2025/nbkc3sg/)

Yesterday Ethereum Mainnet added over $2.4 Billion to its stablecoin supply - Let's put some context behind those numbers  
  
$250.72 = US average daily income (hourly pay $31.34 x 8 hours worked= $250.72)  
$2,416,350,024 / $250.72 = 9,637,643   
So Ethereum adding $2.4 Billion in a day is like 9.6 Million Americans onboarding their daily income to Ethereum. 

...  

Putting 9.6 million people into perspective, that's more than the population of Austria and more than the working population of most US states.   

...  

The population of El Salvador is only 6.4 million with a 60% employment rate and an avg monthly wage of $365. We are looking at $1.4 Billion for monthly wages in El Salvador.. Ethereum did $2.4 Billion in stablecoins in a day and that's not including increases on Layer 2s.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard points out that retail is not here</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n4m3vn/daily_general_discussion_august_31_2025/nbr23q8/)

A channel I pop by infrequently posted [a bull video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smy43vRAcIU&ab_channel=AndreiJikh) on Ethereum. There's very little there we don't already know but this guy is a decent barometer for mid-stage influencer opinion and early retail sentiment. The comments, just like everywhere I go outside of this sub, are full of entirely unsubstantiated hate. There's not a single argument to be had of substance. The most common reply is just that the flippening is entirely delusional with no reasoning stated and ETH is bad because the price is underperforming which is *always* the argument. BTC maxis in full control.

Meanwhile:

1) A Bitcoin whale has recently traded over $3B BTC for ETH and has another $5B in the tank. Seems to be moving 1k BTC about once a day.

2) Treasury companies have accumulated $20B worth of ETH since mid April.

3) ETH ETFs have accumulated another $9B ETH since mid April. ETF flows for ETH are dominating BTC flows. ETH volume has even flipped BTC volume multiple times now despite the multiple in market cap.

4) ETH exchange reserves are cliffing down now that OTC desks are running empty and have to refill. Down 700k ETH this week, 1.2M ETH in August.

Who is buying? Not retail. Wall street, retirement accounts, institutions, etc. So... retail is primed to miss out on this run because of essentially mindless, unsubstantiated hate because they got burned once upon a time by NFTs or something. By the time they buy in, ETH might actually already be at $10k and they'll be exit liquidity for us. It's shocking watching this happen in real time. Most hated rally ever.

<summary>u/HowMuchIsTheDog explains how stablecoins are already Ethereum's killer app</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n5fv68/daily_general_discussion_september_01_2025/nbt1z17/)

Everyone is looking for the killer app for blockhains but it is already here: stablecoins.

$283 billion worth of them have been issued. This is such a large number that it is almost impossible to fathom how far they have spread.

Ethereum is the leader in this space with an 56% market share of all stablecoins issued and it has been climbing as of late.

I wouldn't be shocked if multiple countries unofficially transmission to using stablecoins "fully".

All this will eventually lead to a higher price for Eth. Once L2 stop only leeching and start paying, this activity will translate to a higher price of Eth.

They are spreading EVERYWHERE, here is a short summary how they are been currently used around the world thanks to a friendly llm:

Philippines (OFW remittances): A nurse in Dubai cashes out to her family in Cebu by sending USDC to a Coins.ph wallet; relatives pick up pesos at Palawan Pawnshop branches within minutes—fees lower than typical remittance rails. 

Nigeria → China (SME imports): A Lagos auto-parts importer settles a Shenzhen invoice in stablecoins (often USDT) to dodge FX bottlenecks and long bank delays—mirroring patterns Chainalysis notes (African firms paying suppliers abroad with stablecoins). 

Turkey (inflation hedge): A family keeps next month’s rent in USDT and converts to lira right before paying; Turkey ranks among the highest globally for stablecoin spending (\~4% of GDP) amid persistent inflation pressure. 

Argentina (freelancer payouts): A designer chooses USDC withdrawals via Remote/Stripe instead of local bank wires, avoiding blue-rate headaches and getting paid same-day to a self-custody wallet. 

Ukraine (humanitarian cash): Displaced households receive aid in USDC via Stellar Aid Assist; they show ID and convert at MoneyGram locations to local currency—cutting friction versus card/bank distribution. 

Mexico & Brazil (dollar savings in-app): Everyday users park pesos/real into “digital dollars” through Mercado Pago (USDP in Mexico; a branded dollar token in Brazil), using stablecoins as a low-volatility store of value. 

US/EU ecommerce (checkout & settlement): A Shopify brand toggles on USDC checkout (via Stripe/Coinbase); shoppers pay on Base, while the merchant can auto-settle to bank fiat or keep USDC for treasury. 

Eurozone corporate treasury: A finance team uses SocGen-FORGE’s EURCV (MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin) for after-hours intra-group transfers and vendor settlements; BCB Markets now distributes EURCV to clients. 

Kenya (wallet → mobile money): A Nairobi freelancer gets USDC from an overseas client and off-ramps to M-Pesa via partners like Kotani/TransFi—bridging on-chain dollars to local mobile money rails. 

Russia–China trade (sanctions-strained banking): Some cross-border deals are reportedly settled in USDT to bypass months-long bank delays—documented in reporting on Beijing–Moscow corridors. (Descriptive, not an endorsement.)

<summary>u/KuDeTa takes a moment to appreciate client diversity</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n6aqbw/daily_general_discussion_september_02_2025/nbz942g/)

The latest versions of reth encountered a critical liveness [bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/18205) last night that completely halts syncing. A couple of relays are offline, and some validators were briefly down too. While we await a fix, it's always good to remind ourselves that client diversity really matters. Check your validators.

<summary>u/eth2353 gives credit where it is due for Lido's continued journey towards decentralisation</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n6aqbw/daily_general_discussion_september_02_2025/nc128p3/)

[Big changes coming to Lido?](https://research.lido.fi/t/contributor-thoughts-on-the-future-of-lido-core/10616)

**Contributor Thoughts on the Future of Lido Core**

A new proposal was posted on Lido's governance forum earlier today. It's a bit long (for good reason) but at the same time, a good read for anyone interested in the dynamics of the ETH staking space.

If you don't feel like going through the whole thing, here's my attempt at a summary. Just keep in mind this skips some of the nuance, and it's only a proposal for now.

___

**Curated Module Fee Changes**

The main theme is that staking is getting more competitive, with staking service providers charging ever lower fees (as low as 1-3%). Lido therefore plans to introduce different tiers to their Curated operator set, who are all currently earning the same fee of 5% of total staking rewards. The new tier-based model will try to take into account how much each operator contributes to the broader staking space, and reward operators accordingly. The following tiers are proposed:

- Standard Tier -> \~3.5%
- Client Team Tier -> \~4.5%
- Extra Effort Tier -> \~4% - (running diverse setups or based in underrepresented regions)

> The proposed changes reflect the higher expectations of Node Operators participating in the Curated Module

_Personally I’ve always considered the expectations for the curated set were far too low, so this is nice to see._

___

**Staking Router V3**

A big update to Lido's staking router is coming to enable, among others, validator consolidations. This could unlock a large amount of validator consolidations on the network, leading to a more efficient network that can scale further.

This update also introduces the concept of a Validator Marketplace, which allows Lido to distribute and reallocate stake across their different modules more dynamically.

___

**Curated Module v2**

The curated module is expected to undergo big changes, taking inspiration from the Community Staking Module. This should allow for more flexibility in terms of rewards based on different operator types.

___

That's it! It will be interesting to see how this evolves and gets implemented over the coming year or so.

Credit where credit's due: Lido has been investing significantly into decentralizing and improving their operator set. Hundreds of thousands of ETH are currently staked via their Simple DVT module, operated by hundreds of different node operators including home stakers.  They could’ve just stuck with their curated set and called it a day, instead they have been making a serious effort to improve. I hope these proposed changes help take it to the next level with an even more diverse and robust operator set.

<summary>u/InsuranceGuyQuestion explains the shift in mindset as old holders sell out of their positions and new entities enter</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1n6aqbw/daily_general_discussion_september_02_2025/nc50pds/)

As older investors exit and new investors enter, many will begin to see ETH as having a "guaranteed" price range of $3K-$4K. This mindset encourages them to keep buying whenever they view the price as a bargain. As ETH consistently holds above $4K, it signals strong activity on both the buying and selling sides, a transfer of wealth to new holders who now perceive ETH as a $4K asset. Over time, sellers themselves will start accepting $4K as the new baseline, reducing sell pressure, while buyers continue to accumulate. This dynamic eventually tips the balance toward demand outweighing supply, which can trigger sharp upward movement.

We’ve seen the same with Bitcoin. It’s unlikely BTC will ever revisit $1K or even $10K. The price has matured, and every dip finds strong support, making further downside increasingly difficult. The same principle applies to ETH: a return to $10, $100, or similar past lows is improbable. Treasury firms and large buyers have established new “floors,” and their strategy of scaling up purchases during dips creates immense support. This sustained buying pressure builds new baseline prices that are unlikely to break.

This cycle happens across all assets. No one thinks of NVDA as a $2 stock anymore, wealth rotation and market psychology have permanently reset expectations. The longer ETH maintains higher levels, the stronger that psychological and market-driven support becomes.

Even now, people call $100K Bitcoin’s strong support and speculate on $1M targets. It may sound extreme, but the order books reflect reality: billions of dollars in buy orders are waiting at $100K. That support is real, and it strengthens as BTC stays above that level. ETH is undergoing the same process over time, steadily building its own strong price floors.

Overall, an asset staying flat is actually a good sign that it's strengthening.
