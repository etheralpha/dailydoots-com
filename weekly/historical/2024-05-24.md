It is a tale as old as time. In the days of yore it was the exploitation of serfs and the indentured servitude of the layman for the few pulling the strings at the top. Nowadays it is venture capitalists going public once market saturation is reached and multinational corporations squeezing the last drop of profits through shrinkflation and enshittification so that they can buy up all of the family homes in western nations.

It was said, that one day the tables would turn. Some thought that was the communist revolution in Russia, but we all know how that turned out. Other more shrewd folks have been saying that the wealth flippening has yet to come and is almost upon us. The time is nigh. I can feel it in my loins.

From 2009 onwards, for the first time in history, the little guy could get access to new financial primitives from the very beginning. Following Bitcoin's unprecedented rise, there was a second opportunity with the Ethereum ICO which launched in 2014. Open to all, the gateway into a new financial system had opened. Sometime in 2017, I somehow stumbled my way onboard this movement and that's despite being a broke university student. But that didn't matter. That's just how big this opportunity was. Shortly afterwards, the long rumoured flippening was supposedly on the table — no, not the ETH/BTC flippening — the flippening which the lower and middle class have been waiting for since the dawn of time. The flippening of financial opportunity.

For once, the incumbent, antiquated systems designed to entrench wealth amongst the upper class was holding them back from the latest opportunity. The gatekeepers of TradFi tasked with keeping the everyday man "safe" from the best wealth building opportunities now found themselves gatekeeping the rich and powerful out of the biggest opportunity yet. At first they laughed. Such an opportunity couldn't be anything other than a bubble! But the bubble showed no signs of popping. Soon, they realised that they had to fight it or else it would become entrenched on its own, outside of the existing system. Knowing better, the grassroots community building out this new paradigm did not yield. With every line of code and every battle fought in court, their new system became stronger, more resilient.

And so here we are. Sitting on the precipice of this long rumoured flippening. The cycle is nearly complete. Upon realising the inevitable game theory of a superior technology in an adversarial and capitalist world, the Finks of the world made their intentions clear and the gatekeepers could no longer stand in their way. The future is tokenised and the future is public. The big gates are opening. For the first time in human history, the people have had the opportunity to front run the establishment. The established has become the exit liquidity. The institutions are coming.

It has been an honour being on this ride with you, gents. Not only has this opportunity been once in a lifetime, it has been once in an aeon. Gentlemen is imminent.

Lol just kidding. Larry, you can pry my ETH from my cold, dead hands. This solo staker ain't going anywhere. If you're lucky you can have my staking rewards for a pretty penny.

<summary>u/Belligerent_Chocobo shares some reason for optimism</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ct57il/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2024/l4cjk33/)

Okay you debbie downers, here's some small bits of optimism:

1) [Article highlighting growing tokenization push by TradFi,](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/16/dtcc-chainlink-complete-pilot-to-accelerate-fund-tokenization-with-jpmorgan-templeton-bny-mellon-participating/) this time in the form of a pilot project involving some TradFi heavyweights (bonus - in article, note the image referring to DTCC's Ethereum network... every time I read about tokenization, it always seems to be riding on Ethereum's rails)

2) Yesterday, BTC [broke out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1sQsHDua/) of its downward trend since March, and is also just over its 50 day SMA. Yes yes, I know many here love to shit on TA, and Bitcoin for that matter, but a rising tide lifts all boats, and this *could* be telling us that the worst of the pain is over (which isn't to say we won't go sideways for months). Concurrent ATH's on the S&P and Nasdaq don't hurt, either.

3) Look, ETH ETF denial is priced in. And not only that, I'd go as far as to say that if the main reason for denial is some bullshit like 'weak correlation between spot and futures', ETH's price is likely to see a nice bounce. And *even if* the SEC goes the 'it's a security' route, I'm still not even convinced that it'll be bad for price. After all, the market has already been digesting this possibility for months, and there will at least be less *uncertainty*, something markets loathe. Anecdotally, back in January 2017 when the the Winklevii BTC spot ETF got rejected (right around halving time, not unlike now), BTC briefly spiked down before rocketing up throughout the balance of the year. I'm not saying it's an exact analog, but rather--it always seems darkest before dawn.

Now quit yer bitchin!

<summary>u/physalisx shares a research piece that's bullish on Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ctx7h5/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2024/l4fydke/)

Not sure if this was posted here already, maybe I didn't spot it between all the whining. 

Coinbase published a [research piece about their Ethereum outlook](https://www.coinbase.com/en-de/institutional/research-insights/research/monthly-outlook/monthly-outlook-may-2024). 

tl;dr: they're as bullish as ever

>We think that ETH may yet have the potential to surprise to the upside in
the coming months. ETH does not appear to have major sources of supply
side overhangs such as token unlocks or miner sell pressure. To the
contrary, both staking and L2 growth have proven to be meaningful and
growing sinks of ETH liquidity. ETH’s position as the center of DeFi is also
unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the
EVM and its L2 innovations.

>That said, the importance of potential spot US ETH ETFs cannot be
understated. We think the market may be underestimating the timing and
odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside.
In the interim, we believe the structural demand drivers for ETH as well as
the technological innovations within its ecosystem will enable it to continue
straddling across multiple narratives

<summary>u/eth2353 covers the appeal of the Alexey Pertsev Tornado Cash case and u/Defacticool shares their take as someone involved with European law</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ctx7h5/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2024/l4hbfdw/)

[u/eth2353](https://reddit.com/u/eth2353):

In the interest of keeping you updated on the Tornado Cash case in the Netherlands against Alexey Pertsev, his legal team [filed an appeal with the local court of appeals](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/16/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-appeals-guilty-verdict/) right away, on the day of the verdict. It is not yet clear whether the appeal has been approved, but the good news is, according to some sources Alexey is free on bail for the time being.

Since I'm not a lawyer I didn't feel qualified to objectively judge the court's verdict, I like to leave these things to subject matter experts. Thankfully, today a local Dutch law firm published [an article (in English!)](https://hertoghsadvocaten.nl/en/kennisbank/tornado-cash-the-developer-as-co-perpetrator-of-money-laundering/) analysing the verdict and concluding: "From my perspective, the judgment fails to address these questions adequately, indicating that it is ripe for appeal."

Here's what I found most interesting:

> **The role of Pertsev in Tornado Cash**
> 
> The court asserts that Pertsev, alongside co-suspects Roman Storm and Roman Semenov—who are under prosecution in the US—are the creators of Tornado Cash. They engineered the system to function autonomously and immutably. Since the system’s basic operations were unalterable from the outset, the court holds these individuals are and remain accountable for its functionality.
> 
> In December 2020, the governance of Tornado Cash was transferred to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), meaning its governance structure was by then overseen by the community. However, the court concludes that the foundational operations of the system were unchangeable and, therefore, the original setup by the founders remains a critical factor.
> 
> **Co-perpetration Concerns**
> 
> The court’s reasoning on co-perpetration seems flawed to me. It suggests that Tornado Cash, let’s call it a digital platform or system, independently enacted the acts of hiding and concealing cryptocurrency with a criminal origin. This implies that a system can engage in criminal behaviour on its own—an unusual and potentially problematic interpretation, as it shifts the criminal conduct itself from individuals to systems. [...] This could have significant implications for software developers if tools are perceived as independently capable of criminal actions, making the developers responsible for the tool’s ‘actions’.
> 
> **Questioning criminal intent**
> 
> Another aspect open to criticism is how the court motivates Pertsev’s criminal intent. [...] The court’s assumption that the general knowledge that mixers could be used for criminal activities was enough to establish Pertsev’s intent for these specific transactions is questionable.
> 
> The court argues it is common knowledge that mixers are used by criminals, citing a report by the Financial Action Task Force and the classification by the Financial Intelligence Unit in The Netherlands dated August 15, 2017, that the use of a mixer is a money laundering typology. [...] Does foreseeing that your software might be used by criminals make you criminal liable for their actions? And what did Pertsev know at that moment in time, as the assumed common knowledge in 2019 is highly debatable? The case file might indicate Pertsev was aware of criminal usage of Tornado Cash at some point, but this does not necessarily relate to his actions at the time he set up the system or to the timing of the specific transactions.
> 
> I believe the judgment for Pertsev’s criminal intent was poorly motivated, and the legal intricacies remain underexplored. An appeal will be necessary to address these issues thoroughly.

[u/Defacticool](https://reddit.com/u/Defacticool):

As someone in a legal field in a different EU country (Sweden), I cant say anything about dutch law necessarily.

But if our system is any indication of their system, it wouldnt at all be surprising if the lowest courts is a coinflip of whether theyre reasonable and rational or batshit. 

And it also would surprise me if their lower courts (in this case and in general) defer to the "common sense" conclusion simply because this case is so novel, and leave it to higher courts to delve into the nuances if they deem it reasonable to do so. 

Stupid as it may sound a lower court (so less authority, lowest hierarchy, little to none precedential power) may well decide to err on the side of simplicity because it recognises the complicated nature of a novel legal question is above their paygrade and they could throw a wrench in the gears by trying to "properly" deal with the complication. 

At the same time a universal legal principle is that for criminal law the courts should side on the benefit of the defendant, where the law isnt entirely clear. So its not like I'm happy with the situation. 

Also I will say that a reason for why the lower courts being tolerated for what they are here in sweden is because we have an automatic right to appeal (it cant be denied) to the second level courts. So a criminal case will always be tried at a second instance if the defendant wants it to. 

I cant find online if the dutch have a similar systems, but if they do it would also go a long way to explain why a lower court may be less hesitant to be more stringent to a defendant. 

The dutch also seem to have a more professionalist second instance of a tribunal of 3 judges, so the risk of the important questions simply being ignored is significantly lesser than in a trial with a single arbiter.

<summary>u/interweaver explains the 2022 MEV theft exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cupmmt/daily_general_discussion_may_18_2024/l4m90l4/)

So Ethereum processes lots of user transactions. Those transactions are submited to many places, but commonly the public mempool that is maintained by all the Ethereum nodes. Validators propose new blocks to add to the blockchain, and they are the party that gets to decide which transactions, and in which order, those new blocks contain. If they do this themself, it is called "local block building"; but in practice, most validators use a piece of software called MEV-Boost (more on why it's called that shortly) to receive built blocks from external builders, who pay the validator for the privilege of selecting the block's contents. Those blocks are passed to the validator via a "neutral" third party called a relay.

Now, many of those user transactions "leave money on the table" in one form or another, and clever third parties can take that money, which we call MEV, for themselves. They usually do that with the use of bots.

A common (and relevant here) example of MEV would be sandwiching, in which a user submits a transaction for a dex trade, but with a relatively large slippage set, which means that the market can move by that percentage from where the user saw it, and the trade is still valid. A MEV bot that is able to see that transaction before it goes through (which is easy if it was submitted to the public mempool) can come along and frontrun/backrun the transaction, by taking a large amount of money (often VERY large) and making their own trade on the dex, moving the price in a direction disadvantageous to the victim, then letting the victim's trade go through (losing some money due to slippage), and then going back in with the backrun tx and recovering all their starting money, plus some extra that came from the victim's slippage.

It is of extreme importance (for the MEVer) that that sequence of three transactions (frontrun, victim trade, backrun) happen in exactly that order, without any other transactions in between, because potentially those other transactions might also trade on the same dex, and might do the "wrong" thing versus what the MEVer wanted, i.e. trading in the opposite direction from the victim transaction, which would result in the MEVer losing money instead of the victim. So these transactions are submitted in "bundles" by the MEV bot to the external block builder; the block builder promises to keep those bundles in exactly that order and without anything in between. That allows the MEV exploit to successfully take the money the victim transaction "left on the table". It is essential that the MEVer can trust the builder to leave their bundles alone.

An excellent question at this juncture: the validator has to sign off on blocks that they submit. Why couldn't the validator see all of the transactions in the block and mess with the MEV transactions themself? The answer is that MEV-Boost is designed such that the relay just passes the validator the *header* of the block, which is the thing that needs signing. The validator has no idea what's in the block, or if it is even valid, when they sign it. This is a fairly trusting thing to do, but the ecosystem has accepted it. Back in 2023, as soon as the validator signed the header, the relay would send the rest of the contents of the block to the validator (who could now see the MEV transactions, but has already signed that version of the block, and so cannot change the block, at risk of getting slashed), and the validator would broadcast the block body to the network, and everything is hunky dory.

So that's all necessary context for what happened. These smart brothers from MIT realized that in some cases, it's actually worth it to get slashed. They set up their own validators, got some bot code ready to go, and waited.

When it was their turn to propose a block, they received the block header from the relay via MEV-Boost, signed it and sent it back, and were sent the block body (with all the transactions) like usual. But instead of broadcasting that block, they looked at the transactions, and saw that there were some juicy MEV sandwiches going on inside there. (In fact, they had made sure of that, by putting their own 'victim' transactions into the public mempool to bait the sandwich bot, once they knew they were going to be proposing.) And their bot unbundled those MEV sandwiches and did the thing the MEVers assumed no one could do: they inserted their own dex transaction in between the sandwich frontrun and backrun, going the "wrong way". They did this in such a way that essentially all of the sandwich bot's money, which again can be a LARGE amount, and in this case was around $25M, was eaten up by their inserted transaction. Basically the MEVer got MEV'd.

After *very quickly* doing all this, they took their modified block, signed *that* block, and broadcast it to the network as quickly as possible. Now there were two versions of the block floating around, one the original that they had to sign in order to see the block transactions, and one the modified version that they also had to sign. The modified block won (they made sure of this via another clever trick outside the scope of this post). Of course, signing two blocks is grounds for getting slashed on Ethereum, and their validator did indeed get slashed, losing the usual 1 Eth. 

But the brothers were able to take $25M of the MEVers' money, which they thought was completely safe, but due to this loophole in the way MEV-Boost worked, was actually not. (The loophole was subsequently patched by having the relay broadcast the signed block body to the network for several seconds before sending it back to the validator, so the validator doesn't have a chance of getting their own version of the block accepted).

Was this a crime? I honestly don't know haha. A lot of us were cheering for them at the time, because it was a case of one of the Dark Forest inhabitants who regularly preys on normal users, getting eaten by an even bigger and darker denizen of the Forest. On that battleground, I think a lot of us assume that everything is fair game; if you play that game you'd better be ready to watch your back. But it would appear that the MEVers that got taken advantage of are both wealthy and pissed off, and that's a recipe for lawsuits. We'll see what happens. It will be a fascinating case from the "code is law" perspective - the MEV people will have to argue that this was a crime without also implicating their own entire business model in equivalent crimes haha.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

The following is my current understanding

They have split up the staking into two tokens now. ETH and EIGEN. Before that the goal was to only use ETH. In my understanding, the problem with the old approach was that all the slashing would have happened on ETH, but most slashing conditions for the current round of AVSs are not verifiable on chain. This necessitates that one has to come to an agreement among AVS operators that one of them has to get slashed. Most of the time the conditions are pretty clear and they can come to an agreement. But in the case of malicious majority for a certain AVS, they can slash other operators, steal their ETH and there is nothing one can do, even though it is obvious that they are malicious actors. The only recourse is to make an irregular state transition, which means forking the ethereum chain like for the DAO hack reversal. It would be messy it would hurt Ethereum and is not something one would like to have again. This is in my understanding the issue with overloading the consensus layer. 

In the new system these kind of not fully objective slashing conditions are moved to the EIGEN token. If AVS operators collude to take away EIGEN from one operator, the community will most probably see this as an attack and can just fork away into a new EIGEN token. If the social consensus is that it was a malicious attack, the forked away EIGEN tokens will retain the value and the 'original' EIGEN token will lose its value. This takes a lot of power away from AVS operators and especially allows forking the value and security of the Eigenlayer protocol without forking the underlying Ethereum chain.

This greatly reduces the amount of ETH that is needed in the Eigenlayer protocol which will also reduce the amount of ETH staked in it which again helps with the resilience of Ethereum. Before that change there was the concern that every single ETH will be restaked. I do not see this happening anymore.

As said before, this is my current understanding of Eigenlayer and I am sure I missed some issues the protocol still has. I am definitely happy to learn about them.

Some bad news on Lido staked ETH dominance: [https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/14/lido-co-founders-paradigm-secretly-back-eigenlayer-competitor-as-defi-battle-lines-form/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/14/lido-co-founders-paradigm-secretly-back-eigenlayer-competitor-as-defi-battle-lines-form/)

Paradigm and Lido plan to ship a restaking competitor to Eigenlayer. As you can imagine, Lido stETH deposits would be heavily incentivised in Symbiotic (ironic new name for the product), which will likely shoot up dominance higher.

On a side note: Cobie was a Lido co-founder (dont ask me how or why). Lido obviously foresees the social layer being another cock block for their new product when it ships. Cobies tweets in the past 48h would make more sense with that context.

A word of caution to everyone, old and new here:

Yes, this is one of the most bullish things that has ever happened in the Ethereum ecosystem and for crypto in general. The ramifications are huge. Legistlation was probably the biggest obstacle to the vision of Web 3.0, and now it seems like (and you feel like) the price is going to $5k, $10K, or $150K. I feel like that, too.

So you think to yourself: *Why shouldn't I leverage?* Maybe just 2x? Or 3x... or 10x. Your eyes are flashing with dollar signs. This rocketship can only go straight up, right?

Well, no. We are going up, yes, but the longs are piling atop of longs. A small rumour could move the needle *juuust* enough for a liquidation cascade. Don't let a sudden flash crash destroy what you have been patiently waiting for months, or years.

I can pretty much guarantee that this will happen as we go up. We are going to have 15%-25% red wicks. The volatility just demands it.

I have been burned by these crashes *a lot* when I didn't know better, and I believe I have learned my lesson. Don't do the same mistakes I did. You are not only going to lose money, you are going to fuck up your mental health and sleep, too.

Here, Bitcoiners have it right. The only thing you need to do is ***HODL***. Don't leverage. Don't try to trade the tops and bottoms. You will only give your money to the same whales that made your life miserable this past year. You want to get back to them, and those that fucked with us? The crypto influencers on twitter? The miners that paid to FUD PoS? The haters and shitcoin peddlers? Deny them the chance to have your Ether. Make them beg for it. Make them FOMO like they've never FOMO'd for any coin. Make the market go crazy.

***Fucking Hold On for Dear Life***... spot only, preferably in self-custody!

<summary>u/haurog dives into an interesting observation by an EF researcher</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cxsana/daily_general_discussion_may_22_2024/l54x11k/)

Yesterday, Toni Wahrstätter, an EF researcher, had an interesting talk at Dappcon about block sizes in Ethereum and how the size is distributed. Apparently some builders do not include as many blobs as others because including blobs gives little rewards, but could increase the risk of the block not propagating fast enough in the network and getting re-orged. As far as I understand beaverbuild, the largest builder, does include fewer blobs than Titan builder, the second largest one. Currently this is not a big deal as L2s can just increase the fee tip to make it more attractive to include the blob. But this generally hints at a mispriced resource within the Ethereum protocol. Similar with very large transactions that do not pay a high enough fee due to the very low priced calldata in the EVM.

As far as I see it, this needs to be fixed before increasing the number of blobs per block and probably also before increasing the block gas limit by a large amount.

And he also talks about how he broke sepolia with his super large transaction.

Definitely worth a listen:
