<summary> u/nixorokish shares the amazing new EthStaker website</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/130aejt/daily_general_discussion_april_27_2023/jhwh329/)

If you've ever visited EthStaker's website before, you'll have seen that it was... largely unnavigable. Well - we wanted to build a new, open source one, so we put out a call on r/ethstaker to see if we could find someone from the community, familiar with staking, to help us do it. [u/hanniabu](https://reddit.com/u/hanniabu) is awesome and did it!

So now EthStaker has [a new open source website](https://ethstaker.cc)!! Feedback would be most appreciated, especially from ethfinanciers. What would help you find the info you want about staking? I didn't love giving people discord and subreddit links when they asked for resources, so I'm pretty stoked to be able to give them a website where everything is aggregated.

I'm also gonna post a series of 'beginner guide to staking' blog posts over the next couple weeks (at <https://ethstaker.cc/blog>), would REALLY love feedback on that from someone who *sorta* knows what staking is but wants to know more. Mostly for readability

<summary>u/696_eth discusses a new entrant in the decentralised liquid staking game</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/131i3ej/daily_general_discussion_april_28_2023/ji2w589/)

I looked into DIVA and wrote [a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/696_eth/status/1651804749245870081) about them yesterday.

Here's a quick summary for Ethfinance:

* Diva is a decentralized way of staking
* **Di**stributed **Va**lidation staking thru Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). Trustless. Resilient. Secure. Cause of fully distributed network of validators. Entrance as low as 1E.
* Liquid staking. You would stake to get divETH, which operates kinda like stETH. You can wrap into wdivETH which operates like rETH/wstETH. This can be tax advantageous depending on your preference of incoming vs capital gains.
* You would have an option to run a node for extra rewards (split 50% between stakers and node runners in the final Phase 2 version on the mainnet). There's some minimum hardware requirements. 
* It's currently on the testnet. Should be live on mainnet in Q2

The key points is that I've learned is that combines liquid staking with DVT. Since it uses a smart contract to pool funds it can be as low as 1E. Honestly, I'm waiting for a bit more info after their testnet releases to see how it pricesly protects against penalties and bad actors and why 1E would be safe. Also, not enough info on Node Operators and right now you would not be able to run one on the testnet. 

Side note. SWISE vaults might be in a similar vein I guess.

[An extra useful article](https://divalabs.medium.com/how-diva-is-designing-a-more-trustless-staking-solution-acc96ca5a549)

Please correct me if I misunderstood something or if you wanna educate me more, this was a new concept for me so it was a bit hard wrapping my head around it when figuring out how diva is planning to make it work not just in a theoretical way.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll makes an analogy about crypto legislation</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/132jpw8/daily_general_discussion_april_29_2023/ji5s7ln/)

It's the 1920s, you're starting to see these fancy new self-propelled horseless carriages or "cars" pop up everywhere. They look really cool but they're also quite dangerous. This is what the kerfuffle is about in the congress at the moment. Everyone knows that we need to protect people from the maniacs on the road. But astute observers also realise that we also need to protect the innovation and economic advantage these new-fangled machines provide.

Lawmakers are split on what to do. Representative Emmer thinks we need new laws. "Rules of the road" for all to comply with. Rules which all road users must follow specifically designed to create order out of the chaos on the road while still allowing for fast, efficient travel. But senator Warren disagrees. She thinks these new machines should be treated like horses under the ancient 1839 "Horse and Carriage act". She doesn't care that horses are slow, living creatures which need to eat, sleep and poop while cars are fast, furious and can run all day. She insists that these roads were built for horses and that makes anything on those roads a horse, dammit!

Don't be like senator Warren.

**Edit:** If anyone with some clout on Twitter wants to screenshot this and run with it, go for it. Or if you reckon you can take the idea and shorten it down to the Twitter character limit, that would be impressive so go for it.

Chris Blec posted on twitter and called out rocketpool.  However... hes actually right?

[https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1652498398459699202](https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1652498398459699202)

I looked into oDAO and it is exactly what he describes it as.  

Everything more and more just feels like decentralization theater...

The fact that it is invite only is despicable and counter to any ethos regarding decentralization.

[u/Datacruncha](https://reddit.com/u/Datacruncha):

Ethereum's consensus layer and execution layer currently don't talk to each other so you need oracles for something like rocket pool. The odao does all the oracle work for rocket pool and upgrades the smart contracts. They can technically collude and cause massive damage so the best way to prevent this is to overpay and only include trusted people. Yes, the work is fairly easy and not worth half a million a year and everyone wants a spot. Thankfully, a lot of the money goes to fund client teams which helps ethereum run and keeps it decentralized. 4 spots are allocated to the rocket pool team to help fund development. Sassal donates all his earnings. 

Eventually, there will be less of a need for the odao with upgrades to Ethereum like eip 4788. If anyone has any  technical or economic suggestions about the odao they can post in the rocket pool forum or the research section on discord. Please note, it takes very little effort to criticize and substantial amounts of time and coordinated effort to come up with working solutions.

<summary>u/MerkleChainsaw is looking for real adoption and u/silentjxhn makes a great list of examples</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/134d3x2/daily_general_discussion_may_1_2023/jigbkxt/)

[u/MerkleChainsaw](https://reddit.com/u/MerkleChainsaw):

Long term, I'm very positive that Ethereum will eventually dominate the crypto space and that it will address most major technical challenges, even if it takes another decade or two. I'm pessimistic about crypto overall though.

I'm still on the sidelines because I'm having trouble seeing how crypto overall will achieve *true adoption* anytime soon. I define "true adoption" very narrowly as significant demand for ETH to be used for some external purpose other than crypto speculation or facilitating crypto speculation. So for example providing DEX liquidity, staking/validation, and issuing most tokens or NFTs don't count since the demand is mostly based on putting fiat into crypto hoping to get more fiat out. Things that do count include airline or concert ticket NFTs, using ETH contracts for supply chain tracking or audit, and so on. In these cases someone is willing to buy ETH because they can use it to solve an actual problem. I think most other successful technologies were solving real world problems by this stage in their development.

Where can this adoption come from? After all the scams, fraud, and hacks I'd have trouble convincing any company board to use public blockchains beyond maybe an NFT cash grab offering, if for no better reason than avoiding the reputation risk and liability from using crypto. Even a simple use case like accepting stablecoins as payment is tough because every major stablecoin has depegged at some point.

Though it's small, I think EVMavericks is an example of true adoption. Demand for most people is based on "I'd like to be a member of a club" rather than "I'd like to sell this JPG for a profit". Maybe some Reddit avatars count in this category as well?

Is there anything on the horizon that I'm missing? Financially I want to buy ETH because it has an asymmetric distribution of returns, and I believe Ethereum is one of the only projects in crypto being designed with good intentions and a long term focus. On the other hand I'm increasingly having trouble seeing where enough new demand will come from to justify a $220B valuation.

<summary>u/benido2030 has a monthly staking update</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jikbng0/)

Here's your new monthly staking update: 

**Validator overview - total: 619346 validators\***

* 554322 active
* 18350 pending
* 7333 exiting
* 39341 exited

**Client diversity numbers\*\***

* Consensus: Prysm 38% // Lighthouse 37% // Teku 17% // Nimbus 6% // Lodestar 1%
* Execution: Geth 64% // Nethermind 16% // Erigon 11% // Besu 8%

**Pool distribution\*\*\***

* Unknown 41,8%
* lido 23,3%
* Coinbase 9,6%
* Binance 3,7%
* Kraken 3,5%
* Rocket Pool 2,7%
* \+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc. 

My goal is to show how things develop and answer questions like "How many validators will secure the network by EOY if net new validators are constant", "Is client diversity improving" and "How is the dynamic between centralized pools and decentralized stakers". 

If you think something very important is missing, let me know and I'll add it today or tomorrow, so we can work with it in June. Best case share your source, so I know where to find the stats. 

This post will contain more information and probably some conclusions in the future, I hope this will be a good summary and help for those who don't check numbers regularly (I basically didn't do it and could not tell you how things are developing right now)

**Some comments and sources:**

All percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.

P.S. I wanted to do this yesterday, cause it was the first of the month, but I had no time cause of the bank holiday and also I was too stupid yesterday... So let's pretend today's numbers are those from May 1st.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade has a cool idea for EVMavericks</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jijszul/)

Here's an idea: EVMavericks' ManeNet DAO becoming a Rocket Pool oDAO member.

Aren't we an ideal and trustworthy partner that highly values decentralization?

Edit: just realized how unwelcoming this post must feel to any new member. So let's explain a few things for our most recent friends: 

A while back r/ethfinance launched its own NFT collection, [EVMavericks](https://opensea.io/collection/evmavericks) and used the occasion to launch a DAO, the ManeNet DAO. From [its website](https://dao.evmavericks.xyz/): *"ManeNet DAO advances the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education"*

[Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) is a liquid staking protocol, and the oDAO is *"the group of special Rocket Pool nodes that are responsible for the administrative duties required by the protocol that cannot be achieved by Smart Contracts due to technical limitations".* The "o" in oDAO stands for "oracle".

So basically the idea here is to have an r/ethfinance native DAO help Rocket Pool with some of its duties. This job pays rather well, and the money could, according to the ManeNet DAO's mission, be used to advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/136avsi/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2023/jipex7f/)

Yesterday, u/Ethical-trade made a post about how the EVmavricks should join Rocket Pool's oDAO. I loved that post so much, I covered it in today's Rocket Fuel - making the case that I strongly support them joining. 

I support ManeNet DAO joining the oDAO so strongly that, in the episode, I made the offer of lending the DAO the 1750 RPL needed to cover the bond if they are selected. 

Also, I wore my EVMavricks t-shirt especially for this episode!

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/136avsi/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2023/jio9aln/)

Meanwhile, in NFT-land...

Blur, the incumbent NFT marketplace, just [announced Blend](https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1653101755809562624): a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platform that lets users leverage their NFTs as collateral to borrow ETH. These loans are perpetual (no expiration price or date), at fixed rate. The twist? Lenders can call the loan at any time, triggering a Dutch auction for a new lender to step in and take over the loan.

But wait, there's more! Blend also [announced a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) feature](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/ZieWXcPU3Td_8Ipozx9hw0atASKyjY7WlF1mZiANf0w), enabling users to "buy" their favourite NFTs with just a 20% down payment, while the rest is borrowed from a lending pool. I wrote "buy", because until the price is paid in full, the user can't do anything with the NFT, except for listing it in Blur's marketplace (ie try to sell it back and profit from the move).

As always, with great financialization comes even greater risks. Borrowing ETH to "buy" an NFT (BNPL) means going long on leverage (you profit if the price of the NFT rises). Borrowing an NFT and immediately sell it for ETH (Blend) means leveraging short (you profit if price falls). The result: when NFT values fluctuate in the opposite of the "expected" direction, users will quickly face liquidations.

We will soon see the impact of this development on collection prices. While leverage markets can help stabilise price fluctuations, they can also create massive liquidation cascades, so I'd expect some days of wild rides are ahead.
