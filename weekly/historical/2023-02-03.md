Zero-Knowledge Proof: put simply is

- I know the secret.
- I will not tell you the secret.
- But I can prove to you that I know the secret

and put in even simpler terms:

- your wife is angry at you,
- without giving you any details,
- she proved to you that you did something wrong and she knows it

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the scam that took out a fellow EthFinancier</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10lkzyb/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2023/j5yw3vm/)

Today we will be investigating the scam that took advantage of our friend who came here looking for help yesterday. My inital intent was to remove this campaign from the internet.

Though, as my investigation progressed, I became more and more conscious of the CFAA. I would not discourage anyone who understands the implications from picking up where I left off.

**The Scam**

Loading the domain in your browser will instantly prompt MetaMask to connect. Doing so leads to a fake DEX. You are given a 6 digit ‘ID’ that is displayed on the front page. Below is an example of one of their scam pages.

<https://imgur.com/Wy5NPSb>

This is all over the place. USDT-ERC20, output in ETC. They provide various addresses to deposit your funds. At least one of the addresses provided does not even have an ETH balance – without any gas money, these fraudsters were never planning to return any deposits.

I clicked on the button that was a head with headphones, presumably the support button.

<https://imgur.com/s2V6PAW>

You can ‘Emall’ them at the displayed email address. Visiting the above domain in chrome showed the exact same front end as the scam we’re dealing with.

Frighteningly, they want you to ‘authenticate’.

<https://imgur.com/B9nXvHN>

They ask for your name and email address. Infinitely worse, they want pictures of any forms of your identification, as can be seen below.

<https://imgur.com/iJpMGIj>

Anyone who has completed this form should consider their identity stolen, and contact the appropriate authorities.

**Offense**

To begin to gain some understanding of a website, using ‘view page source’ in your browser is an extremely effective tool.

<https://imgur.com/8q39ows>

The highlighted text is Simplified Chinese for ‘page loaded’. *Quite* interesting.

As an attacker, this file upload form offers a massive attack surface. Of course, an experienced intruder knows what to do here.

But for any ethfinanciers who would like to learn more about this, here are some resources [1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)[2](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)[3](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/unrestricted-file-upload-testing/) or just ask ya boi.

When running a [black box](https://brightsec.com/blog/black-box-penetration-testing/) web application security test, /robots.txt is a critical file to access. This file is used by servers to request that web crawlers such as google not access/archive the list of URLs within the file.

As you might imagine, these often times contain URLs of relative importance. Whether crawlers choose to obey is completely up to them both technically, and legally(not legal advice).

The requested /robots.txt did not directly return any confidential files or directories. Though, it resulted in a fairly signficant information leak.

<https://imgur.com/eJwEEWq>

I unfortunately did not think to translate that Chinese text to English. Do we have any Chinese speaking ethfinanciers who can help out?

Notice that this error leaks a number of file paths on this server.

At the bottom we see that the server uses ThinkPHP 3.2.0, which happens to be vulnerable to a high severity issue.

<https://imgur.com/3l8C9Tf>

I will not fix the URL provided in the description to fit this target simply for the safety of those who do not know exactly what they’re doing. Be very careful before landing yourself in federal prison.

When learning to attack a system, one thing that has to be reinforced is the idea of enumeration. I cannot find a link to an article that accurately articulates what I wish to convey. I would describe it is as the art of testing ideas, taking notes of oddities, and learning everything you can about your target system.

Here’s an example. Screenshots were not taken, but I found that files requested that lack the the extension ‘.php’ resulted in the same error shown in /robots.txt. Is it a vulnerability? No. Is it worth noting if you wish to gain a thorough understanding of your target? Yes.

I've seen *lots* of examples of security researchers bringing down scam websites without facing prosecution, but a number of things made me hesitant in this case.

<https://imgur.com/0j1UzE0>

The true ip address of the scammers is protected by Cloudflare. Finding the ip address of servers behind Cloudflare is an eternal challenge for attackers.

<https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/> seems to be extremely comprehensive and up to date. I tried every technqiue short of signing up for a service that requires an API key. No results, the following provides a fair explanation for that.

<https://imgur.com/iK54QDk>

As [/u/REALJohnBMacLemore](https://reddit.com/u/REALJohnBMacLemore) previously noted, the website was only created a few months ago. Thats always suspicious. What about the domain listed as the support email address?

<https://imgur.com/4xC20qD>

This domain is hosted by Alibaba US. That they dont even provide an abuse contact speaks volumes.

In my brief enumeration efforts, I visisted /index.php, which redirected me to /Pc/Index/index.html.

<https://imgur.com/DDUUiAQ>

The HTML does not render properly, but this is completely different than what we were dealing with before.

<https://imgur.com/wk227MG>

At the bottom of the page we see another support email address. The highlighted text seems to show that the listed website(NOTE: not the scam domain in question) might have been a real company at some point? The registration number certainly does not comply with the new Chinese business registration numbering system, which was in full effect by 2018.

Lets use <https://whois.domaintools.com> again to find some information about this newly discovered forex exchange domain.

<https://imgur.com/2o6PP1v>

The domain name has been used for at least 16 years.

This scam seems to be masquerading as a possibly real, but defunct Chinese forex exchange. Also doubling as a crypto exchange, depending on their target.

[Attribution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/cyber-attribution-essential-component-of-incident-response-or-optional-extra/) has always been a touchy subject in the realm of cyber security, with that type of debate usually reserved for large-scale nation state attacks.

When we consider the prevalent usage of the Simplified Chinese language, a Chinese PHP framework, and Alibaba hosting, Im confident in declaring this a campaign of Chinese origin. Of course, given the lack of sophistication on the part of the scammers, and the lack of geopolitical implications, this is virtually meaningless.

Stay safe, RTPP

<summary>Community: u/DoubtStarsAreFire shares her and Logris's back story</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10n7qyq/daily_general_discussion_january_28_2023/j67f4fp/)

For those of you that are regular readers of Logris’ work and do not know, Logris and I (DoubtStarsAreFire) run *Tokenomics Explained* together. We are partners in all things. Family, life, the website, and now our consulting business. In the beginning, I would minimize, qualify, and categorize all of the work that we have put into our site as, “oh we run a blog”. Probably because when we started *Tokenomics Explained* we didn’t have a plan. Increasingly, we do, or at least ambition.

# EV Mavericks Podcast:

Listen to the [Layer Zero Podcast #4](https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/VX3ZGDe6Qwb) from the EV Mavericks to hear us talk more about *Tokenomics Explained*, Hodlercon, the Double Logris and our plans for Logris Vaults! Ping us if you'd like to join our BUIDL team at EthDenver.

I felt like we could do a better job explaining the genesis of the blog. Because if you listen we kind of stumble over the answer.

Why am I posting now? The blog has mainly been a space for Logris’ writing. The main reason that I’m posting is I joined the Bankless Academy writers guild. I’ll be posting content on the website for the next four weeks. I'm calling these contributions Stargazing. There were other options for locations to post my thoughts like Mirror or Medium. I really did think about posting there. But, our blog seemed like the best place. Stargazing will be my additions to “Logris the Blog”.

Visit [https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/) to see the whole post.

*Below is a short excerpt.*

# The Backstory

I’ve always heard it said, “write what you know” so for a first topic answering the question “How did Tokenomics Explained start?” seems appropriate. Logris and I have been asked this exact question several times in interviews or by friends. That is usually a good sign you should write something down.

First, at heart my husband is a writer. When I met him, it wasn’t something I knew about him. I just thought he was a cute programmer boy that I was meeting to play board games. It’s taken years for me to come to the realization that he is a writer as well a programmer. I’m starting here because it gets to the heart of why we began this venture. He became interested in crypto because it combined his interests of computer science, game theory, and economics. Just like you should write about what you know, you should invest in what you know. Back in 2017, most of the social media about crypto was on reddit. This eventually led him to ethtrader and from there to ethfinance. Me, I was along for the ride. He would talk at me about crypto and I would blink at him and say, “those were words”.

I watched him ride the bull market of 2017 and then the crash. He survived the crypto winter. Eventually the food coin craze hit. All the while, Logris was riding the waves and I was following along or lurking in reddit parlance. Based on my experience and observations in my own house, I thought everyone was spending hours reading, researching, and writing their posts. Over the years, I have learned differently. Thank you reddit shit posters for disabusing me of this notion.

So why did we choose to make a website? In short, it’s Google’s fault. Ever since Logris started investing in crypto in 2017, he was a daily visitor and poster to the subreddit. As you know, all the fun in ethfinance takes place in the Daily Discussion Thread. Over the years Logris had made some stellar posts… in the daily. But, Google doesn’t index the daily. Top level posts are often reserved for announcements from protocols, highly regarded posts from the daily, or noobs that don’t know any better.

Why is this important to the story?

TLDR: It’s all because of Google’s SEO.

>**For example:** At some point in the past, you may have googled about a question you had. In the search results, there may have been a reddit post with the same question. You'd click the link and find yourself directed to a subreddit about the topic, where knowledgeable people may have already responded to your exact or similar question.

**Since most of the posts on ethfinance happen in the daily thread and not at the top level** (as in the example), **this content is invisible to Google.**

Logris was amassing a treasure trove of content and often wanted to cite it when it became relevant again. This became more pertinent when he came up with the idea for the Double Logris. People started asking about it and wanting to read more about it. His ideas, content, and discussions were disappearing into the ether as it were. So, he started using Google drive to keep track for referral, which was ridiculous. To save time and just generally make the world a better place we decided to create a repository for his writings by making this site.

<summary>Analysis: u/Defacticool just finished studying law and discusses how DAOs fit in existing legal framework</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10o0h5d/daily_general_discussion_january_29_2023/j6dqs2n/)

Hope this is an acceptable place to ask some questions both for the mods and regulars here. 

Last spring I graduated from law school (here in sweden, my degree is an analogue to an LMM) and I wrote my "final paper" on DAO and defi, from a company law and securities law perspective. 

I recently saw and read that paper from /u/Pbrody (hope that's correct) and EY about how the "best" firm classification for DAO's are as Co-operatives. 

And so I thought maybe there would be some interest to see my own research that I spent 6 months on. (Tldr of my conclusion: "Proper" DAOs don't fit any current, swedish, firm classifications and are unable to fit in one even if they wanted to, and securities law is unable to in any way sanction or interactive with fully autonomous swapping protocols such as Uniswap)

So my questions are: 

- Would there be any interest if I posted my paper here? 
- would the mods be alright with me posting it here?
- and finally, does anyone know of a good and accessible site where I could upload my paper and those interested could read/download it? Preferably one where I don't have to dox myself. 

Cheers! I Love this community.

Edit: Thought I should add, I wrote it in english.

Editwo: Just posted it in today's daily: <https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10oudh1/daily_general_discussion_january_30_2023/j6iwia0/>

In yesterday's daily I asked about interest for sharing my "final exam paper" from when I graduated law school last year. (After looking into it further, I believe the american term for it is something like "masters research paper") 

I got way greater of a response than I anticipated so I'll be sharing it with you in this comment! I hope a mediafire link is allowed. 

Just some heads up that the version I'm linking you isn't the final handed-in version but the penultimate version so there will be some grammatical and spelling errors but nothing that should affect the content. This is so I don't run afoul of any academic policies about sharing examinated material through the wrong channels. (Should be fine, but don't wanna risk it) 

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/tyd530ryrjljst2/DAO_and_DEFI_legal_analysis.pdf/file>

If anyone has any constructive thoughts I genuinely would love to hear them! 

In a comment in response to this one I'll be posting the "Final Remarks" portion, for those that just wants my final take and don't care to trudge through the rest.

<summary>Random: u/LogrisTheBard discusses the crypto education gap</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2023/j6ly502/)

So my wife is working on a post this week on web3 education. On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It's a lot of replicated effort and unless it's paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it's having no impact. On the other end there's highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like /u/liberosist writes. These are written for the *dozens* of us living at the edge of the frontier. In the middle is a desert of content. Once you get past that entry level content you get chucked into places like /r/cryptocurrency and good luck to you. You're excited by the potential of what you learnt in the entry level content but you're not yet proficient enough to spot the scams. Everyone is passionately shilling you something and telling you why it's the next great thing that's going to kill Ethereum etc. Basically, you're someone else's exit liquidity.

It takes a full market cycle to wisen up. By the time you transition from tourist to settler you've probably lost 90% of your investment into altcoins. Many don't stick around after that and those who leave form a moat of resentment in front of the Rabbit Hole. The abrupt cliff of learning material once you have a Metamask wallet loaded with some ETH is doing a disservice to our space. It's suddenly a space with no map and no Sherpa and you weren't taught spelunking. It's ultimately discouraging people from joining this space and slowing down the adoption of one of the most promising technologies humanity has ever produced.

In the last year I've written a bit more for this entry +1 skill level and a bit less on the frontier but anything I write tends to come off more as entry +3 regardless of my intent or else I don't find it interesting enough to write. My wife is better than me in this regard so I hope web3 does find a space for her to be an educator here. Anything else is a disservice to *humanity*.

<summary>Random: u/Liberosist is cautious not to get overly bullish about long-term ETH issuance trends</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10qm414/daily_general_discussion_february_1_2023/j6r7sq6/)

As [u/15kisFUD](https://reddit.com/u/15kisFUD) [pointed out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6m5xo7/), the sentiment currently is neutral-ish, so it's a good time to talk about things that everyone will laugh at in bull times or be depressed over in bear times. Now, both u/No_Fix_1183 and I got a ton of backlash (or as NoFix says, "[got crucified](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6q5foj/)") over the last couple of days for broaching the inevitability of secular bear market for emerging markets, and how they typically happen on narratives years before actual adoption - but there's at least a few people now who are still interested. No one will listen when the bull comes around, so this is our chance. So, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about a different topic.

When the ponzis spin back up and the mania happens, the ultrasoundmoney cult will be unbearably loud and you'll see all sorts of absurd projections around the burn, deflation and such. Some of you may remember I was skeptical of the numbers being thrown around in 2021 (having myself fallen for them earlier in 2020) - and even had a little debate with Justin Drake here. It may seem absurd now, but numbers like 20%-70% staking APR, 5% deflation were widely accepted, based off clearly unsustainable usage.

Instead, it would be prudent to form a base case now, and use those numbers instead in the future. The first observation you'll see that in ETH terms, total transaction fees outside of manias are [actually relatively constant](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) \- which is a big narrative violation of the up-only rhetoric you saw in 2021 and will see again in the next bull. (Yes, the mechanisms have changed since EIP-1559, but it's in the same order of magnitude) \[PS, edit: other data sources like Coin Metrics do account for EIP-1559; however, as I mentioned originally, it's in the same order of magnitude\] The $ tx fees are still going up, of course, with a larger economy and higher ETH price. But remember - burn rates, staking rates, MEV are all denominated in ETH, so it doesn't matter.

It's very likely the type of fees in 2020 (when it peaked) and 2021 will never be seen again - for the simple fact that there's orders of magnitude more blockspace available across L2s and alt-L1s - and even more coming with EIP-4844. Nevertheless, the "premium" ponzis and "luxury" status symbol type NFTs will always be on L1 - so we'll definitely see huge increases in gas prices.

Anyway, getting back to the base case, and what actual sustainable revenue looks like - as mentioned above, it has been relative constant over the years. This comes with the implication that, actually, staking rewards are going to be relatively constant - in the \~1.5%-2.5% range for priority fees + \~1% range for MEV. Meanwhile, issuance is going to reduce over time, so we can safely conclude the long-term staking rewards are going to be somewhere in the \~5% range. Coincidentally, at current staking rate, we should expect very mild deflation, but as more is staked this will revert back to mild inflation.

Now, some will argue "but there are whole new usecases that will come online". Sure, and fees will go up over time in $ times, but as 7 years of data suggests, not in ETH terms. Also, as mentioned above, there's orders of magnitude more space available on L2s going forward, who will pay relatively negligible fees to L1 post EIP-4844 as there'll be a dedicated data fee market. So why won't L1 fees collapse? Because L1 will remain the premiere execution layer - even the perfect L2 won't be quite as secure and Lindy, and the venue for high-value settlements for the foreseeable future.

Tl;dr: staking rewards are likely going to remain the \~5% APR range long term and inflation will probably tend towards being mildly positive, so when you see absurd projections based on unsustainable mania burns during the bull - remain resolute and sell your ETH to those who are aping in thinking 10%-20% yields and 2% deflation is sustainable.

My final "do it while neutral sentiment lasts" rant - I've used the phrase "markets are forward-looking" often. Based on the backlash I've received in the last few days, I sense that people misunderstand it as meaning "investors can predict the future". It's kind of the opposite - in the bull market people will price in a utopia that may be years away; likewise in a bear market people will price in the doom. We have seen this multiple times in crypto. But what we (arguably) haven't seen is a secular peak where the wider market with a majority of institutions/HNWIs will price in a mature Ethereum 5-10 years from now. It's very wrong to think ETH price is up-only until "Ethereum's vision is delivered and there is mass adoption" - markets have never worked like that, especially emerging markets. There are countless examples to look at with very few exceptions - but the most obvious and relevant one to study is, of course, the dot-com bubble. They priced in the final form of the internet way back in 2000, which took till the 2010s to actually deliver - and yes, many internet companies took 10 years to revisit their 2000 highs. Now, some will argue that Ethereum is not a company - but that doesn't matter, ETH's value is derived by market forces, and crypto markets follow the same behaviour.
