<summary>u/Gumpa-Bucky summarises US Senator Lummis's digital asset tax bill</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lrac81/daily_general_discussion_july_04_2025/n1d089l/)

Senator Lummis just introduced a [digital asset tax bill for the USA](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Lummis-Crypto-Tax-Bill.pdf).  I asked Claude to summarize its more interesting sections:

#### Small Purchase Exemption

* **What it means**: You wouldn't owe taxes on small crypto transactions for buying everyday items
* **The limits**:
   * Individual purchases under $300 are tax-free
   * Total annual gains from small purchases can't exceed $5,000
   * Doesn't apply when trading crypto for cash or other cryptocurrencies
* **Example**: Buying a $50 dinner with Bitcoin wouldn't create a taxable event

#### Crypto Lending Rules

* **What it means**: Clarifies tax treatment when you lend your cryptocurrency to others
* **How it works**: Similar to stock lending - you're treated as still owning the crypto for tax purposes
* **Covers**: Lending rewards, forks, and airdrops received while lending

#### Mining and Staking Deferrals

* **What it means**: Crypto miners and stakers can defer paying taxes until they sell
* **Current rule**: You typically owe taxes immediately when you receive newly mined crypto
* **New rule**: Taxes are deferred until you actually sell the crypto

#### Important Details

* **Sunset Date**: Most provisions expire after December 31, 2035
* **Effective Dates**: Different sections take effect at different times, mostly after 2025
* **Inflation Adjustments**: Dollar thresholds will be adjusted for inflation over time
* **Record Keeping**: Taxpayers must maintain detailed records to use these benefits

My talk from Protocol Berg about ATProto is up, it's partly the same as the Dappcon one I posted before but this one is better. There's a small Farcaster diss at the end in response to questions.

<summary>u/Hot-Sentence-4706 debates what platform Blackrock will tokenize on and u/barthib suspects that many institutions are hedging there bets but Ethereum is the common theme</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lst4lz/daily_general_discussion_july_06_2025/n1ls0ra/)

[u/Hot-Sentence-4706](https://reddit.com/u/Hot-Sentence-4706):

I may have missed something but I just saw this article about some RWA being tokenized on XRPL: <https://cointelegraph.com/news/mercado-bitcoin-tokenization-200m-rwas-xrpl>

Very nice but not interested in that‚Ä¶

What is interesting from the article is that there is mention of BlackRock pushing for the SEC to allow tokenization of stocks and bonds back in January.

I know there are some things like BUIDL but given that they are an asset manager and that BR has been pushing tokenization, they must be building out their own platform to do so so they can collect fees etc.

Anyone idea which chain they are using?  You would think an L2 would make logical sense.  That would be massive news.

[u/barthib](https://reddit.com/u/barthib):

I was suspecting it but now the trend is clear: services using blockchains will spread over several networks.

**Tokenized bonds, shares and fiats**

* Guggenheim: Ethereum, Ripple
* Mercado Bitcoin: Ripple
* Kraken: Solana
* RobinHood: Ethereum
* BlackRock's fund: Ethereum, Solana
* Stable coins: Tron, Ethereum, Plasma, Solana, ...
* Coinbase: ?
* BlackRock's exchange: ?

**In-house multipurpose transaction networks**

* (Poloniex: Tron)
* Kraken: Ethereum
* Binance : Binance Smart Chain
* Coinbase: Ethereum

_please complete the list_ üôèüèª

The future is not full Ethereum. At least not yet. We need to wait for the launch of the RWAs/exchanges of Coinbase and BlackRock to either confirm the multi-chain trend or nail Ethereum as the backbone of finance.

<summary>u/benido2030 talks about the value in intellectual honesty and u/haurog shares his experience in science and in Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ltllun/daily_general_discussion_july_07_2025/n1svec0/)

[u/benido2030](https://reddit.com/u/benido2030):

I now have close to 20 years of work experience. (Yes, I am old!) One thing that crossed my path many times is a topic, that is also very important in crypto: values. 

I am not going to bore you with all the values companies said they would value when I was working there, but I would love to share a value that I think is really important: Intellectual honesty. It's a value that you can rarely find in crypto. Imagine a VC (chain) that will talk and act against its bags, cause e.g. research shows their tech is outdated. That won't happen. 

The good thing is: ETH is not one of these chains and with the new leadership I have the feeling that there's no politics, but straight forward communication and honesty when it comes to difficult topics. Also when Max Resnick was (in my opinion) overshooting with his criticism a lot of the EF researchers and community members reacted in a very receptive way.  

I don't think the EF explicitly values intellectual honesty, but since there is a heavy bias towards research and innovation I believe the community likely values it as well, at least implicitly.

[u/haurog](https://reddit.com/u/haurog):

I just wrote a few days ago that the main reason I am still here and my ETH bags are unreasonably overweight, is because of the intellectual honesty many in the Ethereum space show. I have a science background, which means I read hundreds of papers to try and distill the useful information out of them and try to decide which are probably the next questions in my field which will bring my research field forward. That is why I have an allergy against people who are just selective in what they show or even decide on the research outcome beforehand and then handpick the data to make a compelling story. These papers sound amazing, but they are full of plot holes. Obviously, the ideas these papers offered died off within a few years, because they were just built on nothing. I encountered quite a few things like that in my career. 

Same thing for me in the crypto space. There are uncountable many bad faith actors in our space. Most of them do not even try to show you proper data, if they do, they just misrepresent it. Then you have projects which have the incentive to fake data to then try to show the data off as how successful they are. Many such projects unfortunately. Then there are those people who want to sell you their own bags. They are very well funded and write tons of 'research' reports about why this thing is the hottest new thing now. Their 'research' is full of plot holes but it sounds credible enough to spin the narrative. They have their own podcast to further reach out and convince people that their story is the one which wins out. In the end, one just becomes their exit liquidity. 

In the Ethereum space there is a pocket of people which do not do that. Don't get me wrong, the Ethereum space also has a lot of bad actors, but my impression from all the crypto spaces I have been into in the last 15 years or so it is one of the few which have that. Bitcoin had it for quite some time. I also always had a weak spot for Zcash. But the Ethereum community is pretty much the only one where I see intellectual honesty being relatively widespread today.

<summary>u/eth2353 chats about software licences in light of Vitalik's recent blog post</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lug3w9/daily_general_discussion_july_08_2025/n1yaews/)

[New blog post by Vitalik - Why I used to prefer permissive licenses and now favor copyleft](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/07/07/copyleft.html)

This was an interesting one to me since I recently had to decide on a license to use for Vero, the validator client I've been working on. In the end I decided to go with the extremely permissive MIT license, primarily in order not to hinder its adoption by other node operators.

I could still change the license to a copyleft one which I would personally prefer. I don't really want large staking companies to copy over the code and start making tweaks to it that favor them but have an overall negative impact on the rest of the network (like delaying block proposals). Since Vero's code is quite simple, those tweaks could easily be made.

Going with a copyleft license doesn't prevent this from happening, but at least it forces people to publish those changes in the open. (Yes, I'm aware enforcing this is another story)

What are your thoughts on this? Anyone with experience in this area?

<summary>u/epic_trader explains the dangerous anti-change attitude by the Bitcoin community and u/LogrisTheBard explains how to best make the case against Bitcoin due to this</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lug3w9/daily_general_discussion_july_08_2025/n1y4kxv/)

[u/epic_trader](https://reddit.com/u/epic_trader):

It's highly unlikely anyone you discuss BTC with are going to change their opinion or even acknowledge basic facts, so you're probably wasting your time. 

Bitcoin's number 1 issue which affects all other issues is that you can't upgrade Bitcoin. The community has spent the last 15 years demonizing hardforks and really any kind of alteration to Bitcoin. The community cannot come to agreement about anything. They couldn't even agree on something as mundane as how to raise the blocksize limit and that basically split the community. There's no chance they can find an amicable solution to the real existential issues like quantum computers or figuring out how to pay for security after the next 3 halvings. 

There's a threat that the earliest Bitcoin wallets can be drained by quantum computers. The only solution is that the owners must migrate the funds. Alternatively the community must block those addresses. Or you have to accept that something like 20% of all BTC potentially can be stolen and dumped on the market. It shatters the entire notion of BTC being "digital gold" if you can't assume that your Bitcoin is safely stored without your intervention. 

The security budget is 98% made up of the block reward and 2% from transaction fees. Today it's 3.125 BTC, which is essentially what it would cost to attack the network for anyone with access to the hardware. in 12 years the block reward is 0.4 BTC, in 20 years under 0.1 BTC. Where's the money to pay miners going to come from? You think users are going to pay $50-100 for a transaction? 

Technically you can solve these issues, but there's not willingness to do so. The strongest arguments for Bitcoin is that is doesn't change and that there's a 21,000,000 hard cap on issuance. So how is the community going to solve these issues without making any changes?

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

The most defensible point is the gradually looming security budget challenges. You need to understand how such an attack would be carried out and be able to elaborate how an attacker can stand to profit hundreds of billions of dollars in such an attack. Ask them how much mining profit needs to be to secure a market cap of this size. What is an appropriate multiplier between the market cap to be attacked and the cost to attack it? 

Whatever answer they give, ask them how they plan to achieve that number without inflation. The blockspace needs to be valuable and as yet blockspace demand isn't keeping up with halvenings. Outside of a brief spike from ordinals demand is trending towards zero. Do they plan to patch the network? Do they even believe a hard fork is possible and if so what would they add to a fork to fix this problem?

The trick here is all viable designs look like Ethereum. If they pitch an L2 centric design, that's Ethereum. L2s are great but why is an L2 on the Bitcoin Network better? It's worse in cost and throughput if it's using the Bitcoin Network for data availability or sequencing. If they pitch changing the 21M cap, that's Ethereum. In all cases the Bitcoin Network is a very antiquated tech stack trying to defend a huge market cap so there's just this looming question no one wants to answer of what do you do about that. Mostly just be Socratic and logically lead them one question at a time through every alternative and why they don't work until all alternatives are exhausted.

At some point they'll get very frustrated because they can't justify their own beliefs. In their confusion and frustration you can chip at the foundations of faith. You can lead them to the entrance but they have to enter the Rabbit Hole on their own.

<summary>u/HauntedJockStrap88 focuses on the decentralisation and becoming the global settlement layer</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lva9xj/daily_general_discussion_july_09_2025/n26gmna/)

Decentralization is *not* a meme. It is the entire reason crypto is a thing. I can respect the Bitcoiners even if we disagree on many things. Solana bros deserve no respect. They are ideologically bankrupt. 

There is one smart contract platform that will provide the necessary scale and decentralization to be the global settlement layer. 

Ethereum is the network that will change the world. ETH is the asset that powers that network. It is a pristine SOV. It is money for the digital age. 

Take heart, friends. The thesis will play out and we are reaching escape velocity. The pipe dreams from past cycles will return as regulation materializes and adoption intensifies. ICOs. NFTS. DeFi. Regenerative finance. Stablecoin payments. You will see these ideas return to the public consciousness as they had before but also in new, unexpected ways. 

This time is different. I‚Äôve held (and bought) through the Terra and SBF disasters. I was with you all over the past few years as interest rates spiked and regulators targeted the fine people building this network. 

This time the corpos are with us. This time the US government is with us. This time we have people like Joe Lubin and Danny Ryan in Washington and on Wall Street- not SBF. This time the network has already begun implementing its scaling roadmap- one that will scale up our throughput indefinitely while not sacrificing our values.
