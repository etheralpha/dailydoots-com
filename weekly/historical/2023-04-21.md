<summary>u/nixorokish celebrates u/Benjamin Chodroff's great work to save over 2000 compromised validators</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12kcm3z/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2023/jg5ex6s/)

Dunno if anyone's mentioned this yet, but CLWP (EIP-4736) included 2,133 potentially or definitely compromised validators who were racing to set their withdrawal address before a hacker could.

Of those 2133 in the set, 2133 were able to set their address to one controlled by the rightful owner. 100% success rate. *Not a single one* to a hacker.

Benjamin Chodroff (and Jim McDonald, I shouldn't have omitted that) was the author and did a seriously amazing job after realizing that his own seed for his validators were compromised and, instead of giving up and leaving the space, found a way to save not just his own, but thousands of others. Seriously amazing job.

<summary>u/domotheus and u/geoffbezos discuss EIP-4844/Danksharding</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzwpos/)

[u/domotheus](https://reddit.com/u/domotheus):

Imagine you go to the Apples and Oranges Store because you need some oranges. But the store owner is quirky and has a rule that goes "This store will only sell 1000 total items per day. Whether that's 1 apple and 999 oranges, or 900 apples and 100 oranges, or a perfect split I don't care. Once I sold my 1000th item I'm done for the day."

Also, this store's apples are very good. People drive from all over the place to buy them. So naturally since supply is low and demand is high, so the cost of apples go up and the store owner makes a killing selling them. Oranges, on the other hand, aren't as popular. On average, the store owner sells about 980 apples and 20 oranges every day.

You personally don't really care that much about the apples, you want to buy oranges. But due to the store's weird rule, you still have to outbid people looking to buy to buy apples. Oranges should be cheap because they are plentiful and in low demand, but every orange you buy is an apple someone else can't buy. After the store sold 999 items that day, why would he sell you an orange for $1 when someone's willing to buy an apple for $10? You'll have to offer at least $10 to get the orange you want.

"This is really dumb", you think to yourself. You talk to the store owner and make him come to his senses, and he agrees to change his stupid rule. Now he'll sell at most 1000 apples per day *and* at most 100 oranges per day. So now that the two supply/demand markets are separated, an apple can cost $10 and the orange can cost $1 and everybody's happy - you get cheap oranges, and the store owner gets more money (1000 x $10 + 200 x $1 gets him more money than the previous system when $10 was the cost of an *item* and he sold 1000)

Back in Ethereum land the apple represent *execution* (the gas that affects state, compute stuff in the EVM, etc.) and oranges represent *data* (the gas that stores stuff in the chain's history). Rollups do their execution off-chain, so what they need most from Layer 1 is data. Today the cheapest solution is using call data at 16 gas per byte. But if everyone's fighting to do EVM stuff, the cost of that 16 gas/bytes goes up as well because there's only so much gas in each block. This really shouldn't be the case, since data is a different resource from execution.

So what EIP4844 does is separate those two resources into two distinct markets: The gas market as we know it today stays the same, and there's a new "data gas" resource with its own pricing that happens separately. Rollups will be happy because now they get to commit their batches on chain in these nifty new things called "blobs", and when demand for blobs is low, blobs will be cheap ­— even if there's a huge NFT drop going on that brings gas to 500 gwei

On a technical level it does other cool things in preparation for full danksharding later on, which will allow a significant increase in the size of blobs so that it becomes even cheaper for rollups to commit data to blobs. But even without danksharding, just splitting the markets will help drastically lower fees on rollups, which will be nice.

[u/geoffbezos](https://reddit.com/u/geoffbezos):

[Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzrdc2/) I asked about how EIP 4844 aka proto-danksharding works.

I got some really good answers so decided to sum it up, I put together a [thread](https://twitter.com/0xjaypeg/status/1646550326965862400) with an ELI5 on how danksharding works. TL;DR for those that don't want to click into twitter:

- ETH txns vary across "complexity" (complexity measures gas)
- Txn "complexity" is split between "execution" vs. "data"
- Currently "execution" and "data" are sold via the same gas market
- Danksharding splits up these up so there's a "data gas" market
- "Data gas" market sells "data" via "blobs"
- L2s benefit since the txns they post to mainnet have a lot of "data" complexity 
- The implication is that L2 txn costs won't be as impacted by ETH mainnet activity (big NFT mint, airdrop claim event)

<summary>u/Ender985 shares some NFT drama that reminds us about the importance of immutability</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12lkn8x/daily_general_discussion_april_14_2023/jg7my5f/)

Meanwhile, in post-Shapella NFT-land..

The whole point of crypto is trustlessness and code-is-law. As a consequence, NFTs are immutable.

Well, it turns out that sometimes they are not.

Truth Labs, the org behind Goblintown profile picture NFTs, suddenly changed the jpegs of their all NFT collections to a.. middle finger with more middle fingers, with the text: "Fuck royalties. Fuck supporting builders and creatives. Flipping is the heart of what makes web3 special. Honor the flipper, fuck the community. Long live the slow rug!" [Check for yourselves](https://opensea.io/collection/goblintownwtf). 

This move is part of their migration to new contracts, probably to enforce royalties on-chain. As you know, the Blur vs OpenSea feud caused a race to the bottom on "off-chain" royalties.

Truth Labs still had access to the contracts able to change the metadata of their NFT collections, effectively giving them the power to change the jpeg that the NFT represents. This took many holders by surprise, since they thought their NFTs were immutable.. Well now they need to trust that Truth Labs will change their jpegs back.

There is a lesson to be learned here. Even if a web3 participant understands the underlying technology, and the principles of trustlessness and immutability on which crypto is founded, they still can be caught in a trap. Smart contracts are law, but sometimes this law is not what we think it is.

Any legal people care to give an opinion on what todays ruling means for the SEC? 

* Supreme Court Endorses Streamlined Challenges to Agency Power

<https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/us/supreme-court-administrative-state.html>

[u/Dont_Waver](https://reddit.com/u/Dont_Waver):

It means that if someone is being charged by the SEC, and that person claims that the SEC is acting unconstitutionally, that person doesn't have to wait until the SEC is done with the enforcement action to appeal in court.

Administrative groups, such as the SEC, are part of the executive branch of the government, but they have a sort of judicial power in enforcing the regulations that they were formed to enforce. So previously, you would have to wait until they were done with their investigation and enforcement action before you could appeal to a court. However, if you are arguing that the SEC doesn't have constitutional authority to enforce whatever it is they're trying to do to you, it's kind of silly to have to wait for them to finish the whole investigation and enforcement action before you can object and appeal.

For the SEC, this means that if, for example, Coinbase was charged in an enforcement action by the SEC and Coinbase wanted to argue that the SEC doesn't have the power to regulate crypto under their grant of power, it could immediately appeal to a federal or state court and have this argument ruled on. This would save a ton of time and money if the court finds that the SEC doesn't have that power.

<summary>u/interweaver has a great idea 💡</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12mqnlc/daily_general_discussion_april_15_2023/jgfzula/)

So there's this idea I've been wanting to try for a while now.

You guys know how Ethernodes is notoriously bad at showing how many actual execution nodes there are? And so we don't have any real sense of how many there might be? I even see some discussion farther down the daily today on that subject.

I think we here in EthFinance/EthStaker might be uniquely well-placed to answer that question: how many nodes *are* there on Ethereum? Basically, a bunch of us who run nodes (including execution clients) would go and look up our node by IP address or public key on ethernodes.org. Then we'd each just reply to the comment/thread/whatever with a simple "yes" or "no", depending on whether Ethernodes knew about our node.

With a big enough sample size, like dozens or ideally a few hundred+, we'd start to get a pretty clear picture of how many actual nodes there are out there.

Example: Ethernodes claims there are 7500 nodes on a particular day. When 100 of us check our nodes that day, only 25% show up on Ethernodes. Conclusion: There are actually 30k nodes, give or take some error bar that I'm sure the stats majors here could figure out (i.e. not me :P )

Thoughts?

<summary>u/BuyETHorDAI discusses an anti-crypto podcast which reminds us that the most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood.</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jghox4h/)

Anyone watch Bill Maher? One his guests wrote an anti-crypto book, and I just found the arguments in their interview funny.  I think the interview just furthers my view that Ethereum needs to dissasociate itself from the word cryptocurrency. I would much rather see the word cryptonetwork as it conveys that currency is not a central theme. But anyways I summarized the interview because I think this is a great summary of the mainstream opinion on "crypto".

- Cryptocurrencies aren't currencies and never will be (defined as store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account)
- Centralized exchanges should be regulated like banks
- If money is trust, then the term trustless money is nonsense. It's like saying a government-less government, or religion-less religion. 
- cryptocurrencies are not money, they are investments for higher returns which makes them a security
- The only people that use them are crminals and gamblers because its inherently a zero-sum game because cryptocurrencies don't do anything. Usually a security is a share of a stock, but with crypto there's no product, there's no good, or service, which is why it's a zero sum game where for someone to win, someone has to lose
- Crypto is a ponzi scheme because a million people can't access their money out of FTX
- If you lose your "pin number" in crypto, then you're just fucked and there's nothing you can do which is why people use exchanges so that someone else is reponsible for your shit
- Most centralized exchanges are fake and eventually collapse
- NFTs are a ponzi scam / right click save / jpgs / wash trading / goodluck selling your bored ape
- The amount of energy for "blockchains" is ridiculous. In 2021, Bitcoin and "other cryptocurrencies" mined a ton of energy.

These are almost verbatim the arguments thrown around. The first thing I notice is that if you replace the word cryptocurrency with Bitcoin, it makes a lot more sense. The arguments are very surface level and lack a ton of nuance because in the maintreams eyes, cryptocurrencies are all like Bitcoin. I think the old saying around here absolutely applies. The most bullish thing about Ethereum is to be understood.

<summary>u/wolfparking covers the large institutions moving in to the space</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jgjy13h/)

Now that withdrawals are enabled with the successful upgrade of Shapella, I'm keeping an eye out for institutions and big movers. 

Already this year we've seen [Fidelity and Blackrock](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/21/14-trillion-earthquake-fidelity-and-blackrock-are-quietly-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-next-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-bull-run/?sh=41e77f2a6759) pouring funds into Blockchain. 

NASDAQ in their [Digital Assets Business is expected](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-eyeing-q2-2023-release-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-custody-platform) to start providing customer crypto custody by the end of June after receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. Much like Fidelity, the platform will function similar to an exchange with liquidity and execution services. 

Just last year [Bank of America reported](https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2022/10/bank-of-america-private-bank-study-finds-younger-investors-turni.html) a turning signal for wealthy investors away from the stock market and into Crypto, Real Estate, and Private Equity.

>"75% of young investors say it’s impossible to achieve above-average returns solely with traditional stocks and bonds."

Combine this sentiment with the economic slowdown and credit crisis, crypto investments are in better position this year.

Also, and not the news I expected to see gain traction and excitement, but the Bank of America is reporting some interesting drivers of recent digital asset adoption from gold:

[Tokenized gold](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/16/bank-of-america-reveals-surprise-crypto-key-driver-amid-300-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana-price-boom/?sh=35b657842956) passed $1 billion in value last month under the market cap pump of stablecoins PAXG and tether gold XAUT. 

> "Tokenized gold provides exposure to physical gold, 24/7 real-time settlement, no management fees and no storage or insurance costs. The low minimum investment increases accessibility and fractionalization enables the transfer of physical gold ownership and value that was not previously possible."

We could all do with some peace of mind and stability after all the black swans we've experienced last year. Here's to hoping that these large institutions don't exert regulatory and market forces in the wrong direction and fuck it up for the rest of us.

<summary>u/Jin366 digs up something from YouTube covering AI and Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12p2uhe/daily_general_discussion_april_17_2023/jglfue6/)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3DP-40TA4&t=2380s>

This is a gem of a channel. He talks about autonomous AI and how Ethereum might play an important role in the future AI economy. Really good. 

This is the part where he speaks about AI economy (and Ethereum):

"Now, I will discuss the integration of these AI models into the legacy financial system and Ethereum. These models can function as a central brain and connect to other neural networks, AI systems, and handcrafted intelligence systems like Wolfram Alpha. As the AI assistant interacts with apps and handles tasks for you, there will be a need for it to manage money.

In the first iteration, AI will interact with apps to book flights, for example, and users will confirm and approve transactions. As the AI becomes more effective and trusted, users will want it to handle more tasks autonomously, including financial transactions.

There will be pressure to integrate AI into financial systems, but this may create friction in the traditional financial system. These autonomous AI entities might face difficulties meeting regulatory expectations because the legacy system is governed by regulations designed for humans. Additionally, the traditional financial system is not well-suited for global transactions between AI agents due to regional differences.

Crypto systems like Ethereum, on the other hand, are well-suited for autonomous systems. Ethereum was designed with the idea that autonomous agents might conduct much of the financial activity in the future. It is permissionless, global, transparent, and digital-native, making it an ideal platform for AI agents to manage accounts and interact with smart contracts.

Though most economic activity still occurs in the traditional financial system, friction in that system may push AI agents towards crypto systems like Ethereum. Smart contracts on Ethereum can be used to coordinate AI agents, creating a seamless environment for AI-driven financial transactions."

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12qb6uw/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2023/jgrgc6o/)

Patrick McHenry did a FANTASTIC job with Gensler today. I believe he really forced the issue on Ethereum as a Commodity and hope it leads to regulatory movement (but maybe we in the U.S. shouldn't hold our collective breaths just yet with our painfully slow government, sigh). Anyway, g*reat job Rep McHenry!*

But damn, also McHenry (and I'll keep this REALLY brief): **votes against** Women's Health Protection, the Chips Act, the Infrustructure & Jobs Act, multiple bills protecting Queer rights, multiple bills protecting the right to vote, multiple bills to (can we please!) close assault weapon loopholes...

\*Okay, back to Ethereum. And yes I'm flying my 'Murica flag here today, so bare with us everyone around the globe :)

I've been thinking a lot about how Ethereum can be represented better in U.S. legislative process. Reps like McHenry & Emmer are (let me be mild here) faux "public servants." They have clear records of working against the Common Good. **Ethereum deserves better heroes.** I don't consider myself politically savvy and work in an unrelated field but am wondering what effective avenues would be worth my time and/or support. I have donated to Coincenter in the past and probably will again, ~~but I need to update myself on what they have been up to.~~ *Edited:* [*Coin Center works to educate policy makers.*](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) *Recent efforts to educate involved the terrible "Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act," the "RESTRICT Act," and the Treasury's DeFi risk assessment. I hope to find out more about specific advocacy they are doing.*

Any other coalitions come to mind I need to become aware of? Any ideas perculating on effective organizing or lobbying for those of us who care about good ETH regulation? I would love to donate some time and energy to this, but not sure at this juncture what will make a difference.

P.S. Just so you know I'm not on some Lib high horse, I can't stand listening to Senator Warren talk either \*facepalm. Thanks for reading...

<summary>u/RevolutionarySoil11 has some wallet tips for everyone</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12qb6uw/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2023/jgqarxi/)

For anyone worried, here are some wallet tips:

1. Keep your funds seperated if you have a lot of money. There have been plenty of cases of people accidentally signing fraudulent transactions even with a hardware wallet, because their PC was compromised. So don't mix your 100 Eth retirement money with your wallet containing dickbutt NFTs. Also if you interact with dodgy or untested contracts, use a seperate wallet for that too. 
1. For best security use a multisig wallet/social recovery or a hardware wallet
1. Wallet ≠ wallet. Do your research, the more funds you have the more careful you should choose the wallet. They're all developed by different teams with different philosophies
1. No, HW wallets are not unhackable as some seem to think. There can be and have been plenty of bugs found in the code. The same goes for any wallet. There is no perfect security, know the risks. 
1. Revoke permissions!
1. Hackers aside, another maybe even more common way ppl lose funds is by their own error. Make sure you have the keys/recovery phrase properly backed up. There are a lot of different ways you could do that, spend some time reading up on it. Never upload it to any online machine or expose it to a camera connected to the internet. No cloud storage, no smartphone etc. Your private key must never get close to the internet! Obviously physical theft can also be a concern, although lesser. There are ways to greatly mitigate the risks of self custody, look into it.
1. If you're relatively new to all of this Andreas Antonopoulos has some great videos on wallet security etc. on Youtube. He mostly talks about Bitcoin but it's same same for beginners. It's important to know the basics.

Here's a draft letter to the president/legislators/lawmakers from the perspective of a web3 developer. \*One\* sentence was generated via ChatGPT, the rest are my own words (my letter will be different, as I am not a dev tho I do feel like this effects my career too). Feel free to use and customize. Apologies but I'm super tired and barely proofread it.

> Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  
>  
> I’m writing today because I am concerned about the lack of clear regulation in the blockchain and web3 industry. For many developers in the space, this technology is our pride and livelihood. Most of us recognize that the space has an overabundance of scams and theft. There is a clear distinction between private companies like FTX who offer a product with no transparency and a public ledger built on open source technology.  
>  
>  
>  
> Blockchains offer a lot more than just being an immutable ledger. Web3 has the potential to transform many aspects of our society, including finance, governance, and data ownership. The United States should be a leader in innovation and adoption of impactful technologies. As someone who grew up in the nineties, it is the closest thing that reminds me of my childhood during the early days of the internet, when America chose to be a leader in household adoption of a technology that advanced communication beyond what we would have ever imagined a century ago.  
>  
>  
>  
> Although our industry has a lot of problems, there have been some great achievements from development teams and good faith actors in the space. Last year, ethereum had a groundbreaking upgrade that reduced network energy consumption by almost a hundred percent by upgrading to proof of stake and eliminating the need for wasteful crypto mining. Hacked funds are often traced by the community with updates on activities broadcasted through social media and it’s quite common for the community to help its users get stolen funds back. There have also been millions of dollars donated in aid to Ukraine through cryptocurrency.

Today there are many communities in web3 that make up the collective space and if you were to navigate through them you would find there are many who are excited about this technology. Many of us have put a lot of time, passion, and hard work into the development of this tech and it’s a big part of our lives.

We are also disappointed by the actions of SEC chairman Mr. Gensler and his hostility to American companies like Coinbase, who actually have gone above and beyond in regulatory compliance. Furthermore, the draft bill of the RESTRICT Act contains alarming implications for the privacy and speech of American citizens.

We especially urge regulatory clarity for developers, stakers, and everyday users. We understand that there shouldn’t be rushed legislation to integrate blockchain and crypto assets into our existing financial infrastructure. We just want to do our jobs as software developers and home stakers, who work hard and invest our time and money into developing a revolutionary technology.

<summary>u/asdafari12 reminds us that we aren't against regulation itself</summary>

Reading many ppl here the last days that claim we are just greedy and only care about pumping our bags. **We aren't against regulation, we are against bad regulation.** If the SEC got its way, I predict that ETH would be a security that retail can't touch directly, only indirectly from various bank products. Private stable coins might be banned. Private wallets, or what they call them - unhosted wallets, wild wallets or dark wallets will be banned. Defi itself likely banned unless accessed from a bank that charges a fee, "for our protection".  

No other country is stuck on the question, whether ETH is a security or commodity. Crypto regulation in the UK and EU is not perfect but we realize that crypto is here to stay and put out regulation, guidelines and not just 55 litigations. I was positively surprised by how many Defi actions, my Nordic tax authority has provided guidelines on this year. ETH staking (cap. gains, not ordinary income), lending, LPing etc. Meanwhile, the US IRS hasn't even spoken about ETH staking. Most people will likely class it as ordinary income because that is safer than to classify as the lower taxed capital gains. 

SEC's actions are embarrassing (even Hester, Gensler's colleague says so), the IRS is embarrassing, the political dick swinging between agencies, embarrassing. R vs D as well and things like that make me lose faith in society and the democratic process more than any crypto scammer ever did. Scammers do it for the money, above, I think is done for the same or even worse reasons.
