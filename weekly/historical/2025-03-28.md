If a blockchain is not truly decentralized, the owners\* should be held accountable to the fullest extent for what happens on it. It cannot be the case that if certain actions are prohibited on your own server, you can simply spin up two AWS instances and suddenly claim you’re allowed to do on it whatever you want because "it's decentralized!"

**Imagine how different the world would look if centralized blockchains were held liable - Most of them wouldn't even exist!**

I understand this is an oversimplification, but the more I reflect on all the rug pulls, scams etc. in the space, the more I think Gary G. had some valid points (though I won’t defend his terrible actions over the years).

\*owners = the entities which are in effective control of a blockchain

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jga3s3/daily_general_discussion_march_21_2025/miyroiy/)

Hey ethbros and ethgals,

A few weeks ago, I asked in the daily whether it was worth it building a Decentralized Exchange as a solo developer or it was a waste of time.  
Many of you encouraged me to stop overthinking and just start building, so I did.   
Today, I'm happy (and seriously nervous) to share that I've completed the early version of my non-custodial DEX & liquidity pools aggregator.

🔗 [ChainBridge Trading](https://www.chainbridge.trading/)

This is very much an MVP with a long roadmap ahead and I'd really really appreciate your honest (harsh?) feedback if you have a moment to check it out or even try a small trade or two.

my AMA section:

# Why I Built This?

I've been following DeFi for years and wanted to contribute something useful. Building a DEX seemed like the right challenge—complex enough to be interesting but still manageable for one person with the right background.

# My Journey So Far?

* Started with a basic swap application proof-of-concept
* Hit a wall with liquidity pool creation, so pivoted to aggregating existing liquidity sources
* Integrated with 0x protocol for better routing
* Added support for multiple networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon)
* Implemented security best practices
* Made the UI functional (though it's still quite simple)

# What I'm Proud Of?

* Supporting 100+ trading pairs across 5 networks
* Implementing routing logic that often finds better paths than other aggregators
* Building something reliable enough for daily use
* Shipping this as a solo dev and learning a ton along the way

I still have much to improve, and that's where I need your help.   
What would make this something you'd actually use? Any suggestions for improvements or features you'd like to see?

If you could spare a few minutes to try it out with a small trade, I'd be incredibly grateful for your insights.

<summary>u/spupul6 rejects the Bitcoin as digital gold narrative and sparks some great conversations in response</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jga3s3/daily_general_discussion_march_21_2025/miz0ed1/)

Bitcoiners biggest feat is that they psyopsed everyone into accepting bitcoin as store of value and Digital gold. Makes me mad that there is zero pushback on this front. I don't think this is a tag that you can just slap onto an asset, you have to earn it by being timeless. Gold has its status because it was valuable tousands of years ago and its still valuable now, so you get a pretty good estimate that even if you take several lifetimes it will be still valuable. Unlike bitcoin, gold doesnt have a security budget issue, you can still trade it even if there is no more gold left in earth crust and no one is mining it. It also does not have a stubborn community resisting any change, while, on top of the security issue, there is the looming threat of the acceleration of quantum computing.  This is not meant to be a pro Gold comment, I believe that a digital form of store of value has a lof of benefits, but this game is far from over. Ultimately that asset will win that can stand the test of time and \~16 years is nothing in this front.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jh1wuk/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2025/mj4eqdx/)

Last night a thousand keys each of hoodi testnet validators were sent out to the same small group of rocketpool holesky operators that I have been involved with for over the last couple of years. Just about everyone threw up their hand to volunteer for another 3+ year commitment to run hardware and donate their time and bandwidth when the opportunity presented. Proud to be associated with them.

As of now, mine are chooching (self-five!), and roughly a third of the other operators have signaled theirs are up as well. I've said it before but I'll say it again...it really is fun to be involved in the space, and If I do say so myself...it feels good to be contributing to the growth and development of ethereum in this small way. It certainly lessens the sting of the relentless negative sentiment.

Holesky is gonna be kept up for several more months. It's back to working just fine, except for testing validator exits...cuz the queue is like a year long.

<summary>u/RandomZileanMain believes that the biggest debt crisis in history is coming and u/LogrisTheBard weighs in</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jhsodu/daily_general_discussion_march_23_2025/mjdf90z/)

[u/RandomZileanMain](https://reddit.com/u/RandomZileanMain):

More than ever, I’m convinced: one of the biggest debt crises in history is coming. 

The U.S. economy is more leveraged than ever. Federal debt has surged past $35.8T, 120% of GDP, double 2008 levels and 4x the 1970s. Interest payments are nearing $478B/year, 16% of the budget, and rising.

Household debt is over $18T: $12.6T in mortgages, $1.21T in credit cards, $1.66T in auto loans, $1.62T in student debt. Consumer credit is rising as interest burdens grow. Corporate debt is also ballooning, $13.8T or 46% of GDP, the highest ever. Much was locked in at low rates but now needs refinancing at far higher cost.

Liquidity trends tell the rest: M2 money supply exploded during 2020–21 (+26.9% YoY), then reversed hard. QT kicked in. Rates soared past 5%. The Fed’s balance sheet dropped from $9T to $6.76T. Now QT is being tapered, runoff cut from $25B to $5B/month. 

Why? Bank reserves fall, reverse repo dries up, Treasury auctions wobble, foreign demand fades. China holds the least Treasuries since 2009. Fitch even cut the U.S. credit rating.

Meanwhile, stagflation creeps in. Growth slows, core inflation sticks at 4–5%, the labor force shrinks (100M Americans out), participation stuck at \~62.5%. It’s not a healthy economy.

And gold? Up 40% in a year, past $3K/oz. Central banks bought 1,000+ tons in 2023. This to me is a a signal: a hedge against fiat risk and broken trust in the system.

It may seem like dark times in sentiment but to me, this is exactly what this industry is built for. The status quo is no longer sustainable and humanity has innovated out of it - as usual. 

If we are ever to evolve into something more anti-fragile and independent from the tech sector, this is when it happens. Narrative drives price and if everything starts to fall and crypto moves up instead, immediately we are the counter cyclical lifeboat we originally started out to be. 

Otherwise our whole industry gets absorbed into the centralised traditional financial system. It seems less likely that we diverge when the going is good - why would that happen?

[u/LogrisTheBard](https://reddit.com/u/LogrisTheBard):

I think it's pretty certain *that* the US economy is going to implode. There is a matter of speculating on the timing but the outcome here is inevitable. In addition to everything you mentioned there's also the pension crisis. But what do you *do* with that information? Do you rush to hard assets like commodities? Do you buy the best PE stock you can and get out of growth sectors? Do you invest overseas and hope that their markets do better? Do you invest in a bunker and bullets?

Crypto so far behaves like a tech stock not an anti-fragile investment. A serious depression could drag us back to $100 ETH. We've never seen an event like the collapse of the dollar in our lifetime and ETH will have to find a buyer for every seller exiting the market. If that buyer isn't the burn, who is it? ETFs? They'll run for the exits like everyone else when things truly get scary in the world. You don't need much ETH for gas so unless you're planning to find over a billion people willing to hold 0.1 ETH for gas, that's not it either. In 2018 all altcoins behaved like shit in a toilet that wouldn't flush - just swirling around at lower and lower valuations without finding an actual holder until we hit $80. I do not look forward to how this market behaves when there is *truly* something wrong in the world after having lived through 2018 when there wasn't. The idea that ETH is going to save humanity from dark times seems impossible to me.

What Ethereum will do is remove the friction of holding any currency or stock in the world that you want. This will prevent good people from being stuck holding bad assets once currency controls start to kick in. It might totally upend the centralized traditional financial system and bring great value to the world and still be valued at like $200 for awhile. Be prepared for all outcomes. Be liquid and adaptable to changing market conditions. This means, among other things, [don't invest more than you can afford to lose](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#dont-invest-more-than-you-can-afford-to-lose).

<summary>u/Shitshotdead comments on the centralised chain trend</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jik12h/daily_general_discussion_march_24_2025/mjg9ciy/)

Seems like the current paradigm/bubble is that everyone can just launch their L1/L2 high performant blockchain that sacrifices decentralization principles. This in part is fueled by the recent deregulation and crypto-friendliness of the new US administration.

It remains to be seen whether these chains can stand the test of time as a "blockchain". I'm always on the view that a centralized appchain (and even some stage 0 L2s) might as well just be a web2 app.

My guess is that this paradigm will continue, until a point where users of a major centralized chain get scammed of their funds. Alternatively, these L1 chains run out of funds and they start winding down operations or even print more of their own tokens to fund their operations.

My idealistic hope is that decentralization wins in the end, but we must not be complacent. I saw one user mentioning here that we should stop being such a crypto police, but i honestly disagree with that take. We need to continuously educate, and also support projects that values decentralization. As a community we need to pressure L2s, to uphold their decentralization principles. Vote with your dollar, vote with your liquidity, use chains and projects that create decentralized values instead of just value extraction.

Much appreciation to community members like u/etheraider for their efforts on twitter combatting FUD on Ethereum all the time.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard issues some warnings for anyone new looking to jump into some higher end DeFi yields</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jik12h/daily_general_discussion_march_24_2025/mjlrtf3/)

First, you shouldn't be interacting with farming contracts like Beefy without first at least having a basic understanding of the platforms they are built on.

Second, you shouldn't enter positions consisting of tokens you don't understand. Many of the Beefy positions are LPs where they are just harvesting and compounding rewards for you but that means you will get wiped out if there is an issue with *any* of the tokens in the LP. Now that's probably *fine* for like a ETH/rETH pool on base. That may not be fine for an fxUSD/fraxBP pool somewhere else.

Third, I've been doing this awhile. I have been hit by multiple hacks and even robbed by a DAO in broad daylight. The thing that has saved me more often than not has been diversified positions and sticking to platforms with teams that are willing to bail out their users. So if you want to do this split your position so you can afford to lose any single slice of it. Generally that means limiting the amount on any given L2, any given token (excluding some unavoidable things like ETH and USDC), and any given platform.

Fourth, be prepared to spend at least a little time every month reevaluating farming opportunities and shifting positions around over the years. The better yields will also often require doing ongoing research into newer protocols. Is Scroll safe? Is Pendle? Is Euler? Is MIM? Defi will pay you to learn about it but you still have to put in the effort to learn about it if you want to come out of the Rabbit Hole wearing pants.

<summary>u/superphiz has some tips for someone who is over-invested</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1jk52se/daily_general_discussion_march_26_2025/mjt70o7/)

> I'm overinvested into ETH.

I'm guessing you're mostly saying this because the price is lower than expected, and you would likely see it differently if the price were performing well right now - just my hunch.

> No leverage right now

genius. leverage will kill you financially and mentally.

> it's irresponsibly undiversified

That's a fair statement, you're evaluating your financial situation and seeing a real problem. If you're under-diversified, it's wise to diversify. It's OKAY to be cautious with your financial future. It's okay to de-risk. If you feel irresponsibly diversified, you'll sleep better and have peace of mind when you diversify your portfolio. "Never put all your eggs in one basket" is some of the best financial advice ever.

> I got a bonus from work last week and it went straight into more ETH.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it could be investing, or it could be gambling. Ask yourself what you might have done with the money if you didn't buy Ether. Did you need the money to meet basic needs for your family? Do you have other unmet financial obligations? If "yes" to these, then you're very likely to be gambling, but if you didn't NEED the money for existing obligations and you are using the purchase to make responsible plans for the future, it could be responsible EVEN if you're heavy on Ether.

> How the hell do you stop?

If there's a loud voice in your head telling you to stop, then you need to honor that. Don't silence it. You're recognizing that some part of you is seeking logic and reason while you're making decisions that you believe are irrational. If your mind is saying "how can I make myself stop doing this!?" You know that you need to stop. If you feel this way and you can't stop, then get help stopping by any means necessary. If the counter to that voice is saying "but you might get rich!" - that's definitely a gambling mentality.

> Because this feels like straight up gambling.

You said it. Believe your own words. It's time for you to stop. Give your purse strings to someone else, lock yourself out of your accounts, talk to a therapist, do what you need to do to get balance back.

---

There's nothing inherently wrong with being over invested in Ether. I am, and I've ridden waves from the top to the bottom (and back to the top). Yes, I wish the price was higher, but I'm not experiencing any mental anguish right now, I'm just learning and building while I wait for the world to figure out what I believe I already know [that Ether is valuable]. So, from my frame of reference it's okay to be over invested. But you're saying that you want to stop and you feel like you're gambling - that's a huge red flag that you ARE gambling and that you need to get help to stop gambling and diversify your portfolio into something that makes sense to you. While you're waiting for the gamble to pay off your body is experiencing stress that's taking years off of your life, and there's a fair chance it's having a negative impact on the other people in your life.

<https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/03/25/acdcheckpoint-001>

it's meant to be super accessible, non-technical, and mostly an overview of the last 4-5 weeks. Something I definitely want to capture is the *sentiment* of the core developers and researchers and what they think is important at that moment in time.

Would love any feedback for the next issue!!
