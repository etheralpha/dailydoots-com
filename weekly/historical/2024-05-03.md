As a marketing gimmick EL offers an F-35 fighter jet for some seemingly impossible amount of points. Rogue degen discovers a levered YT exploit - obtains required points. EL sued and forced to provide the jet -degen learns to fly it. F35 with ETH symbol appears over Ukraine - Russia requests cease fire. Jet appears again over Iran then Israel - both sides lay down arms. Same jet appears over San Francisco - solana headquarters hit by mysterious electronic warfare attack. Solana goes down for 17 days - SOL token does a 5x (it’s still in beta guys). Degen closes levered long and pockets 320 million - retires - two decades of world peace ensue.

<summary>u/benido2030 has an important warning to anyone taking on extra risk</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ccjko5/daily_general_discussion_april_25_2024/l17i846/)

Guys, I am absolutely in favor of trying out new stuff, that's perfectly fine and normal (and somehow incentivized). But please keep in mind: If you have no idea what the protocol or asset really does, you probably don't understand the risks. 

I am saying this today because of the liquidations yesterday and some questions in today's daily, but I was already very surprised some months ago when some members here deposited (rather large sums of) ETH into Eigenlayer without understanding what it does, what this deposit does (or does not) do with your ETH, timelines, etc. 

You all are obviously free to do stuff with your money, this is a permittionless industry, but I am a conservative boomer that cares for you. I don't want you to lose money, because you fucked around and found out. You can lose money, we probably all do from time to time. But don't risk too much of your stack in protocols and assets you don't understand, for unclear upsides. 

In a bull market you literally have one goal: Keep your ETH. The problem in a bull market. They all want your ETH. If you part with it, do so after spending some time really understanding what you're doing and getting yourself into. 

Boomer Bearnido out.

<summary>u/haurog shares a big disappointment</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cdcy19/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2024/l1bzi7o/)

Let me ramble about my biggest disappointment from the last year which is Eigenlayer.

When I first heard about it, the concept was a bit difficult to grasp. Once I started grokking it my mind was blown. Decentralized trust, where validators can start to run various services along their nodes and they can make truth statements about the world. It would lead to a world where we would be getting independent of centralized truth brokers. Projects could easily and trustlessly tap into the decentralized Ethereum network and start, for example, a decentralized oracle without having to kick start such a network on their own. It could even encourage the decentralization of the Ethereum network by giving small home stakers a better revenue than centralized operators as decentralization would have a value. Rainbows and unicorns everywhere. Obviously, I filled some of the gaps in my understanding and Eigenlayers very minimal docs with the best possible outcome.

Last autumn when I first saw the requirements for running the first AVS which is EigenDA, I realized that is not something just any node operator will be able to run on their node. Their delegated stake requirements made the problem even worse such that only a selected few operators will be able to run the EigenDA AVS.

Now, with EigenDA mainnet release, we have a few powerful entities like etherfi and other LRT providers which are the king makers in the protocol apparently having bilateral agreements with AVSs to make sure they can get the most profitable deals. The AVS operators have pretty much nothing at stake. If they loose money, they loose the money of the restakers, and meat space legal agreements will be the only thing keeping them in compliance. Not sure this is enough to be honest. All in all it is not much better than if projects outsource running their services to a service provider which will run stuff on a data center somewhere. The restaked assets were historically meant to be ETH on the beacon chain, which would directly map operators to their stake. Now, a large part is just 'restaked' LSTs and as far as I understand it soon could be any token. This is a far cry from the original vision. Not sure if it is good enough to even be long term profitable for restakers considering the nothing at stake risk for AVS operators.

EDIT: I love all the different takes and nuances. Thank you.

[u/Fast_Contract](https://reddit.com/u/Fast_Contract):

"Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said Thursday that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that allow holders to “stake” their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security. Known as the Howey test, it examines whether investors expect to earn a return from the work of third parties."

I wouldn't say eth fits into that since you don't gain anything from just holding it in a wallet, but Reth and steth certainly do.

[u/Set1Less](https://reddit.com/u/Set1Less):

I think that a court if presented with the right facts, will find that a pure proof of stake consensus mechanism like ETH 2.0 does not infact satisfy the howey test, because there is no demonstrable common enterprise that is built into the protocol. Solo stakers who earn rewards from staking do so, not because another party does the work and they earn their share from others work, but because they put in the effort themselves and whatever rewards they earn are the results of their own work

I remain pretty confident that if this matter goes before a court, the court will have no option but to rule that proof of stake consensus mechanism by itself does not violate howey's rule. 

If it comes to other staking mechanisms like delegated proof of stake or liquid staking, then there could be various entities playing the common enterprise role. But in a pure pos mechanism, there is none. The rewards are baked into the network - like new issuances to fund the staker rewards, sync committee rewards etc. 

If SEC were to make this claim in a court, I would be ultra bullish on a highly likely defeat for the SEC. Crypto companies arent exactly fucking around either, both Coinbase and Consensys have got the best law firm in USA to represent them, the calibre of lawyers is 2 or 3 leagues better than the muppets at SEC

New Etherscan feature launched called Cards, in a special section. One shows unclaimed airdrops. It seems to be a cooperation with Bankless. I found it still listed STRK despite me already claiming and it didn't give the ETHFI airdrop so it might not be 100%, but still pretty nice. Especially if you have multiple wallets, you can check them easily.

It also shows blockchain messages and token approvals - pretty nifty. Anyone can apply to Etherscan in a form with their project and they might consider it as a card, if it's useful enough.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ce6bam/daily_general_discussion_april_27_2024/l1j4tzk/)

Tornado Cash case. Government's response to motion to dismiss

<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf>

The gov is basically arguing that smart contracts are money transmitter businesses and should KYC users and run a BSA program.

This is real bad. If this sticks ( most likely does unless the judge specifically over rules these arguments) it means DOJ can go after any company or person that created a wallet or a dapp (smart contract) or any crypto product claiming they are unregistered money transmitters - irrespective of the fact that the wallet or smart contract doesnt allow them to control customer funds

It opens up the potential for a 6 AM FBI Open the door and arrest for anyone working in crypto

[u/pa7x1](https://reddit.com/u/pa7x1):

I went over it quickly but I have a hard time to take them seriously when there are obviously in bad faith arguments. Let me pick the one that most quickly jumped to me while I was scrolling through.

At some point they make this argument:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*28WThvi_V_FX36kOhsKRvg.png)

And they go on a long tirade to argue against it as provably false. But the complete opposite is true. It's a provably true argument. After EIP-1559, transacting on Ethereum necessitates ETH, this is completely unavoidable. The argument Consensys is using basically boils down to, to use the Ethereum network ETH is necessary. Going after ETH, kills the possibility to use the network. And this is true, even if you assume all the fancy goodies of account abstraction. Someone needs to pocket the ETH to transact on Ethereum, either the end-user or the wallet provider with account abstraction. Now let's look at the arguments:

> Can I install a fresh instance of MetaMask in my browser or as an app & generate a fresh Ethereum address with no ETH? ✅

Not a transaction settlement.

> Can I go to EthCC or wherever & get a cool POAP dropped to this Ethereum address with no ETH? ✅

LOL, not a user transaction settlement. But someone is paying for that use of the network. If they kill ETH through regulatory maneuvers I can assure you, you will not be getting a POAP or anything in the US.

> Can I login, check-in, connect to cool blockchain dapps, sites, friends, and spaces with my ETHless EOA that has my new POAPs on it, to maybe get more POAPs, or just to browse, or whatever? ✅

Not transactions on the network. And the POAP argument was just covered.

>Can I sign messages & authorizations & authentications with my ETHless EOA? ✅

Not transactions on the network.

> Heck, can I sign contracts with my ETHless EOA? ✅

I start to see a pattern here. 100 ways to say I can still sign stuff with my public key. Everything except actually using the network which is the argument Consensys was making.

>Can I be served with legal process to my ETHless EOA? ✅

?

>Do at least some of these interactions constitute “transactions on the blockchain”? ✅

Absolutely not. They are not transactions on the network. To transact on the network you must spend ETH, this is unavoidable after EIP-1559. EIP-1559 is what made ETH a commodity in the most literal sense. Is the commodity you consume to settle computation on a global settlement layer. Signing something with a public key is not using the Ethereum network. It's not propagated nor settled on the network.

> Do people do things like this onchain 🦊 and irl, even without ETH? ✅

?

> Is this legally significant? ✅✅✅

Dunno if it's legally significant but it is factually wrong.

EDIT: And to clarify why I think this article is written in bad faith. Whoever wrote it understands well enough the technology to very meticulously choose a niche use case of your public key (i.e. you can use it to sign messages) and conflate that with transacting on the network which is not. There is a lot of intent in whoever built this argument to confuse things, they are arguing for US-based users to not be able to use the Ethereum network, period. And they are willing to twist reality to get there.

It's so frustrating seeing the marketing push happening right now with influencers on Twitter acting like Eigen Layer's token is some amazing breakthrough.

They act like it's some amazing new revelation that EL will have it's own protocol rules and not affect Ethereum consensus. Like no shit, why would it have any bearing at all on Ethereum. And this is coming from people that I know are definitely smart enough to understand this, all using the same language, so the only reasonable conclusion is they're getting paid to push this narrative.

When you have enough money you can create your own reality b/c there'll always be people willing to bend their morals for payment.

I'm slowly giving up on meaningful things coming from the space beyond what has already been or is being built. Most things from this point onwards feel like they're increasingly more disconnected from the core values of this space. Instead it's VCs building yet another level of financial engineering just because they can. So aside from some less hype-y DePIN projects, a small selection of aligned L2s, teams working on FHE and other core values related projects, I'm getting pretty over this all. I look forward to the day where I can cash out at my target price and just perpetually stake my only validator node to do my part in keeping the decentralised vision alive.

<summary>u/austonst digs into the EigenLayer token whitepaper</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cgkmut/daily_general_discussion_april_30_2024/l1wf60r/)

I actually never put funds into any sort of EigenLayer restaking; while I was always interested in the concept, the points system and insane levels of hype for an unreleased protocol triggered some circuit breakers in my brain and I just couldn't let myself participate materially. So congrats to those with access to a good amount of EIGEN, and my condolences to those who feel rugged by the distribution parameters and/or geographical/IP blocking.

The more interesting topic for me is the release of the [EIGEN token whitepaper](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf). The authors present EIGEN as having a critical role in restaking and I'd like to try to break it down a little.

# Staking Faults

Restaking provides economic security to AVSs through the threat of slashing deposited collateral. If you (or more specifically, your delegated operator) follow the rules, you get paid. If you break the rules, you get slashed. But under the hood, slashing rules are encoded into smart contracts, and preferably the logic isn't just "the AVS devs have complete power at any time to choose who to slash". The contracts can be smarter than that.

##### Objective Faults

The paper looks at two different categories of *faults*, the bad things that would trigger slashing. These are *objectively attributable* and *intersubjectively attributable* faults. Objective faults are the more straightforward of the two. This is where the contract can directly verify that the fault occurred. Think of double signing: the contract can easily check that yes, the same private key did sign two different conflicting messages, and therefore committed a fault. Fraud and validity proofs can also fall under this category: someone does something malicious, someone else creates a SNARK proving it was wrong, the contract verifies it, and slashing occurs.

These are not always easy or possible to implement for an AVS, but detection and resolution of these faults is straightforward. EigenLayer with restaked ETH is perfect for this.

##### Intersubjective faults

Intersubjective faults occur when there is a generally agreed upon truth but it is not mathematically provable on-chain. The standard example is price oracles. The contract doesn't know what's happening in the real world. We can all agree that the current market price of ETH is \~$3200, but the contract has to find some way to get a price feed from a source it can trust. Maybe that would be an AVS with a decentralized group of validators casting votes about the current price. The majority vote wins, so if the validator set is sufficiently decentralized, the correct price becomes a Schelling point.

If everyone says ETH market price is $3k but I cast a vote saying it's worth $10k, despite my number being much better, I'm not following the rules of the AVS. Anyone can look at actual market data and confirm that the price was actually $3k and that I'm in the wrong. But the contract itself can't objectively confirm that $3k is correct and $10k is wrong. So it's through agreement of the validator set, and my lone *dis*agreement, that determines that I have committed an *intersubjective fault*. Other potential sources of intersubjective faults include censorship resistance/detection, data availability, and as a stepping stone in verifiable computation before proving can be fully SNARKified.

##### Tyranny of the Majority

Identifying intersubjective faults through majority votes works well... as long as the majority is honest and can all agree on the truth. There are a few ways this can break down. First is when a malicious attacker gains control of a majority of votes: they can trick the system into accepting an incorrect truth, and simultaneously slash any honest validators. Bribes make this possibility scarier. Second is when the truth itself is ambiguous, and honest voters may come to different conclusions. Maybe we're giving Ethereum an oracle price feed of another chain's native token, and that chain undergoes a contentious fork; which fork's token price do we follow?

In the end, with the intersubjective on-chain voting mechanism having broken down, the system has to fall back on *social consensus*, usually implemented through forking. If a malicious majority is saying the market price of ETH is $1, the rest of the world knows that's wrong, so we'll come to off-chain social consensus to make a fork. The old system is abandoned, and at the social layer everyone agrees to move to the new fork, which likely introduces socially-agreed-upon state changes to slash the attacker and "unslash" any honest validators caught up in the attack. A forkable oracle could also do just that to mirror a fork in the tracked token.

##### Overloading Ethereum Consensus

So what happens in the case of EigenLayer when an attacker gains majority ETH control of an AVS with intersubjectively determined slashing conditions? We have *actual honest Ethereum validators* who could end up slashed and effectively (or literally, post-Pectra) booted from the Ethereum network. The social layer could come to the rescue again, but it would mean a hard fork of *Ethereum itself* to slash the malicious actors and restore the honest ones. 

Vitalik wrote a well known blog post on this subject, referring to the issue as the [overloading of Ethereum consensus](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html). One of the greatest risks is that we get a repeat of The DAO, where disagreement on if/how the social layer should resolve an application issue caused the Ethereum chain as a whole to fork. It's not too hard to imagine a situation where a large AVS gets intersubjectively attacked, an uncomfortable number of honest validators have their ETH slashed, and we once again have to decide between allowing some harm to the health of the network, or forking on behalf of a broken application. We really don't want to find ourselves in a position where we have to seriously have that debate again, and EigenLayer needs to be careful to not enable that.

# The EIGEN Token

The paper talks about social consensus from the perspective that tokens/projects have certain social conditions agreed upon during their initial *setup phase* that determine how to resolve intersubjective faults later on. Bitcoin's community agreed on the longest chain rule for PoW consensus. Ethereum's community agreed on its fork choice rule as well, but with a stipulation that the goal would be to move to PoS, an important decision during the "setup phase" that eased the social acceptance of the transition. Rollups and national governments also follow this paradigm. EigenLayer's perspective is that allowing intersubjective restaking of ETH would be a violation of Ethereum's setup phase--citing the same Vitalik post. They argue that intersubjective restaking in general requires a very specific setup phase where the entire community engages with the token with a very specific set of expectations around its principles and intended use.

**So the answer:** Design the EIGEN token specifically for the purpose of universal intersubjective staking. Design all AVSs so that all objective faults are backed by ETH, and all intersubjective faults are covered by EIGEN. In case of a failure of the intersubjective systems that requires social intervention and forking, that will be handled through the EIGEN token's *own forking system* rather than overloading Ethereum's social consensus.

##### Two Token Model

EigenLayer actually envisions a system that contains two tokens, EIGEN and bEIGEN. I'm not going to go into full detail about the tokens and forking behavior, but I can provide an overview, specifically of their V1 design. bEIGEN (b is for "backing") is what is used internally within EigenLayer; it is what is actually staked with an operator and may be forked into different versions over time to resolve issues at the social layer. EIGEN abstracts that complexity away for the purposes of DeFi, providing a token that can be used without worrying about the forks going on behind the scenes.

[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1cgkmut/daily_general_discussion_april_30_2024/l1wf81q/)

##### bEIGEN

bEIGEN forking is pretty interesting. An intersubjective fault can still result in slashing, as usual, but each AVS must implement a system by which anyone can raise an alarm about a fault to suggest that there is a need for social consensus to resolve a dispute. If there is an issue, e.g. attacker controlling majority stake, a challenge can be raised in the form of an ERC20 contract fork of the bEIGEN token. So you end up with the old pre-forked bEIGEN1 and new post-fork bEIGEN2. bEIGEN1 holders can claim their bEIGEN2 for a limited time.

In order to raise a challenge, the challenger must burn a significant amount of bEIGEN1--this is the cost to them if their challenge turns out to be incorrect and bEIGEN1 remains canonical. The challenger must also tag a sufficient amount of bEIGEN2 tokens as malicious, these will be burned in bEIGEN2, and punish the attacker if the challenger is correct and bEIGEN2 becomes canonical. Once both tokens exist, the social layer takes over and through market price discovery, adoption of the tokens by AVSs and other protocols, etc, decides which token is correct and canonical.

Through this method, the need for a social layer to intervene in some intersubjective faults can be realized. Ideally, AVSs are designed to minimize ambiguity about which fork would be correct if you just check the real-world source of truth. So in most cases it should be obvious. But it's probably unavoidable that some will be contentious, those will be more fun to watch play out and I'll be glad Ethereum validators aren't at risk.

Technical note: the reason why bEIGEN2 redemptions are limited-time is because it needs to be shorter than the withdrawal time in order to prevent an attacker from committing a fault, withdrawing, and claiming the bEIGEN2 tokens anyway. By having `t_redeem < t_withdraw`, the attacker has no way to get around their punishment. This carries the unfortunate design issue of putting a limit on redemption time. bEIGEN holders who delay may see all their value evaporate.

##### EIGEN

The EIGEN token is designed to be insulated from all that, because imagine what a nightmare that would be for DeFi integrations. Anyone with bEIGEN can wrap it to become EIGEN. The EIGEN contract provides its own governance to follow the various forks of bEIGEN and swap its contents to reflect its view of the canonical bEIGEN token. When unwrapping, it will only ever return the bEIGENx it considers canonical, not any other others. In short, if you hold EIGEN, you are trusting its governance system to accurately follow the canonical fork and in exchange don't have to worry about the forks yourself. The obvious risk is that if governance is wrong or corrupt, you may end up holding junk.

##### V2 Tokens

The big change in their proposed V2 is that the EIGEN contracts become immutable, and so must also be forked to create a EIGENx to match each bEIGENx. This creates a sort of historical record of the fork history through the various contracts, which gives EIGENx holders the option to hold passively and later claim all the bEIGEN tokens along the fork history, while protecting them from malicious EIGEN governance.

This seems to hurt the DeFi usage of the token, as each EIGENx will remain its own tradeable token. I think only the most recent EIGENx will be used, as it's the only one that could be actively wrapped from bEIGENx, so that would mean DeFi protocols would have to add each new EIGENx as they come out. But it's still much more convenient than using bEIGEN in DeFi. At least with EIGEN there's no pressure to redeem forks immediately; with bEIGEN if you don't manage to untangle it from nested DeFi positions and redeem forks in time you're screwed.

# Conclusion and Thoughts

The big thing here is that ETH restaking will only be used as economic security for objective faults, while (b)EIGEN provides economic security for intersubjective faults. Intersubjective faults often require social consensus to resolve through a fork (e.g. The DAO) and can sometimes be contentious. So the biggest benefit of this system is that the Ethereum social consensus layer is not pressured to fork the chain in order to resolve issues with an AVS. Without this there's a really good chance that a too-big-to-fail AVS would eventually get attacked and Ethereum would face a difficult decision about whether to fork to protect the honest stakers caught up in the incident, possibly bad enough to create an Ethereum Classic 2.0.

##### What is EigenLayer Actually?

The biggest downside to me is the breakdown of EigenLayer as an ETH **RE**staking platform. Anyone can deploy a smart contract through which you can stake an ERC20 token as collateral and earn rewards for computational services while taking on slashing risk in case of misbehavior. A general marketplace for buying and selling economic security, kinda neat.

EigenLayer is particularly interesting in that it uses ETH (which is possibly the world's best collateral asset), and all of the ETH it has access to for security is also actively involved in regular ETH validator duties. For me it feels like there's a fundamental difference there. That having your AVS's economic security come from the same ETH that's securing the network feels like you're sharing in that same security, like you're tapping into a particularly valuable, established set of actors. Ethereum validators are already committed to locking up their ETH to earn rewards, if EigenLayer makes it easy to access the same set of actors, you know you're  able to easily source high quality economic security for any project that's willing to pay for it, rather than bootstrapping a validator set from scratch.

EIGEN isn't "restaking", it's just... staking. To be fair, it's a token designed to be the best universal intersubjective staking token, allows delegators to provide security to numerous shifting AVSs simultaneously, and will have tooling around it to make it easy for AVSs to adopt. So it's the basis for a nice market for economic security for anyone who wants to buy or sell it. But in my mind it loses that critical edge that ETH has.

If EigenLayer dropped ETH altogether and EIGEN were used as the sole medium of exchange for economic security in their marketplace, I feel like I'd hesitate to use it. Wouldn't you? To some extent I feel like EigenLayer gained a lot of prominence specifically because of the ETH restaking direction, and it's a bit of a light rugpull to say "now that you've gotten on board, you have to buy our token in order to use half of our system". Maybe it helps that the airdrop goes in part to ETH stakers who followed the incentives, making it easier for them to participate in both aspects? And maybe this is a necessary tradeoff to avoid overloading Ethereum consensus; there's no other way?

##### Other Thoughts

Regardless of the above, I think it's clear that EIGEN as a staking token is a riskier play for EigenLayer than ETH restaking. It means a notable increase in complexity and risk factors. The system described in the paper is in no way simple to design or implement. And this token's close integration with critical staking systems means Ethereum as a whole has more risk exposure to Eigen Labs. Should we be putting more work into protocolizing EigenLayer in the same way that we're working towards ePBS? In taking this step, EL further invite this discussion.

I have been a little frustrated with the rough state of AVSs at this point in EigenLayer's launch, and how few of them have really described what slashing is going to look like (despite them being literally live on mainnet!). This announcement does explain it somewhat: AVSs are going to have to factor EIGEN and intersubjective faults into their designs, so it would have been unfair to expect them to develop their slashing mechanisms before this was described in detail. So cool, maybe they can work on their economics now finally. But at the same time... why the heck did EigenLayer deploy to *mainnet* before this info was released? Why?

I haven't really done a deep dive on the theory of forking tokens, so I can't really analyze that too deeply. But I have always thought it's a cool idea, and enjoy reading about governance systems designed with forking as a central concept, e.g. The DAO, Nouns DAO. The paper draws comparisons to Augur's REP token but doesn't list others that really fork an application's utility token. So this may actually be pretty novel, EigenLayer is huge and their forking system is very likely to be stress tested by malicious actors. I'm very curious to see how it plays out.

And I guess that's that. The paper is 43 pages, so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad that this ended up so long. Always happy to explain more details from what I understood of the paper. And even happier to get corrections and different perspectives.

<summary>u/Set1Less sheds some light into why projects are geoblocking</summary>

One of the CT resident lawyers  did a thread on all this yesterday. I'd suggest anyone having these questions to go through that 

TLDR is that these are all legal issues. Its not that the project says lets take their money and defraud people or lets block US, that is a good idea for us.. No. 

Its all down to legal constraints, and projects trying to waddle through unclear regulations, protecting them from potential government charges. Projects tell users, infact make it very clear from the very start not to expect airdrops for the same reason - they dont want to trick people into thinking they are going to airdrop, but end up not airdropping few countries or jurisdictions because of sanctions or regulations. So they make it very clear there isnt gonna be an airdrop. If someone files a lawsuit - they can just point to the message posted 12 months ago in discord #Wen-token channel that says dont expect an airdrop. 

Similarly, the locked is also locked to make the token appear decentralized from the start. There is a belief that a locked token has less chances of being labelled a security (since it has no value), so the project is airdropping a locked token. And they will want the community to create proposals to unlock it, add value to it 

No doubt, for end users its painful - you locked $50k for 6 months only to find out you arent eligible and the whole country is blocked. At that point you are mad, and dont want to hear "legal thingies". But the bitter pill is that all of this is due to not just unclear regulations but potential regulatory actions against projects/founders. US users must consider that there is a high chance they will be ineligible for most airdrops. So either they should not farm airdrops or acquaint themselves with gud airdrop claim technology (VPNs that work) 

Of course, one will say that XYZ project 2 years ago airdropped us, and didnt do all this, you guys suck. Again the fact is that now the times have changed, regulatory environment has worsened. If you follow what is going on for the last 24 months, its kinda obvious... 

Coming to Ryan from Bankless - I really dont envy his job of trying to explain all this to a crowd of people who think they've been sold short.
