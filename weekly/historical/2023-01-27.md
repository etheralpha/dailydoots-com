<summary>Community: u/alexiskef has an ELI5 for the Ethereum KZG ceremony</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10fu4px/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2023/j4zrfmk/)

Hey friends! As you might have noticed from the many comment threads these past 2-3 days, the Ethereum Foundation has been running (since the beginning of this week and for approximately two more months) something called the [KZG Ceremony](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/). 

**MY** noob-friendly eli5 is that this super-easy-to-participate and open-to-everyone ceremony will contribute (via super-fancy-behind-the-scene math) the necessary randomness for the trust assumptions of the upcoming EIP4844, aka ProtoDanksharding.

(The official explanation is: "*This ceremony, sometimes called a "Trusted Setup", will generate a structured reference string (SRS) which is needed for the commitments to work. An SRS is secure as long as at least one participant in the ceremony successfully conceals their secret.")*

The website of the Ceremony has plenty of information on all things ceremony, however, I wanted to share with you all an 🎧🔥 [excellent podcast episode](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/478) 🔥🎧 with a conversation between Carl Beekhuizen & Trenton Van Epps from the Ethereum Foundation and the host of [Epicenter.tv](https://Epicenter.tv), Friederike Ernst.

The topics the three of them touch on, are:

* Danksharding and scaling Ethereum
* Data BLOBs and data availability
* KZG ceremony
* How trusted setups evolved
* KZG commitment requirements
* How trust is ensured
* Combining randomness
* How storing secrets is prevented
* General contribution details
* Special contributions
* Quantum vulnerability
* General EIP-4844 timeline

I certainly do not understand 99% of the math, but this conversation really helped me understand the basic ideas behind the whole process! Enjoy!

<summary>Random: u/Bob-Rossi is familiarizing themselves with Linux for the start of their staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10gp4if/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2023/j56ezbm/)

Public accountability update on my staking journey w/ u/benido2030

After an appreciated pep-talk last week, I took a few hours this week to continue to familiarize myself with Linux. Namely the terminal - found a random YouTube video to just follow along with and type through some basic commands. I think this has been helpful so far because my first attempt at all this I just jumped into a staking guide with literal zero understanding what was going on with the terminal. It was an unnecessary stressor knowing one deviation from a guide and I'm screwed.

I am hoping to get a little more familiar with Linux in general before I go further. So if anyone has ideas / videos of things that helped them when they were starting I'd love to see them. I noticed the [CoinCashew Guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node) has a lot of security best practice type things I need to familiar myself with, so may start focusing on that stuff. 

If anyone cares (and to in general share back links myself) someone here gave me this link (sorry, it was awhile ago) --- [https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) --- which was a nice starter read and this was the video I followed along with --- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA) --- which had a lot of similiar stuff but was easy to follow in video. Both super basic, but I can't stress enough how much of a newbie I am with Linux... so it was a comfy start. 

I'd also like to keep this quasi-weekly thing going, so if anyone else is trying going down their staking journey feel free to jump in.

<summary>Analysis: u/LogrisTheBard discusses NFT tickets</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10icjgc/daily_general_discussion_january_22_2023/j5fm373/)

I think the form of NFTs ripe for the next bull cycle will be different. Just as web2 innovated on web1 by adding interactivity, I think we’ll see the same occur for the next wave of NFT’s. Gone will be the hype for profile pictures and we'll transition towards NFTs with steady demand and which produce revenue streams.

I don't think the infrastructure will be there next bull market for real world asset NFTs like car or house deeds. Governments already have systems for those and even if it would reduce their costs that isn't a metric they are optimizing for. So, I'm looking at informatic use cases of the blockchain that can remain in the digital realm to the point of delivery.

Chief among these are live events or NFT ticketing. Live events occur on a regular basis and the total addressable market cap here makes the art market blush. I particularly like this use case because it serves everyone better except the existing parasitic middlemen.

Just from a technical feature perspective, NFTs provide a provenance trail. If you gate NFT transfers to KYC'd customers then the venues which switch to this system can actually know who attended their events. This is obviously useful information which is lost now and it enables entirely new pathways to engagement between performers and attendees. For example there could be exclusive ticket sale rounds to whitelisted addresses based on previous event attendance.

Additionally there are trust and corruption issues with current ticketing approaches such as corrupt release mechanisms and opaque service charge fees. At the very least having the sale logic on the blockchain can add transparency and equal access to the process. Protocols like POAP and Funfair have already demonstrated provably fair lottery mechanisms when demand outstrips supply. Alternatively more market-like initial auction systems have been demonstrated by newer tokens like Gearbox which used [0xCider](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87). Blockchains are demonstrably excellent at executing a provably fair, transparent process.

As to fees, a lot of the service fee charged by Ticketmaster actually goes to [middlemen or the venue](https://thehustle.co/the-sneaky-economics-of-ticketmaster/). It's how they were able to grow to their current size: they stopped treating the attendee as the customer. There is a market opportunity here to reduce Ticketmaster's cut of the fees though. That is still substantial. Ticketmaster's revenue was [$12.3B in 2022](https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/live-nation-ticketmasters-record-earnings-come-at-the-expense-of-fans-artists-and-venue-owners/). It's a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi mullet and we're already seeing it start to happen even from Ticketmaster themselves[[1]](https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass)[[2]](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/)[[3]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/). This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.

Finally, unlike a normal ticket stub or plain digital record an NFT ticket can be associated with extra metadata (even after the event). A system like Ticketmaster could add some type of history system so you can view a collection of your previous events and event highlight reels for each but they haven't in 20 years. By contrast, this is much more normal for NFTs already. Integrate this into a digital picture frame and you can have a place on superfan's wall that cycles through highlights of the favorite games they've attended or that lets them build a digital gallery in something like Decentraland and compete with other fans.

So, there's an opportunity here to improve the status quo for venues, performers, and attendees and the only one who stands to lose is a generally reviled middleman. I don't think we'll get as much push-back from the consumers here as we'll see from Gamefi. However, stuff will need to be built.

The UX for buying tickets needs to be tailored to buying tickets. Customers need to see the layout of the venue for the seats being sold, be shown the context of the event, and be offered pathways to deeper engagement with that event’s community. All of these are UI centric changes that don’t require much contract code and are ripe for innovation. Adjacent to the chain, the NFT metadata stored on IPFS could be standardized for easier integration into navigation and viewing software.

Norton’s “Lifelock” password manager accounts hacked in credential stuffing attack.

<https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/norton-lifelock-accounts-targeted-what-to-know-and-how-to-protect-your-passwords/>

Credential stuffing is where an attacker uses usernames and passwords obtained in a previous hack to access other accounts. Phase 4 of my guide addresses this btw.

Stay safe out there!

<summary>Community: u/Syentist shares good news from the first Shanghai upgrade shadow fork</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10j5dkj/daily_general_discussion_january_23_2023/j5jstcj/)

[Mainnet shadow fork 1 finalising, according to Marius from the Geth team. 🥳](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530244302532615)

Assuming devnets run for another month, and then the two public testnets are spaced 3 weeks apart, that would put end March Shanghai. If devnets are run for two weeks and then the two public testnets each spaced two weeks apart, Shanghai date would be early March. Either way Shanghai in March seems increasingly likely (Just my own guessing, nothing official from the core devs on a date yet)

<summary>Random: u/bakindhuman is getting started on their solo staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10jyo68/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2023/j5quguk/)

I'm a long time hodler. At the moment I have most of my ETH staked with CB. With withdrawals coming soon. I figured now is a good time to explore solo staking. Since I'm not tech savvy. I feel solo staking is a little out of my comfort zone. I looked into using dapenode and rocketpool. After looking at tons of videos and guides. I decided to try the rocketpool route. I followed this guys YouTube video. 

<https://youtu.be/-o3IV3AClw8>

I was able to follow along pretty good and now I'm officially running a node on rocketpools testnet. I'm surprised it's actually working. With that said. I feel like I'm missing so much understanding of what is really happening with my node. All I know is I followed a bunch of copy and paste code into the terminal and got it to work. Did I secure my device enough? Did I set up ssh that I have no idea how to use? Is my firewall setup? What is my computer going to do when I lose power? At this moment I'm a very dangerous eth staker. There's so much I need to learn in order to trust myself with staking real eth. I wish there was some kind of staking class I could attend. I'm going to keep learning as much as I can until withdrawals are enabled. Once that happens my eth will go back to the safety of my hardware wallet until I feel 100% comfortable staking on my own. Thanks to everyone of you that help guys/gals like myself. Cheers.
