I imagine a lot of people here are interested in keeping up with staking on Ethereum but don't have a ton of time to invest.. I think we have a good system that will help you stay informed about staking in about one minute a day: We're creating one minute clips from our content and posting them as YouTube shorts and on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethStaker). I'd suggest turning on notifications for the EthStaker Twitter and checking them out when it's convenient for you to click.

Right now the clips are covering the goerli Shapella fork, tomorrow they'll include the Lodestar call that's happening today, and around April 1 they'll begin preparing everyone for the mainnet Shapella upgrade maybe with a highlight of previous major upgrade calls. 

I sincerely believe these short-form clips will take EthStaker's education reach to the next level and I hope you find value in them.

<summary>u/Syentist shares an article on the dangerous precedent by the Signature bank fiasco</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/120axdk/daily_general_discussion_march_24_2023/jdgwn51/)

Here's another one: [Barney Frank Was Right About Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-new-york-community-bancorp-flagstar-bank-crypto-barney-frank-fdic-9b825e2e). Written by *the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal*

Free-market capitalism can't work if you are afraid of the government seizing your business in the middle of the night because a secret cabal of politicians didn't like your law abiding business. And it looks like Wall Street is slowly waking up to this unprecedented authoritarian shift by the Biden administration. 

Today it was a bank serving crypto. Tomorrow it is a bank which has labour unions as it's customer base, or a bank which provides services to medical companies that include abortion services, or a company which was not ESG friendly enough, or a company which spoke too loudly and too brashly about the President. Seize em in the middle of the night and fire the leadership board and auction off the assets. Hopefully civic society makes enough noise about this and it's not too late to close the Pandora's box that Biden's staff opened.

Ive posted a bit about exploiting Large Language Models (such as GPT) before, but Im back with more. Even if you have no interest in this, I believe its important to have an understanding of how the data you input in these kinds of systems can later be used against you.

Definitely start by reading <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/jailbreaking-llm-chatgpt-sandboxes-using-linguistic-hacks>. Then proceed to <https://doublespeak.chat/> to apply these concepts.

As of my last post, there were 9 challenges. Forces Unseen more recently released this reflective post <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/llm-sandboxing-early-lessons-learned> along with 8 new challenges available at <https://doublespeak.chat>. 

For a demonstration of how language-based exploitation may be combined with traditional computer exploitation, <https://blog.luitjes.it/posts/injectgpt-most-polite-exploit-ever/> is ridiculously hilarious.

<https://protectai.com/blog/hacking-ai-system-takeover-exploit-in-mlflow> reveals a local file inclusion(LFI) which can lead to complete takeover of systems running MLFlow. This has been patched.

Trail of Bits has long been a leader in infosec research and auditing. <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/14/ai-security-safety-audit-assurance-heidy-khlaaf-odd/> 'We Need a New Way to Measure AI Security' is an interesting read.

<https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/22/codex-and-gpt4-cant-beat-humans-on-smart-contract-audits/> 'Codex (and GPT-4) can’t beat humans on smart contract audits' offers a much deeper dive into this subject.

And in case this has post not been related enough to Ethereum, by chance I just found this article <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/02/27/reusable-properties-ethereum-contracts-echidna/> 'Reusable Properties for Ethereum Contracts'.

EDIT: Just noticed that doublespeak.chat limits the # of queries you can make before having to purchase more. If anyone defeats the Count of Monte Cristo, Id love a second hint haha

<summary>u/tutamtumikia looks back at all the projects they have invested in over the past few years</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/122blya/daily_general_discussion_march_26_2023/jdrr166/)

Well, I took a good hard look at everything I had put money into in this space over the past 3 years.  When I boiled it all down almost all of it seems to fall into the category of a project run by naive people, run by scammers, or artsy crap that I enjoy but should never have spent so much money on.

Some of defi protocols I tinkered with make me feel so stupid now. 

Here's one.  Tokemak. To this day I still don't quite understand it all.  I popped into their Discord and the team is spending over a half million dollars a month on basically nothing.  $35k+ in one month on "Marketing and Community".  At what point do you just outright call projects like this total grifts?

It's not that it's the only one either. It's a landscape of just gross misbehaviour, scams, and projects run by people who have NO IDEA what they are doing.

 I am SO glad that I only played around in the Defi and NFT ecosystem with total fun money, and left my real stack staked away.  I clearly had no business sticking my nose in any of that stuff.

There are a couple decent projects out there, but I feel pretty discouraged about the entire space today. Maybe having my eth unlocked soon is a good thing :(

<summary>u/juxtanotherposition has some under the radar mainstream adoption</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/123c10y/daily_general_discussion_march_27_2023/jdwqpz8/)

Future mainstream adoption alert:

Likely for the first time ever, an (unofficial) [POAP was created](https://collectors.poap.xyz/drop/111565) for a WordCamp this last weekend at [WordCamp Phoenix 2023](https://phoenix.wordcamp.org/2023/). 

If unfamiliar, WordCamps are WordPress' event series that any group of volunteers can create anywhere in the world and get support from the non-profit WordPress Foundation. WordPress powers over 40% of *all websites on the internet*. 👀 

I was the only [blockchain-focused speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3McYfj6mwY&t=9770s) ([talk description](https://phoenix.wordcamp.org/2023/session/blockchains-and-wordpress-leveraging-decentralization-for-a-more-user-first-community-driven-and-open-web/)) and it was very well received, including by individuals higher up the food-chain and from [Wordpress.com](https://Wordpress.com) itself. The experience has helped clarify for me what lacks and can be done in this particular space, and how I can help. Much more to come from me on this soon.

P.S. the POAP wasn't finalized until the day after my talk, so don't be misled by my finalizing comments about it.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll spotted an EthFinancier in the wild spreading the good word</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/123c10y/daily_general_discussion_march_27_2023/jdv15xf/)

Wow. An r/Technology post where someone not jumping on the crypto hate bandwagon got upvoted into the thousands of upvotes! The post was about Nvidia claiming crypto has no use case. They of course say this now that Ethereum has moved to proof of stake and that’s exactly what the user said. Naturally, beneath this someone questioned what that meant. Then the top response there was a spot on comment. As soon as I read it I thought to myself “that’s gotta be an ethfinancier.” And what do you know, I look up to see [u/Atyzze](https://reddit.com/u/Atyzze) a name I recognised.

Every last one of you who are still spreading the good word in other subs get every last drop of my appreciation. It’s tough work out there…

<summary>u/pr0nh0li0 shares CoinCenter's coverage of the very alarming RESTRICT act</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je4xyl9/)

We've had a little bit of discussion here regarding the RESTRICT Act, which is the legislation drafted with the pretty explicit intent of banning TikTok if necessary. [Coincenter just put up a great post about how it's broad language is problematic](https://www.coincenter.org/the-restrict-act-creates-blanket-authority-with-few-checks-to-ban-just-about-anything-linked-to-a-foreign-adversary/). The rub:

> we are very concerned that an overbroad interpretation of those powers could be exploited in order to ban Americans from using entire classes of technologies, even when no foreign adversary has an actual proprietary interest in the technology as a whole

A big problem they highlight is that while there's already similar legislation that allows the government to block foreign transactions that are against the national interest (RESTRICT grants the powers to the Secretary of Commerce much like the IEEPA grants powers to OFAC), this law as far fewer oversite and review protections, which is particularly problematic for legislation that provides such broad authority:

> A broad and discretionary power to ban and disrupt all manner of information technologies should not be wielded without appropriate oversight and opportunity for review. The RESTRICT Act not only fails to ensure these rule of law protections, in many cases it attempts to subvert them.

This problem perhaps clearest when one observes that the IEEPA had amendments (the Berman Amendments) added that act as statutory protections for free speech, but RESTRICT has no such protections/limitations:

> Courts have found that the Berman Amendments, in effect, save the statute from potential unconstitutional applications. When plaintiffs challenge a sanctions designation that impacts speech, they can argue that OFAC exceeded its statutory power by contravening the Berman Amendments, rather than making the somewhat more difficult but also more consequential argument that IEEPA, the statute itself, contravenes the Constitution.

> In contrast, the RESTRICT Act has no such statutory limitation. Indeed it is deliberately targeted at restraining transactions related to information and information technologies.

A lot of other good stuff in there about how it could impact Crypto directly as well (e.g. that the Secretary could "argue that the entire class of all Bitcoin transactions, for example, is a class of transactions in which U.S. foreign adversaries have an interest" and should be banned), but all that is to say: call your representatives and tell them they should not support this bill.

<summary>u/austonst has the latest development in the MEV relay ecosystem</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je76vss/)

The Blockswap folks have released their [Proof of Neutrality relay](https://dapp.ponrelay.com/) on Goerli and provided [some documentation](https://docs.ponrelay.com/). I've been following their project for a while, the ideas are interesting. If it works, it's actually quite a large step forward in terms of PBS design. They claim relays cannot see the contents of blocks, there's a MEV smoothing pool built in, and (like the optimistic submissions being deployed by the [ultra sound relay](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) and elsewhere) relays don't have to perform validation before sending a block on. Builders instead post collateral to be used in case they try anything funny.

But while the ultra sound relay's system has the relay operator holding the collateral themselves, the PoN system is integrated into smart contracts with third party reporters acting as oracles to detect violations and penalize offending actors accordingly. All in all it's potentially (remains to be seen) an improvement over the current system

I don't find their documentation to be very complete (or even accurate?), and their recently-published [GitHub repos](https://github.com/pon-pbs) contains [a fork of mev-boost-relay](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-relay) without attribution to Flashbots or a proper commit history. And the actual meat of the system, centered around Restrictive Partially Blind Signatures, is [closed source](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-reporter) and undocumented so far. It's also concerning that their [proposer guide](https://docs.ponrelay.com/pon/pguide) has you input your keystore.json and enter your password (?!). They've confirmed to me that it's only used locally (not uploaded) to prove that you control the validators you're registering, but this is not the way to do it.

It's something to keep an eye on if you're following the cutting edge of MEV and block production stuff, or if you have goerli validators and want something to test. Otherwise maybe hold out for more info.

----

Side note: [MEV-Boost Community Call 2](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mev-boost-community-call-2-30-mar-2023/1465) tomorrow at 16:00 UTC. Going to be plenty of boring technical stuff about shapella readiness and optimistic relay rollouts.
