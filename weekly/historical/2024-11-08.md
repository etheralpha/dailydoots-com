<summary>Shitpost of the week: u/15kisFUD</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ggyuhz/daily_general_discussion_november_1_2024/lutrj2a/)

The French philosopher Albert Camus said there is a juxtaposition between the fundamental human need to attribute meaning to life, and the disinterested meaningless universe in response. He called this the 'absurd'. I didn't truly grasp what he meant until I became an ETH investor.

The fundamental need to attribute reason and rationality to the disinterested irrational market. Camus compared this to the myth of Sisyphus, who was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill every day, only for it to roll back just before it reaches the top. ETH in 2024 is this Sisyphus.

There are a few ways people deal with the absurd. The first one is to commit market suicide; i.e. the liquidation of all holdings, also known as capitulation. A second way is to appropriate our own meaning unto the market. You will hear stuff like "Supply shock incoming", "4 year cycle is playing out" or "Alt season is coming". Camus calls this philosophical suicide. The investor, by clasping to hope still bears a faith commitment which is akin to religion.

Camus rejects both of these strategies and instead poses that one should strive to recognize the absurdity of the market and its irrationality. This acknowledgement is painful but crucial. Instead of succumbing to despair or seeking comfort in religious or philosophical abstractions, Camus advocates for "revolt." This doesn’t mean rejecting the market but rather resisting the desire to resolve its inherent contradictions. Recognizing the absurd for what it is, brings freedom

In the end, we must imagine ETH happy

<summary>u/696_eth introduces us to another EVMaverick</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ggyuhz/daily_general_discussion_november_1_2024/luwv88o/)

[**Get to know EVMavericks #9**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbUqdicasAUdWmy?format=jpg&name=medium) - YieldDaddy aka EVM 833

**Hi, what do you go by and what is your EVMavericks #?**

Hi 696! Within the online cryptosphere I go around as [YieldDaddy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbUqlWcasAAuKrP?format=png&name=large). The name really started off as sort of a meme in 2022 when the brother and I started aping in a lot of random projects with of course random accounts. Fighting the Ethereum FUD on Twitter with that name was also pretty hilarious to me, so funny enough that is one of the biggest reasons I stuck with that account longterm. I am rocking EVM #833.


**When and how did you get into crypto?**

That should have been around the end of 2016 (already 7 years ago sheeshhh time files..). So one day, I read some random article about Kim Dotcom. It stated he was building a project with Bitcoin. Bitcoin I thought, what? That still exists? Why would that controversial billionaire do something like that? And from that moment, down the rabbit hole called Bitcoin I went. Believe it or not, I actually came into crypto for the tech and have not bought anything until only a couple of months later early 2017.

**How did you make your way into EVMavericks?**

After reading up on Bitcoin I of course stumbled upon all these other crypto that were popping up everywhere during the ICO craze in 2017. Ethereum the 'smart contract' platform, as a tech geek I was very intrigued with the platform which enabled it all, so I deepened myself again in everything I could get my hands on. Reddit with ethtrader and later on ethfinance was one of the best resources I found that I could daily hit with the latest what was going on in Ethereum. As more of a lurker myself I was initially sad that I would miss out on the EVM drop, however with some luck I got my EVM with the raffle. I would have bought an EVM no matter what!

**Happy to hear that you landed your EVM through the raffle! How has your stay been so far? any favorite memories?**

Our Discord is awesome and sometimes its even hard to keep up, however not directly something that stands out. It is just the best place I use to hangout during the bear market, so looking forward when the bull really hits. I did enjoy the most the moments around the EIPandas (themerge), sprotos and the current vibes with the memecoin mania.

**Earlier you said you came into crypto for the tech, what crypto developments excite you nowadays and how do you spend time in crypto?**

ZK tech really piques my interest, mainly because it's hard to fully grasp its potential, and that challenge is what excites me most, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I am also fascinated by topics like the based rollups and pre-confirmations in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lately, I have been just following what thought leaders in the space are tweeting and blogging on, while experimenting with some dApps and occasionally playing the memecoin dartboard.

**Any dApps that have piqued your interested in particular? and how has the memecoin casino been treating you?**

Recently, I've taken an interest in EFP and Infinex as well. EFP, in particular, seems like it has the potential to evolve into something much bigger down the road, which is exciting. The memecoin casino it’s been a ride for sure! Some wins, some losses, naturally, but thankfully a few of those wins managed to turn a small bag into a decent multiplier. Let's hope those little now worth nothing "moon bags" also get alive again during a full out bull market.

**Let's switch gears for a bit, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? what are your hobbies?**

Outside of the crypto, apart from the casual travels I’ve been getting back into a passion that is filming. It started with just picking up the camera a few weeks back, but it’s quickly brought back that excitement I used to feel capturing the world in my own way. It gives me an excuse as well to zone out of the normal daily busy life.

**Any alpha or advice that you can give us? It can be anything.**

Do not overthink it, in case 2025 is bullish (4 year cycle), take profits when you feel euphoric.

**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, yielddaddy? The stage is yours!**

Crypto lets us become sovereign individuals in the digital age, onboard and teach others whenever you can, we are winning.

You guys remember like 5 years ago just around covid where the price was in the slumps but DeFi applications were growing like crazy and soon after it all exploded?

**Devcon & Friends Update 1** ([Previous](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gdv8ez/daily_general_discussion_october_28_2024/lu5dt72/))

*Edge City Lanna Week 1*

-----

I checked in to [Edge City Lanna](https://www.edgecity.live/lanna) in Chiang Mai last Sunday, so somehow it's been nearly a whole week already! Time flies. I thought this would be a good opportunity to provide an update given that there's a very clear dividing line in my schedule: I had lots of flexibility to do various Edge City things this last week, but next week will be much more structured and technical. So it's a good time to summarize the experience so far. Whopper of a post today.

First, the *broad strokes*.

As I mentioned before, Edge City is a popup village, a descendant of sorts from Zuzalu, where a bunch of people have come to live and work in a small neighborhood in Chiang Mai for up to a month. The central themes, as listed on their website, are human organization, AI, real-world crypto, health/longevity, and hard tech. It's easy to paint over it with broad strokes to say "it's kind of Ethereum-adjacent tech and culture stuff", but I have been quite impressed with the extent to which it is really interdisciplinary.

Probably half of the people I've met have their focus outside of blockchain/web3 (often they're exploring if we can provide tools to help with their own endeavors), and it's really cool to have gathered all these different people in one place. Meeting new people and hearing the breadth of their backgrounds has been one of my favorite parts of my time here. I have also seen a number of familiar faces (some from here as well--hi!), and expect more to make it for the last week before Devcon.

[Cursive](https://www.cursive.team/) put together NFC wristbands for everyone to make it easy to share contact info, build a connection graph, and use ZK proofs to find common interests and discussion topics without just revealing each person's whole list to each other. RadicalxChange has a local currency, [Edges](https://lannaedges.radicalxchange.org/), intended to be used to pay for personal services or perishable goods specifically within Edge City. These get... a little use. Telegram, the Thai Baht, and good old fashioned "what do you do?" still remain the ultimate coordination tools.

------

*Programming*

There are only a few events that are truly Edge City first-party official. Daily communal breakfasts and lunches, big Sunday dinners, weekly project demo days, and a few others. Each week there are a number of major featured events and a few central multi-day tracks, organized somewhat independently but with a degree of Edge City sponsorship/promotion.

This last week we had talks and workshops on stablecoins and governance games. There's an ongoing multi-day "existential hope worldbuilding" series, and today there's a full-day AI x Neuro event. But generally anyone has the freedom to schedule an event, book a room in one of the shared buildings, and be just as "official" as anyone else.

As such there is a *lot* of flexibility in how you structure your day. I like to sign up for anything that sounds interesting, which means I spend most of each day in The-A-Ter, our lecture hall of sorts, and otherwise bouncing around to wherever fun and weird stuff is going on. Other people have made heavy use of the coworking space to get some building done. Others can dive into the wellness angle and focus on taking care of themselves for a while, or use Edge City as a home base to explore Chiang Mai and find others to get out with.

--------

*My Experience*

I started off with what I thought was a pretty balanced schedule. I'd eat breakfast at the hotel, do a bit of yoga or something, spend an hour or two in the coworking space, then attend talks and workshops most of the rest of the day with a communal lunch break at some point. Maybe a cold plunge and sauna in the late afternoon, followed by dinner and a quiet evening back at the hotel. There is a whole world of more lively evening events (raves out in the woods?) that I tend to skip--not really my thing.

I caught a fairly minor cold that messed with my morning routine for a few days (sleeping in more, skipping the workout), but feeling better now and need to re-establish some structure there. Currently recovering from an ankle injury that I should avoid putting high impact on, so without my go-to sport of running I have to be a little more creative, but there are plenty of options here.

Here's a sampler of the sort of events I've been going to:

* Weekly community demo days intended to showcase work that's being done here now. Mostly your usual suite of Ethereumy projects, with perhaps a focus on Edge City themes. [ZK Email](https://prove.email/) had some neat updates since I'd last checked in, one example being a side-event at Devcon that you can only get into if you provide a zk proof that you received a rejection email for a Devcon speaker application.
* Did a few days of yoga, never even tried it before. I still don't necessarily get the full picture, but it seems like a good combination of strength and flexibility exercises, with an element of just aiming for loosening up and feeling good. Less regimented than my usual workouts but I guess that's the point.
* Someone was working on a video game, wanted playtesters, and cared enough to create a scheduled time to try it out. So sure, why not.
* Attended an evening talk on consciousness and the speaker's idea of [vasocomputation](https://opentheory.net/2023/07/principles-of-vasocomputation-a-unification-of-buddhist-phenomenology-active-inference-and-physical-reflex-part-i/). I'm skeptical, but fun to get a little out there occasionally.
* Stablecoin track: Discussions around recoverability (would you opt-in to a system where a trusted admin could revert a transfer?), yield-bearing stables, vitalik advocating for decentralized stablecoins, a confidential ERC-20 standard, temporary approvals, etc. Breakout sessions after each day to discuss topics in groups of ~5.
* Learned about a method for collective evaluation of contributions to a community via pairwise comparisons. Potentially applicable to allocation of value to public goods.
* A short session where someone just wanted to talk with like-minded people about packing light for the digital nomad life. I got to show off my ~30L pack setup that holds everything I need for this month.
* An informal session to chat about different views on longevity research, trying to bridge the gap a little between the longevity focused people who think "death-ists" are ignorant, and the folks from outside the space who think the longevity people are out of touch.

------

*Conclusion*

It's probably fair to ask if Edge City is worth the costs. Long expensive plane flights, paying for lodging here, and the ticket itself (0.45 ETH for two weeks), in exchange for a hard-to-value social setting. You *can* get work done, but to what extent are all the events and people running around useful vs being a distraction from actual productive work? It does sometimes feel like at conferences there's a lot of "oh we should collaborate on something"... with an implied "when we're done here and get back to the real world", which often doesn't happen. But the right serendipitous connection in the right place at the right time could be super valuable too, and the massive breadth of people here makes it feel ripe for finding new insights. I don't have a good answer at this point.

Tomorrow begins a series of technical events that were the original reason for me to sign up for Edge City. Sequencing Week, mainly, which is a get-together of 50-60 people working on sequencing--as it pertains to the sequence of transactions in L1 and L2 blocks, who determines it, and how. Shared/based sequencing and preconfirmations are the main keywords. And before that, tomorrow is Interop Day--as it pertains to interoperability between L1 and L2 chains. I don't expect to be quite so useful at Interop Day, but if the conversation strays towards shared sequencing as a tool to improve interop, then Aestus as a neutral infrastructure provider becomes relevant again.

These events are going to require more of a time commitment, so I will have less freedom to do miscellaneous Edge City things. Hopefully this will be a good chance to really sit down and *do* something collaborative and impactful. And hopefully I can still get exposure to the broader Edge City topics at shared meals and a handful of evening events.

As usual I would be happy to explain more about certain points here. There's a lot going on and a lot of ways to think about it.

<summary>u/Dreth starts a discussion about everyone's "wow" moments with Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gigfh8/daily_general_discussion_november_3_2024/lv5ynv7/)

I wanna kickstart a fun discussion!

So far, ever since you started playing around with _blockchain_ in general. What are the top 3 things you have done, that when you did them you thought "wow that was cool". Finance related, or not.

I'll start:

1. First swapping and pooling assets on Uniswap
2. First ever taking an Aave loan to buy a gift card with the loaned assets
3. Using ENS names to designate where I want to be paid (and vice versa) while buying/selling assets to and from other users in a trust-based way (based on reviews of them posted by other users on a community-maintained telegram channel)

<summary>u/Vandelay101 has a take on the current state of web 3 gaming</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gk03k8/daily_general_discussion_november_5_2024/lvk269s/)

Web3 gaming was one sector I was looking forward to having a breakout year. It still may, but I'm now thinking it will be over a longer time horizon. It just seems like the space is maturing at a snail's pace. Seeing a AAA studio, even if it's Ubisoft (oh, how the mighty have fallen), launch their first "NFT game" and receive so much backlash is not all that surprising...

But what stands out to me is that Web3 gaming is still being wholesale branded and reported on as "NFT games". That phrase just carries a bad connotation to me, as it implies that players are already somehow burdened with collectibles and/or have to spend currency on in-game marketplace assets in order to remain competitive. Perhaps the space deserves the unflattering branding, at least for now... Game developers get greedy and, as their first foray into on-chain gaming, adopt a pay-to-play / pay-to-win model. Over time, though, creativity will shine through... We'll begin to see developers adopt models tailored specifically to Web3 gaming platforms that empower the player without creating the unnecessary friction that the old guard has made all too commonplace. 

Right now it seems like we're only in the early discovery phase of this space's potential. The big-name game developers have only dipped their toes into Web3 gaming thus far, dedicating only a small fraction of the resources as they would to a traditional AAA title launch. But they don't want to be caught with their pants down, however, in case Web3 becomes the future of gaming... So they throw a few bucks at a "NFT game" concept, build a few relations here and there with companies that can onboard them, and call it a day.

My hope is that game developers are able to navigate past NFTs serving as the focal point in the majority of Web3 game designs, and get to a point where they're exploring fresh concepts while keep the players' best interests at heart (fun, immersion, etc.). I'm starting to believe the first hit to really take the Web3 gaming sector by storm will come from a smaller indie developer who adopts a model that is unique in how it leverages the advantages of being built on a borderless, trustless, decentralized network.

Admittedly, I haven't done much research on this topic... Just throwing out some loose observations and ramblings.

<summary>u/cryptOwOcurrency checks in on Solana and u/growthepie_eth provides some important context</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gk03k8/daily_general_discussion_november_5_2024/lvjr8dd/)

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

As always, I apologize for solanaposting, especially on such an anxious day for many. But I think responses to this might help me better understand ETH.

If we look at the DefiLlama fees, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour fee revenue.

https://defillama.com/fees

Yes, I believe this doesn't include L2 revenue, but L2 revenue translates only indirectly to L1 revenue anyways. And yes, I'm aware that it's only been for a couple of days - Ethereum is still looking much stronger on the monthly/yearly.

If we take a SOL staking yield of 6% (from stakingrewards.com) and an inflation rate of 4.9% (from solanacompass.com), that means SOL staking has a real yield of 1.1% (no idea if these sources are accurate but they seem reasonable enough). I am aware that this ignores the upcoming token unlocks for VC dumping, but while the dumping could affect price, I don't believe it should affect real yield (which could be accessed then, after the dumping).

Q's:

1. Is this data accurate?

2. Is it possible that Solana could pass up ETH in monthly fee revenue, then fee revenue in general?

3. Can any old schmo forever access this risk-free yield just by staking like on Ethereum, or are there some special Solana strings attached (aside from the usual disadvantages of the Solana chain itself)?

3. Does this fee revenue comparison matter at all? What should I make of it? I feel like the most important property that ETH has over other tokens is a real staking yield (ETH's credible neutrality is up there, too).

[u/growthepie_eth](https://reddit.com/u/growthepie_eth):

1) I can only speak on Ethereum data and it looks to be correct I would add the following context:  

- Using a 7 day rolling Avg Ethereum fee revenue = $3.29M (yesterday's rolling Avg)   
- If we were to also include Layer 2s this would be $3.57M  
- Ethereum has proved it can remain secure and keep demand with lower issuance (subsidy) this shouldn't be taken for granted on other chains.   
- The Blob market is very new and is only just starting to generate revenue and this will change over time.   


2) Anything is possible Solana is subsidizing fees with higher issuance in an attempt to gain more revenue whilst also having different security assumptions on decentralization. Ethereum blobs have really taken the wind out of those sails by allowing L2s to compete and beat them on transaction costs. Ethereum has sacrificed revenue in the short term as we enter the growth stage for L2s this will enable them to grow faster without having to dramatically increase issuance - this is a long-term play. 

3) I think with Solana they use DPOS so you're delegating rather than self staking and to be a delegate you have to have super expensive hardware and bandwidth. So different risk profile but yes anyone can get access to the yield don't I know how much yield the delegate keeps?

4) I think it does matter but is far from the only thing that matters -  ETH being used as a unit of account on all these L2s and many of them charge their users in ETH all play into ETHs use and value (not financial advice)

<summary>u/haurog introduces us to Nethermind's new L2</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gkrnmn/daily_general_discussion_november_6_2024/lvplnvj/)

Nethermind just announced that they will launch a based rollup called surge:

or 

<https://xcancel.com/NethermindEth/status/1854150431448109155>

It is built on the Taiko stack, will be stage 2 at launch, uses ETH as token and they plan to have a Gigagas throughput. This is about 700 times more throughput than mainnet. They will not be able to achieve that with the current number of blobs, but I guess that is their goal in the future.

*The year is 203X, after failing to manage the deficit, the US government has defaulted on its debts by printing it away. Inflation is unsurprisingly out of control.*

Person 1: I really wish the government managed the deficit better. This inflation is insane!

Person 2: [Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos!](https://youtu.be/Q8hDsIoEFYw)

*Kodos's policies would have also lead to inflation. The US government is already past the point of no return because any politician voted in who is willing to implement the austerity required to get the budget back on track would be swiftly voted out. The game theory says it is no longer possible. Do not get left holding the fiat bag.*

<summary>u/benido2030 provides us with a ZKSync delegate update</summary>
[View on Reddit →](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gkrnmn/daily_general_discussion_november_6_2024/lvp5lma/)

So yesterday u/phimarhal tagged me to show support for [TPP1](https://forum.zknation.io/t/draft-tpp-zksync-ignite-program-the-ignite-program/168), which is the first proposal in the zksync ecosystem. Voting opened yesterday. I indeed will be voting FOR, but this is not the reason for this post. I wanna share my experience and thoughts being a first-time-delegate. 

The TPP is called "zksync Ignite Program". Their one sentence summary is

>Allocate 325,000,000 ZK tokens over nine months to deploy a program designed to establish a DeFi liquidity hub on ZKsync Era, aimed at increasing DeFi TVL and improving liquidity across all interoperable ZK Chains (”Elastic Chain”).

So it's about mining/ attracting liquidity by handing out ZK incentives in various defi protocols. The proposal is not reinventing the wheel here, it's similar to STIP/LTIP you might know from Arbitrum. 

At the same time TPPs are supposed to be different. zksync (not the delegates) presented TPPs in a way where things are supposed to be as automatic and onchain as possible. Instead of giving out grants/ incentives to protocols, TPPs are supposed to be "autonomous token allocation processes". If you are really interested in this, please see these two threads in the forum, the [TPP FAQ](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-frequently-asked-questions/141) and then this [presentation](https://forum.zknation.io/t/token-programmes-as-a-path-towards-a-true-cybernetic-governance-framework/142). 

I think the idea is beautiful, even if I still have issues to *really* understand how this is supposed to work onchain. Here comes the twist... TPP1 is not even remotely close to being automatic. The whole program is a lot of manual work. And - as we later found out - was/ is a project that the zksync team supports, I guess it was design with them and there's a lot of support for it. Despite being... the opposite of what they told us the TPPs are supposed to be. 

I found the proposal cause I follow zknation and zksync on twitter. [This](https://x.com/TheZKNation/status/1846929270133633384) is the tweet and as you can see zksync Ignite had a twitter account, created before the proposal was even published. The zksync twitter account even states the following:

>ZKsync Ignite will turn ZKsync Era into a liquidity hub for the Elastic Chain by streaming 300M ZK tokens over 9 months to DeFi users.

So it... will? Or could? 

Also the first comment in the TPP thread in the forum was created minutes after publishing it, the account posting it was created the same day, until today it has been in the forum 2 days, less than 1 minute of total reading time. But was super supportive. 

If you are still with me, I apologize, cause I am just starting and know this is already a wall of text, thank you for your patience and still reading!
