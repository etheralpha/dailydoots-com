<summary>u/cheeky-gorilla reminds us to contribute to the latest clr funding round!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14lvn8p/daily_general_discussion_june_29_2023/jpz0g5r/)

The [9th clr.fund round is open](https://clr.fund/#/projects) with a $56k matching pool for Ethereum-based public goods!

There's all sorts of cool projects in there e.g. for stakers ([Ethereum on ARM](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x3cd765379fd22fb33bf953239281b69ee2fc544adddd597f2493d8745ce0d904), [EthStaker](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x968ae0b1824bcae833efdc68a7cfa726a310a778743c159845593d853dbb6305), [Stereum](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x51d64bf9b8adcacefc7b5c64baa8fabf97046c58a13372266a0458b703860a32), [Rhino Review](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x800ad1e9beac6d65161e61de4550062d8d07a487206ce52d13197f2501df8bdd)), core protocol development ([Protocol Guild](https://clr.fund/#/recipients/0x627b701e00818efb468f0c5a708533ce145c360eedf7585c3cf592f776b16215), [ethers.js](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xc54a972fa079fcc9c53e0b4481a2c943298cb921f30b8c05c9bd878e01b936d1)), different FOSS ([LexDAO chatbot](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xfdd983e8d342aa14343c12211324f27b0732321e39c654fdf4d3f565967b65f1), [rotki](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0x8c5e1f713de7e6a18768d9ebe96c8bf897d462d14cfc75a12725fc9868e93913)) and meetups (mainly in Latin America, e.g. [Ethereum Lima](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xd8c9ba3b7c09ef6bfaf02edbba6318db28de04cf1d4bb0709b8bdf9b929f6eff)).

Remember that even a small donation matters! Clr.fund uses [quadratic funding](https://clr.fund/#/projects/0xd8c9ba3b7c09ef6bfaf02edbba6318db28de04cf1d4bb0709b8bdf9b929f6eff) to allocate funds from the matching pool to projects, meaning projects with many small donations get more from the matching pool than projects with fewer, larger donations!

18 days left to participate, gas prices are relatively low again so might be a good time to contribute! ü´∂

<summary>u/Set1Less explains Coinbase's latest move in their lawsuit with the SEC</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14lvn8p/daily_general_discussion_june_29_2023/jpyrmd2/)

Dismissal is not realistic right away, but Coinbase still makes compelling arguments. 

Mainly centered around the fact that even in 2021 confirmation hearing, Gensler says SEC doesnt have legislative authority to regulate crypto exchanges. Before SEC, even as a professor Gensler has said the same thing many times. Pre- gensler, Hinman speech is cited where SEC indicates even an ICO coin though a security at the time of issuance can eventually become decentralised and no longer a security 

Then out of nowhere in 2022, contrary to Genslers own testimony and SEC's earlier position, the SEC came up with the "come in and register" mandate, that every token is a security, and started suing various exchanges without even once engage in any rule making. All of this without any new law from Congress. Coinbase bring up Major questions Doctrine which means significant unresolved questions are not down to agency interpretation but require actual lawmaking 

There is an outside chance that the judge decides to throw SEC's case out. But even otherwise, I fully expect Coinbase to litigate this to circuit appeal and then to SCOTUS where the SEC is on a much weaker footing and Coinbase can win a lot of key battles

<summary>u/Syentist and u/pr0nh0li0 discuss US supreme court cases</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14mqtwd/daily_general_discussion_june_30_2023/jq5ngxp/)

[u/Syentist](https://reddit.com/u/Syentist):

With today's Supreme Court decision on the student loan relief plan (which, for the record, I find unfortunate, so spare me the downvotes), it's extremely likely that the SEC case against Coinbase would be dismissed if it escalated to the supreme court, under their Major Questions Doctrine 

The administrative state is being gutted by this Supreme Court, for better or for worse (depending on which side of the aisle your views are). If Gensler had any sense, he would push his party members in Congress to work with the Repubs to have *some* form of regulations passed, instead of watching the agencies' jurisidictipm eroded by the courts bit by bit. But political ambitions mask common sense, so no chance of that happening sadly.

[u/pr0nh0li0](https://reddit.com/u/pr0nh0li0):

Lotta big news out of the SCOTUS today but just want to point out something lesser noticed that was just announced that could have big implications for crypto (and a ton of other things for that matter). They announced [they would hear Jarkesy v. SEC in the fall session](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/sec-s-use-of-in-house-judges-will-get-us-supreme-court-review).

It raises a few issues, but one of the most important elements of this case is that the plaintiff alleges that his constitutional right to fair trial was violated, or as the fifth circuit put it when it opined in favor of the plaintiff:

> The SEC ‚Äúoften acts as both prosecutor and judge, and its decisions have broad
consequences for personal liberty and property‚Äù ... that "flies in the face of ‚Äúthe Constitution,‚Äù which ‚Äúconstrains the SEC‚Äôs powers by protecting individual rights and the prerogatives of the other branches of government.‚Äù

I actually have mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, I think yes, it's clear the SEC and some other agencies overreach and make some decisions outside of their purview. On the other hand, this could have HUGE implications for all federal agencies, and could make a lot of important federal organizations like the FDA, EPA and FCC pretty toothless. Not to suggest that these institutions are perfect or even particularly good by any means, I just have a fear of how things could look if we neutered them even further and relied on the courts to adjudicate every single violation. No system is perfect but the latter system would be incredibly bogged down and inefficient.

[Pretty good white paper summarizing and discussing some of the implications here](https://taftlawpr.blob.core.windows.net/taft/files/fileuploads/63b8817ea4a7a200249f89ce/White%20Paper%20Jan%202023.pdf)

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll starts a discussion about the concerning UK online safety bill</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14p9enj/daily_general_discussion_july_3_2023/jqhaob0/)

Do any Brits want to weigh in on the Online Safety Bill which is getting closer and closer to passing? There's a good outline of it here if you're out of the loop: <https://proton.me/blog/online-safety-bill>

TL;DR: 

> The Online Safety Bill is currently working its way through the UK parliament, and it‚Äôs expected to be passed into law this autumn. This wide-reaching piece of legislation would force any ‚Äúuser-to-user service‚Äù (such as TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter) or search engine that‚Äôs available online in the UK to protect all its users from illegal content and children from potentially harmful content.
> 
> Clause 110 of the Online Safety Bill would allow the UK government to require any ‚Äúuser-to-user service‚Äù to use ‚Äúaccredited technology‚Äù to identify and remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or terrorist content ‚Äúwhether communicated publicly or privately by means of the service‚Äù. 
> 
> In plain English, clause 110 would give the UK government broad powers that would allow it to require any online service available in the UK to monitor all user-generated content on its platform, including its users‚Äô private messages. 
> 
> This is a problem for end-to-end encrypted services, which can‚Äôt access their users‚Äô content. 
> 
> While UK lawmakers have stated they don‚Äôt want to ban end-to-end encryption, the only ways an end-to-end encrypted service could comply with the bill are:
> 
> - Remove its end-to-end encryption
> 
> - Weaken its end-to-end encryption
> 
> - Install client-side scanning
> 
> - Cease providing service in the UK
> 
> UPDATE March 6, 2023: Removed a reference to the Online Safety Bill applying to ‚Äúlarge‚Äù companies. In fact, it would apply to companies of all sizes, placing a large technical burden on many medium-sized and small businesses.

I find this extremely concerning. Apps like Signal and WhatsApp have pledged not to weaken their encryption for such legislation and Signal will straight up leave the UK.

Regarding my personal situation, my lovely girlfriend lives in the UK and I am finishing a degree in NZ for the next year. After that, I plan to move to live with her since she isn't really able to move to NZ in the next few years but long term is a different story. But I genuinely don't want to move to the UK if this goes in to force and it's either illegal to use encrypted messaging apps or not possible to privately communicate with Brits. I know that might seem extreme and I realise that it would be naive to assume such legislation would never come to NZ but for now that's not the case. Plus of course it seems like Apple and Google want to implement client side scanning anyway.

But for me, privacy is a hill worth dying on (well not literally but it's worth fighting hard for and moving to a quiet place in the middle of nowhere for). The way I see it, you cannot have a free democratic society without privacy. Though there may be a slight caveat for if the surveillance tools involve open source client side scanning with transparent and effective detection software but let's face it, that's not how it will be done. There are already too many stories of false positives and cases of guilty until proven innocent and it's clear that legislators are either too stupid to understand the technical problems with backdooring encryption or are malicious and just want more surveillance.

I've got nothing to hide. If you visit me in person you're more than welcome to go through all of my private messages and emails as long as you're only looking at them with your own eyes. I genuinely don't care. But I do care about people being able to hide perfectly normal things if they need to- it's human nature. Plus, in a democracy, there will be things you need to hide to prevent malicious capture of the government by bad actors. This means privacy is worth it even if it means criminals will hide things too (though they'll do that regardless of if there is mass surveillance or not- only normal people lose if legislation like this passes).

Am I going insane or is the average Joe too distracted, complacent and/or stupid to realise how big of an issue such legislation is?

Oh, and if you disagree with me, I'd love to hear why. Having strong opinions is pretty stupid if you're never open to criticism and dissent.

<summary>u/barthib updates us on the debate around the 32 ETH validator limit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14q5dmj/daily_general_discussion_july_4_2023/jqmmcom/)

There is a disadvantage to this great improvement though: you stop receiving your rewards every 5 days. If you want to extract your yield periodically, you have to unstake and sell and restake regularly.

With all the delays implied, during which you get 0 APR, is it worth compounding? You can already compound by buying rETH or using an exchange, without locking your rewards nor unstaking.

**Due to this drawback, will whales and exchanges really use this new system ? I doubt it , so I doubt that the number of validators will significantly decrease (which is the goal).**

I'm afraid that we will end up with either rotating validators (the first idea suggested long ago to solve the problem) or a simple onboarding halt at 1M validators: the system stops processing the entry queue which grows and is only advanced each time an active validator exits.
