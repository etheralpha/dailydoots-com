I deposited my ETH into the staking contract 871 days ago. Later, on 1 Dec 2020, Beacon Chain launched, and since then my solo staking rig has been running 24/7 with near perfect uptime. Total downtime amounts to probably less than half an hour. I've earned a nice amount in consensus and execution rewards.  Operationally it has cost me nearly nothing, about ¬£100-150 in electricity over the 2 or so years, and about 12 hours of my time. It runs in a fanless case, so I don't even hear it. I sometimes forget it even exists. It contributes to the Ethereum network and is a source of passive income that has truly no intrusion in my life. And yet, I can't wait to instantaneously exit all of my validators and dump all of my ETH later tonight.

<summary>u/Yeopaa shares a great personal story with thanks to this subreddit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12d9ndu/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2023/jf7hy4w/)

Hello ethfam,

I'm going to try not to drag this out. Those of you that know little bits of my life from what I've shared here know that I first entered the ethereum space at the beginning of covid. I was supposed to fly from Ireland to the Philippines to finally marry my long term girlfriend of 13 years when covid put a two year halt on it. For those two years I saved like a motherfucker and invested hard into eth and its ecosystem. Initially with a percentage of money that was for a wedding, then ramping up the DCAs more and more over time.

Last May I celebrated my marriage in the Philippines here with all of you. It was a long time in the making.

Three months ago, after a long and arduous (and expensive + paper heavy) process, my wife and I managed to secure a spousal visa for her to come live with me.

And that brings us to about an hour ago - after three days of literally no sleep I've secured a property here for us. I'm not exaggerating when I say in this timeframe none of this would have been remotely possible without this subreddit. Ethfinance is the flame that keeps my passion burning. A massive thanks to Arbitrum for that ridiculous airdrop also. 

I'm proud to say that, thanks to this space, I will be flying out once more to the other side of the world next month for my 1 year anniversary, but this time my wife is finally coming back with me, with my surname, a secured visa and her name on a frankly beautiful and much too big property.

Thank you everyone. It's the next chapter for me. Now I can finally start planning for solo staking.

Keep 'er lit,

- Yeopaa.

<summary> u/696_eth introduces us to the ENS NameWrapper</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12eagbz/daily_general_discussion_april_7_2023/jfaaq5b/)

ENS NameWrapper that has been in works for years is going to be activated soon (within 24ish), [the vote has passed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42973781582803845389836855775840822719678533376883030929209752909248937768242) and there is a 2 day time lock.

There's so much untapped potential in it so I'm very excited. And there's already many cool apps that are building on top or utilizing ENS, maybe I'll write about them later, big part of them are still in beta phases or are relatively new and small.

But the one cool thing I wanted to share that might be really useful to you now is this:

so you can create a subdomain aka child, so let's say using mine as an example, *evmaverick*.696.eth

but what might not be intuitive is that you can create a subdomain of that subdomain!

and that's how we get - *337*.evmaverick.696.eth (for context, 337 is my token ID of the lion)

and so on and on - ü¶Å.337.evmaverick.696.eth

Now you can just pick a domain (5 char+ for $5/y) and create subdomains for your vaults, your burner, hot and all other wallets while not paying any extra additional money since subdomains can be free, you only gotta renew your parent, which is 696.eth in my example. Of course, there's so much more options going to be available now cause of fuses (that's a big topic in itself).

<summary>u/FluffayPenguin has some critical wallet security advice</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12g9dz5/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2023/jfjkmym/)

Same thing I told the other sub:

**Don't rely on revokes**

It's good to check your revokes regularly using revoke.cash, but you shouldn't be relying on them.

The SushiSwap hack is one of those cases where a hardware wallet wouldn't have saved you, and revoking would've been too late.

**Using Minimum allowance is the Best Practice**

The best practice is to approve ONLY the exact amount of tokens you needed to make a swap so that once your swap is complete, the allowance automatically goes back down to 0.

* For example, if you approve 300 tokens and swap 250 tokens, your allowance for a particular spender goes down from 300 to 50 tokens after the swap
* So if you approve of 300 tokens and swap exactly 300 tokens, the allowance goes down to 0 and that router can't spend anymore.

I know it sucks to make a new approvals on L1 Ethereum where gas fees are expensive. But on cheaper networks, you really have no excuse.

Fortunately, many newer tokens allow permits instead of revokes, which combines an approval and transfer into 1 transaction.

Curious to see what happens next. Expecting to see this spark a new debate about MEV and everything surrounding it.

Sad to see that the thing I warned people about 6 months ago finally happened.

After RCPSwap and SushiSwap first launched, I noticed that 99% of users were setting **unlimited approvals** and warned the community about it.

Back then, there were no front-end revoke tools for Arbitrum Nova like revoke.cash, and Metamask's approval UI was less transparent, so [I wrote a guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMoons/comments/xzn3gj/how_to_revoke_unlimited_approval_on_arbitrum_nova/) on how revoke manually using the Moons contract.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard talked crypto with the family at Easter</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12h7qgo/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2023/jfnvog9/)

I was talking with some family friends today for Easter brunch and, being polite, they asked me about some crypto topics. I ended up explaining the basics of lending in crypto which I'm going to paraphrase here. This is probably one of those things everyone here already knows but which might be useful if you ever need to explain this to someone outside this space.

There are three ways we facilitate lending in crypto today:

1) Overcollateralization. You post collateral worth more than what you're borrowing. In Tradfi this is basically the structure of every mortgage/car loan. You use the property you are buying as collateral for the mortgage itself. This works best for assets that are unlikely to sharply depreciate in value and put lenders underwater. In Defi, that property obviously doesn't hold so we add self-liquidating mechanisms to this system. If your collateral ever falls in value relative to your loan you forfeit the collateral to repay the debt automatically. We mostly use these loans for financial speculation or retaining price exposure to an asset while effectively selling some of it. 

2) Flash Loans. We let you borrow as much money as you want on the condition that you have to repay it instantly. I find this is the most confusing one to people at face value but it makes sense to most people when explained in terms of originating mortgages. Again, mortgages are overcollateralized loans. Without flashloans there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem where without the loan you can't buy the property and without the property you can't get the loan. In Tradfi they have an intermediary facilitate this by effectively granting you a short term loan. In Defi, that's just involving an unnecessary middleman so we dispense with it.

3) Leverage. You can use 1 ETH to buy 3 ETH and exaggerated effects as the price goes up and down. This is similar to overcollateralized lending except we don't actually *give you* the 3 ETH. It's held in escrow by some contract so you can't run away with it. In the example above if your collateral falls by 1/3 in value you get margin called and liquidated. This is really no different than how it works on traditional brokerages. The main difference with Defi is while things like naked shorting are *illegal* in Tradfi brokerages, they are *impossible* in Defi.

That leads us to the last form of debt most people know: uncollateralized lending based on credit. While there are some teams experimenting with this, we just can't bootstrap these systems effectively until we solve the problem of accountability. IRL it is both difficult and illegal to set up multiple identities. On blockchains it is trivial and there is no such thing as the police. If I am willing to give an anonymous stranger $10 on credit I at least need to know that if they rug me they can only do that *once*. That at least means I can only get rugged 7 billion times. Identity theft and fraud are already a problem in Tradfi. In Defi, the problem is so much worse that what you take for granted with a credit card today can't even get started. We may see a Tradfi equivalent to credit systems on a blockchain once a government decides to build a system to certify an identity on chain and integrate their legal system with smart contracts for enforcement but we'd really like to see a more decentralized approach.

There are numerous advantages to eventually solving this problem on the blockchain. For people with existing access to credit, a technology called zero knowledge proofs adds privacy protection so Experion doesn't repeatedly leak your personal data to identity thieves. Next, is consumer choice: the market would be free to create a much wider array of credit score services rather than the regulatory captured monopolies we have today. Last, ironically is scalability; not in transaction throughput but in customers. Right now credit services are available to a minority of people, mostly in first world countries. If this becomes solved in Defi in a decentralized way it can be scaled to all of humanity rather than the limited countries credit services exist in today. This is where a company like Visa will actively get involved eventually because it is a Trillion dollar opportunity that will let them expand their user base.

These systems won't take root in Defi until we have a good system for proving an address belongs to someone and that they singularly claim that address for these credit systems. Once we have that we'll see a variety of credit score DAOs appear in short order. They will essentially act like competing underwriters but unlike Tradfi the performance of each will be public and every app will be free to choose whose opinion they respect and pay for.

I'm also still curious about [alternative credit systems](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty).

[u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy):

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider) and the EVMavs have done it again! We're creating another project similar to EIPandas to celebrate the Shapella hardfork! There are 3240 owls from 20 powlyments minting on Arbitrum for 0.00324 ETH, or 0.0019 ETH for the allOWList [https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls](https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls) We plan to hold a virtual mint party using oncyber so we can show off the artwork gallery style. The mint button will even be embedded into the virtual room!

Proceeds will fund the next EVMaverick public goods project. I know there's someone out there with an idea here that deserves funding!

We had a lot of fun using the beta of AutoMinter's new AI Art Generator for this collection! I had so much fun making this project that I'm raffling away 5 of my EIPandas to those who can use their referral link to get 5 friends onto the list!

And of course, thank you so much to the ethfinance community. I gravitated here when I was new to crypto because of the high level discussion. I "earned" my Maverick asking questions here knowing I could always get an informative response. I probably would have lost all my money to shitcoins without this subreddit, but thanks to y'all I'm staking and having the time of my life making AI owls.

As [u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy) mentioned we are excited to celebrate Shapellowl with you!

To commemorate we've created "Withdrowls!" 

They are intended to be fun, punny, celebratory NFTs for the community, AND as a special treat MANY members of our communities (ethfinanciers, daily dooters & EVM's) will have their own personalized punny owl name in the metadata to be "their own withdrowl" as a special little sentiment to commemorate the momentous occasion. 

Bob-Rowlssi, swagtimusprowl, owlexiskef anyone??  :P [u/Bob-Rossi](https://reddit.com/u/Bob-Rossi), [u/alexiskef](https://reddit.com/u/alexiskef) , [u/swagtimusprime](https://reddit.com/u/swagtimusprime)

ALL funds (100% of mint & royalties) from the Withdrowls will go towards funding the NEXT public goods project after rocketschool anyone in our community wants to create! 

We thought this would be a great way to incentivize people that have an idea to start building and to get people excited and involved in creating public goods/doing something new AND get funded for it!

Check out the Allowl list for additional details! Mint will be .0019 for allowlist and .00324 for public and will be on arbitrum for low fees!

Looking forward to all the Shapellowl celebrations! Will definitely be a hoot ;)

<summary>u/Ethical-trade talks about Ultra Sound things</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12i920r/daily_general_discussion_april_11_2023/jft3t1h/)

Just stumbled upon [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xqyt74/comment/iqdxblk/) I made a few months ago in here: 

*"Any day could end up being the day there's been the most eth in existence ever."*

Happened to be posted less than 10 days from the peak on October 8.

Ether's supply has been going down since October 8. 

Checking [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) has become part of my daily routine even though no new information is really to be expected, I just find it soothing to look at, to marvel at. The Ethereum community has really created something never seen before: a system with a security that's economically self sufficient. 

I truly regret that the mainstream understanding of inflation is "price of things goes up" instead of what it truly is: "value of fiat goes down". This simple switch in mental model would be incredibly useful for the masses to realize some of the biggest and inherent problems with the current system. 

And at the same time, it would be incredibly useful to understand what's so special with eth.

It's been 208 days since the merge and there's been a net burn of more than 82,000 eth. During a bear market (or well, an eternal crab, hail). Total supply is now 120,438,242 eth, and it's clear we'll end up below 120,000,000 sooner or later. 

Since the merge deflation has been accelerating. But what will this look like during a bull market? When usage, euphoria, and greed go parabolic? When the supply is inversely proportional to the mania? 

Witnessing the supply chart take a vertical dive will be absolutely glorious for sure.

We'll soon visit the abyss.

This it how the Euler exploiter saga ends.

When the exploit happened a month ago, I would not have expected that we'd reach this step, all the funds I deployed there I've written off. The Euler saga is a unique story, full of drama and in my case a happy end. 

Those who deployed via a smart contract (e.g. aztec users) need some more patience as those affected users can't claim directly.

Happy Shapella Day and stay safe out there, fellow Ethfinancers!
